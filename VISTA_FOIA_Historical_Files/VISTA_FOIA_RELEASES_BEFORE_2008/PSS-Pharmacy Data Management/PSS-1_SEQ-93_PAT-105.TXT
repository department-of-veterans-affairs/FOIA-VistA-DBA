  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch exports a routine that can be invoked by any Vista application
  in accordance with some supported references. For that reason, it is
  recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a
  minimum.
  
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*105)
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*105.
   
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
   
  8. When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
   
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
