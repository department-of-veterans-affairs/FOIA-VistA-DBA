Subject: DATA UPDATES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
  
 This patch generates three mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
 to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security 
 key, and the person installing the patch.  The first message, with the
 subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if one exists),
 dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the national
 formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
 CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
 changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
 interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
 the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
 DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
