Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC)  will install Patch 
 IVMB*2.0*867 before January 1, 2006.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2005-064 - This patch MUST be installed before 
 January 1, 2006.  The patch is being released as an emergency patch 
 (together with EAS*1.0*69 and IB*2.0*331) and may be installed out of

 The Means Test thresholds for income year 2005 provided in VHA DIRECTIVE 
 2005-064, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR 
 CALENDAR YEAR 2006 are distributed with this patch.  The 
 post-installation routine, DG53686P, will create a new subentry (or 
 replace an existing one) for calendar year 2006 in the MEANS TEST DATA 
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS Parameters (#43) file.  Six subfields 
 within the multiple will be updated with the new Means Test threshold 
 data values as follows:
  
        MEANS TEST DATA (#.01) - 2006
        MT COPAY EXEMPT VET INCOME (#2)  - $26,902
        MT COPAY EXEMPT 1ST DEP INCOME (#3) - $5,383
        MT COPAY EXEMPT INCOME PER DEP (#4) - $1,806
        THRESHOLD PROPERTY (#8) - $80,000
        CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION (#17) - $8,450
  
 In addition, this patch will update the following fields in the 
 Parameters file (#8989.5) for 2005 to:
  
        DGMT MAPR GLOBAL RATE         5
        DGMT MAPR 0 DEPENDENTS        10579
        DGMT MAPR 1 DEPENDENTS        13855
        DGMT MAPR N DEPENDENTS        1806
  
 This patch, DG*5.3*686 is one of three VistA 2006 threshold patches.  It  
 updates the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual Pension 
 Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*69 will address the annual updates for the GMT 
 Thresholds and patch IB*2.0*331 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.

       ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation will 
 take approximately 15 minutes.  The Geographic Means Test Threshold files 
 GMT THRESHOLDS #712.5 and GMT MSA CODE #712.6 updates (for every zip code 
 and every county) in patch EAS*1.0*69, are extensive.  Due to the volume 
 of updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop.  
 This is normal, as the file updates may take up to 15 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 after entries will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are 
 approximately 16,000 entries included in the #712.5 file (and 
 approximately 50,000 entries included in the #712.6 file) distributed 
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is 
 possible your session may time out before the install has completed.  If 
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.  
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
  
  
   1.   Optional: If you choose to disable journaling on the process level,
        prior to installing this patch and at the programmers prompt type
