Subject: ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will contain enhancements to the cycle 1 encapsulation APIs.
   
 A new API is added with this patch that returns information from the
 NDC/UPN file (#50.67). See DBIA 4829 for complete information.
  
 A new field has been added to the return data of DATA^PSN50P68 component 
 of DBIA 4545. It is the SERVICE CODE field (#2000) of the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68). The field is being sent out in National Drug File patch
 PSN*4*103.
  
 A change has been made to the DIC^PSNDI and IX^PSNDI components of DBIA 
 4554. DIC("S") will be killed within these components. If the file you 
 are passing in has an INACTIVATION DATE field, and you want to screen on 
 that field, a new date input parameter is being added to the components, 
 and if a date is passed in, a screen will be set for the calling 
 application.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
 from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation includes:
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PHAR_1_API_R0206.PDF             Updated Pharmacy Re-Engineering API

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  This patch exports routines that are supported references, so any other 
  Vista application can make a call to this routine. For that reason, it is
  recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a 
  minimum.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*109)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*109.
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
  
 8. When prompted "Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
