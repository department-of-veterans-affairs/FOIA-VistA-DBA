Subject: ADD NEW INJECTION PROMPT FIELD

Category:

  - Input Template
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. A site reported a problem with the medication route being blank on the
 Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 Virtual Due List. During
 investigation of possible corrections for this, it was determined that
 another issue needed to be addressed with how to determine when to prompt
 for an injection site. This patch assists to correct this problem by
 adding the PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE IN BCMA field (#8) to the MEDICATION
 ROUTES file (#51.2). In addition, the new field has been added to the
 input template PSS MEDICATION ROUTES. HD0000000166204, HD0000000164890,
 PSI-06-152, PSI-06-158.
  
 2. During internal testing, it was discovered that there was a problem 
 with the Application Programming Interface (API) handled by routine 
 PSS55. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 3. Currently, BCMA relies upon certain characters being present in the 
 Medication Route name or abbreviation to determine which tab to display an
 order on. This patch helps to alleviate that issue by adding the DSPLY ON
 IVP/IVPB TAB IN BCMA? field (#9) to the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2). In
 addition, the new field has been added to the input template PSS
 MEDICATION ROUTES.
  
 4. To assist Pharmacy in appropriately setting the new PROMPT FOR INJ.
 SITE IN BCMA field (#8) as well as the new DSPLY ON IVP/IVPB TAB IN BCMA?
 field (#9), a search routine will execute when this patch is installed.
 The purpose of this routine is to look for all Medication Route
 abbreviations that contain ID, IV, IM, SC or SQ. A MailMan message with
 the subject of "PDM - Check Med Route Abbreviations" will be sent to the
 person who installs the patch. Pharmacy should review these lists to
 determine how to appropriately set the two new fields.
