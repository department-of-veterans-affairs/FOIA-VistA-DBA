Subject: DD update for VMS printers

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Patch Tracking #: 39737537
 Test Sites: Cache conversion sites, Mt. Home TN, Ann Arbor MI, MARTINEZ CA.
 Blood Bank Clearance: N/A
  
 NOIS: ZZZ-1204-N1237/HD0000000064552
 Problem : Cache resets $Y to 0 after it gets to 65535 and certain terminal 
 types at sites have the number of lines set to 99999. This causes a 
 problem when the device handler attempts to pad the output until $Y 
 reached 99999 but at 65535, $Y got reset to 0. It just kept looping and 
 adding LINE FEEDS to the output until the disk filled up. 
  
 FIX: Change the field definition for Device File (#3.5) PAGE LENGTH (#11)
 and Terminal type (#3.2) PAGE LENGTH (#3) to have a max value of 65500.
 A small post-init routine will scan the files and replace any values that
 Currently exceed the maximum value of 65500.
  
 This patch also has a update to the Device file (#3.5) DD for field 
 VMS DEVICE TYPE (#63).  This is to work with changes that the HSITES
 has made to the SYSPRINT.COM file for VMS printer setup.
