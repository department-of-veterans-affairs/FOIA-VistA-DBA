 This patch is part of a combined KIDS build (CSV HDS 1.0) that contains 4 
 Health Data Systems patches to support Code Set Versioning under the
 Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  These
 patches are contained within a single host file: CSV_HDS_1_0.KID
  
  The four patches included in this KIDS build are :
                   GMPL*2.0*28
                   OR*3.0*181
                   GMRC*3.0*33
                   TIU*1.0*161
  
 The following changes/enhancements will be made to the CPRS List Manager 
 interface to make it compliant with Code Set Versioning requirements of 
 HIPAA.
  
 1) When a new Consult or Procedure Order is entered, CPRS will ensure 
 that the selected provisional diagnosis has an active ICD9 code for the 
 order date.  When a provisional diagnosis is entered for a consult order, 
 CPRS will display a list of only diagnoses that have active ICD9 codes 
 for the consult order date.  
  
 2) When a Consult or Procedure Order is copied to create a new order, 
 CPRS will evaluate the provisional diagnosis code to ensure that it has 
 an active ICD9 code for the order date.  If the provisional diagnosis has 
 a code that is inactive for the order date, an error message will be 
 displayed and prompt the user to edit the provisional diagnosis.
  
 3) When editing an unreleased consult or procedure order, if the 
 provisional diagnosis is edited, only diagnoses with ICD9 codes that are 
 active for the current date will be selectable.
  
 4) CPRS has developed a protocol that will subscribe to the ICD Code Set 
 Update Protocols.  This protocol will be a background job that is 
 activated when a new ICD9 code set version is implemented. When an ICD9 
 Code Set is updated, CPRS will evaluate each Consult and Procedure Quick 
 Order Dialog for a provisional diagnosis with an inactivated ICD9 code. 
 Any Consult or Procedure quick order with a provisional diagnosis having 
 an inactivated code, will be included in a MailMan message sent to 
 members of the ORCM CSV EVENT mail group. This message will include the 
 name of the Consult or Procedure quick order dialog and urge them to edit 
 the predefined provisional diagnosis. Any quick orders that have a 
 provisional diagnosis code that is due to be inactivated in the future 
 will also be listed in the message along with a message to urge those 
 managing quick orders to edit provisional diagnosis as soon as practical.
  
 5) CPRS has developed a new option (ORCM GMRC CSV CHECK) for Clinical 
 Application Coordinators and IRM staff to manually initiate evaluation of 
 the provisional diagnosis in Consult and Procedure quick orders for an 
 inactivated ICD9 code. This option will create a report that includes the 
 name of the Consult or Procedure quick order. Any quick orders that have 
 a provisional diagnosis code that is due to be inactivated in the future 
 will also be listed in the report along with a message to urge those 
 managing quick orders to edit the provisional diagnosis as soon as 
 practical.
  
 6) CPRS will evaluate problems on the active problem list to identify 
 those entries with codes that are inactive for the current date. Those 
 problems found to have an inactive code associated will display with a # 
 sign next to them in the problem list display.
