 ==============
 1)  ISP-1104-N1817   UPDATES TO THE LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS
                      WORKSHEET
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE worksheet for LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS, to add a new
     sentence to 3 different paragraphs.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA86PI which will deactivate the
         current LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS worksheet (file 396.6,
         IEN 188), and activate the new LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS
         worksheet (file 396.6, IEN 195).
     b)  Created routine DVBCWLL3 and DVBCWLL4 that contain the text for
         the LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWLLA to access the text routines in b),
         and print the new LIVER, GALL BLADDER AND PANCREAS worksheet.
