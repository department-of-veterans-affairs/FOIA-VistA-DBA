Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses follow-up issues related to the Surgery Electronic 
 Signature for Operative Reports patch (SR*3*100).
  
 1. Converted documents for historical surgical/non-OR cases are stored in 
    the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925) with a status of COMPLETED, but they 
    have no signature date. Therefore, when one of these converted
    documents is printed, the following line is printed at the end of the
    document text:
  
 **DRAFT COPY - DRAFT COPY -- ABOVE NOTE IS UNSIGNED-- DRAFT COPY - DRAFT COPY**
  
    This patch modifies the routine SROESPR1 to prevent the display of this
    line if the document has a status of COMPLETED. See NOIS
    FAR-0104-40622.
  
 2. The input template SROARPT is used by the Anesthesia Report [SROARPT] 
    option to edit fields that are part of the Anesthesia Report. This 
    patch modifies this input template to remove the INTRAOPERATIVE
    OCCURRENCES field (#1.14) and the POSTOP OCCURRENCE field (#1.16) since
    these two fields do not appear on the Anesthesia Report.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation takes
 less than two minutes. This patch can be installed at any time.
 Installation of this patch should NOT be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.

     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*128.
