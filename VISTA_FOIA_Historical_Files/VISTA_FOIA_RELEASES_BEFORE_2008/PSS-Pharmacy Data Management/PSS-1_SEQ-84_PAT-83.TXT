 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 NYH-1103-11819  DOSAGE STRENGTH DISCREPANCY
  
 Problem:
 ========
 In DBIA 3739 and DBIA 3233 when an orderable item is selected it 
 sometimes shows an incorrect dosage for the selected drug. This occurs 
 in both CPRS and Vista. This can occur when an orderable item has
 different dosage units (ie. GM & MG). The units variable is not properly 
 handled and the order can display the unit of a dosage that preceded it 
 in the list.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Reset dosage unit for each drug in an orderable item.
  
 Technical Summary:
 ==================
 DBIA 3739 is the IA for CPRS.  Routine PSSOPKI1.
 DBIA 3233 is the IA Add Order (Vista).  Routine PSSORUTL.
  
 Both routines did not handle the units variable correctly.  This has been 
 corrected in this patch.

 ********************************************************************
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: 
               Select Install Packages(s)
  
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*83):
  
      a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      b.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*83.
  
      a.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
          YES//', respond NO.
