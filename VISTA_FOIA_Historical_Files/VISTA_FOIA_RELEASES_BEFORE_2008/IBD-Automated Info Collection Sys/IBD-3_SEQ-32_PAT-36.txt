Subject: AICS MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA (MST) ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  This patch provides enhancements to the Automated Information Collection
  System (AICS) software to allow the Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
  indicator to be collected, transmitted, and filed in the Patient Care
  Encounter (PCE) files for applicable outpatient encounter visits.
  
  VHA Directive 10-95-030, "Sexual Trauma Counseling Care and Services",
  stated that VHA may provide appropriate care and counseling to veterans
  determined to have been a victim of a physical assault of a sexual
  nature. The Veterans Millenium Health Care and Benefits Act, Public Law
  106-117 (signed into law on 11/30/99), makes the Sexual Trauma Counseling
  program mandatory, extends it into 2004, and expands it to include former
  members of Armed Forces reserve components. The law also requires the VA
  report to Congress on program activities by 1/31/01.  This patch
  supports the ability of VHA to meet this reporting requirement.
  
  The following NOIS issues are also addressed in this patch:

  Technical Description:
  ======================
  
  A. This patch uses supported APIs from the DGMST Registration package
     to facilitate the entry and retrieval of Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
     status information.  Due to potential sensitivity issues, the Women's
     Veterans Health Group has requested that the acronym MST be used in
     place of the words 'Military Sexual Trauma' on encounter forms.
  
  B. This patch will add eight new AICS encounter form (EF) blocks to
     the AICS Tool Kit.  A summary description of each new encounter form
     block is listed below:

  C. It is important to note that all existing AICS Tool Kit encounter
     form blocks will remain intact and will NOT be overwritten by the new
     encounter form blocks added with this patch.  These encounter form
     blocks will be added to the AICS Tool Kit and are available for sites
     to add to their existing encounter forms.
  
     1) To facilitate locating the encounter forms containing the existing
        encounter form blocks, a mail message with the subject 'Patch
        IBD*3*36 Encounter Form Block Report' will be generated when the
        patch is installed and will be sent to the patch installer.  The
        mail message contains a report that will assist the user by
        providing the following:
  
        a) A summary list containing the old encounter form block name and
           new encounter form block name.
  
        b) Each detail line contains:
           1. The existing encounter form block and encounter form where
              the block is located.
           2. The clinic and division using the encounter form.
  
  D. The new encounter form tool kit block, SC CONDITIONS (V2.1 MST),
     contains the following new line:
  
               No classifications applicable to visit:  [  ]
  
     This was added to clarify that no classification bubbles were filled
     in because they did not apply to the visit.  The bubbled area is
     scannable, and will remove ALL classifications related to the visit
     if the bubble is marked and scanned.
  
  E. AICS Manual Data Entry processes were also modified to add the MST
     treatment question.  This is only displayed if applicable (i.e. the
     patient was screened for MST).
  
  
  Implementation:
  ===============
  
  A. Instructions to replace an existing encounter form block and add a
     new encounter form block from the AICS Tool Kit to an encounter form:
  
     1) Locate the clinic (and division if necessary) of the encounter
        form using the mail message 'Patch IBD*3*36 Encounter Form Block
        Report' generated by this patch and described in section C above.
  
     2) In the Encounter Forms menu option [IBDF ENCOUNTER FORM], select
        EE  Edit Encounter Forms [IBDF EDIT ENCOUNTER FORM].
  
     3) In the Edit Encounter Forms menu option, select  
        ED  Clinic Setup/Edit Forms [IBDF CLINIC SETUP/EDIT FORMS], and
        enter the clinic name that is using the encounter form.
  
     4) A list of encounter forms used by the clinic will appear.  At this
        point, a backup copy of the form may be created by using the
        CF  Copy Form [IBDF COPY FORM BLOCK] action to copy the form to
        another form name.  Choose the defaults presented, and when asked
        'How should the clinic use the form?', select 'Reserved for Future
        Use'.
  
     5) Edit the desired form by selecting  EF  Edit Form [IBDF EDIT FORM]
        and the form number on the list (i.e. EF=1 if there is more than
        one form on the list).  The encounter form will be built and will
        display on the screen.  Find the encounter form block you wish to
        change on the encounter form and note its placement (i.e. the
        block's row, start and end columns, and how many lines high it is).
        This will help to prevent creating overlapping encounter form
        blocks on the form.
  
     6) When correct placement of the block has been determined, delete the
        old encounter form block by selecting  DB  Delete Block [IBDF 
        DELETE A BLOCK]. Add the new encounter form block by selecting
        AT  Add Toolkit Block [IBDF DISPLAY TOOLKIT BLOCKS FOR ADDING]
        and choosing the desired Tool Kit Block from the list presented.
  
     7) After the new encounter form has been created, the backup copy of
        the encounter form may be deleted using the  DS  Delete from Setup
        [IBDF DELETE FROM CLINIC SETUP] action.
