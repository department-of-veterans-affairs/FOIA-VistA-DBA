Description: 
============

 Overview of NOIS: 
 ================
    This patch deals with several NOIS issues.    
  
 NOIS BUT-0298-21063, WIM-0597-20377, TUC-1196-60306, LEB-0498-20167 
 When using the option Ad Hoc Report [QAC ADHOC] users cannot
 consistently sort on a range of just one Issue Code.  If one issue code is
 used for the range user gets message "NO RECORDS TO PRINT".  This problem
 does not happen with all Issue Codes.
  
               ********************NOTE********************
 The changes made to fix this problem make it essential that Patient
 Representative users have read access to files CONSUMER CONTACT
 (#745.1), CONTACT ISSUE CODE (#745.2), CONTACT DISCIPLINES (#745.5)
 and QAC SERVICE/DISCIPLINE (#745.55).  If your site is running Kernel part
 III the users must have file security access to these same files.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 NOIS BRX-1097-11968 
 Users report that when trying to print a hard copy of alerts they get
 error saying "No Device Open".  
  
 NOIS LOM-1197-60643, LON-0398-61798, BRX-0498-12267 
 When calling report Discipline Issue Totals using option Discipline Issue
 Totals [QAC DISC ISSUE TOT] and not specifying a single Discipline, an
 undefined variable error occurred.
  
 UNREPORTED PROBLEM
 When using the option Ad Hoc Report [QAC ADHOC], the user supplied sort
 and print qualifiers were not being properly applied to the Persian Gulf
 Service field.
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu Option (file #19) and all of its descendants be disabled to
 prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other DHCP
 users will not be affected.
  
        Patient Representative Manager Menu [QAC MAIN MENU]

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - QACDISC

 In DATE+11, check value of QACDSC before doing $TR on it.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - QACRPT

 Added new entry point for QACALRT1 to display to screen (but not print).
 New entry point avoids line START^QACRPT that reads U IO --- since it's
 just going to screen don't need the USE command.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - QACALRT1

 Call START1^QACRPT instead of START^QACRPT, avoiding the line U IO, since
 this routine wants to display information only on the screen.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - QACADHOC

 Changed lines for Issue Code line and Persian Gulf Service in Ad Hoc
 menu listing.
