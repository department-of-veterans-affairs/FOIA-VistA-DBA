Subject: QUALITY ASSURANCE Y2K CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch contains changes to routine QAQDATE to prevent year 2000
 problems.
  
 There are no E3Rs asociated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 ISH-1197-40971
 --------------
 When calling reports such as the Customer Service Standards Report [QAC
 CSS] and using the YEARLY date range, there is a problem entering the
 year.  If you enter the year as a 2 digit number the system asks
  
        "By '97' do you mean 1997? //YES" 
  
 But does not accept the default answer and requires entry of a 4 digit
 year.
  
 The date selection routine (QAQDATE) has been altered to properly handle
 the year entry both when using the YEARLY date range and the QUARTERLY
 date range.  The change uses the callable FileMan routine ^%DT instead of
 evaluating the date as a part of the Integration Module. The %DT FileMan
 routine is currently being patched as part of the Year 2000 project.
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other DHCP users will not be affected.
  
     [QAC MAIN MENU]           Patient Representative Manager Menu
     [QAOS USER MENU]          Occurrence Screening User Menu
     [QAN INCIDENT REPORT]     Brief Incident Edit
     [QAN INCIDENT MAIN MENU]  Incident Reporting Main Menu
     [QAN MANAGER MENU]        Incident Reporting Managers Menu
     [QAM PGMR MENU]           Monitoring System Programmer Menu
