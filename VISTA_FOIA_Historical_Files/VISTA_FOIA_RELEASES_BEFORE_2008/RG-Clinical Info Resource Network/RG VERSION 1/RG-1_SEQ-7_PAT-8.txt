Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*4, RG*1.0*7 and DG*5.3*307 are required builds for patch
  RG*1.0*8.
   
  For Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and
  Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0 sites, Clinical Information
  Resource Network (CIRN) patch RG*1.0*8 should be installed immediately
  after DG*5.3*307.  For all other sites, RG*1.0*8 will be installed as
  part of your CIRN PD/MPI installation weekend.
   
  1.)  The concatenated text in an exception message became too long,
  causing a string length error that was reported in NOIS BAC-0700-40543.
  The error occurred for exception entry number 210, "Patient DFN Failed,"
  in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION TYPE (#991.11) file, while executing routine
  RGJCREC.  Message text has been modified in RGJCREC, RGRSDYN, RGRSDYN1
  and RGRSDYN2 to correct this problem.
   
  2.)  The format of the sending facility was changed in patch
  DG*5.3*307.  Corresponding changes were made in RGRSMSH and RGADT.
  A change was made to pass the value of HL("SFN") in the string
  returned from RGRSMSH instead of the proper name of the institution
  from the INSTITUTION (#4) file.  The conversion from the station number
  to the institution name occurs in RGADT.  This resolves NOIS messages
  MAD-0800-41753, SLC-0800-52676, AMA-0900-70296, ALX-0900-70340,
  NIN-0900-41380 and CMO-0900-42286.
   
  3.)  The "CIRN - PATIENT NOT FOUND" MailMan message generated in RGRSPT
  has been replaced with a "Patient DFN Failed" exception message if an
  invalid subscription occurs.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 1 minute.
   
  1.  For existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites, patch RG*1.0*8 should be
      installed immediately after DG*5.3*307.  For all other sites,
      RG*1.0*8 will be installed during your CIRN PD/MPI installation
      weekend.  In either case, if you have not done so previously for
      the installation of DG*5.3*307, you should do the following.
      Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM 
      SCHEDULE], unschedule the following option:
        VAFC BATCH UPDATE          UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3
   
  2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  3.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*8).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*8.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
  9.  Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE],
      schedule the option VAFC BATCH UPDATE [UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3]
      to run every 10 minutes.
   
  10. If you are installing patches DG*5.3*307 and RG*1.0*8 sequentially
      as advised, remember to complete Step 13 of the installation
      instructions for DG*5.3*307 to restart the filers.
