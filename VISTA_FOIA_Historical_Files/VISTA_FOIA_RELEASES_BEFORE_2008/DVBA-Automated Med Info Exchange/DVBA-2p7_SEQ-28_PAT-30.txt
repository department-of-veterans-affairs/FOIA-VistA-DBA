Subject: Print blank C&P worksheets.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  I. Functional Overview
  ----------------------
  A C&P worksheet could only be printed for open 2507 requests
  associated with the worksheet. It was not possible to choose to print
  blank C&P worksheets.
  
  Reference NOIS ALB-0499-53146.
  
  II. Technical Overview
  ----------------------
  This patch adds a menu option named Print Blank C&P Worksheet under the
  Medical Administration C&P Menu. With this option, the users can choose
  from a list of worksheets to print out the desired one. They will no longer
  need to search for the right patient who happens to have the wanted
  worksheet in order to print it out. In addition, the worksheet to be
  printed out will not have any patient-specific information on it.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation will take
  less than 3 minutes.
  
                        **Warning**
  When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
  is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question. If you choose to have KIDs rebuild the
  menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may take
  several hours.
  Note: Most sites have a nightly batch job that rebuilds the menus so if
  you queued the installations ensure that it will complete prior to the
  batch job.  Or, if you are installing several builds, wait until the last one
  to use the KIDs rebuild functionality.
                            ****
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
       TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
       patch text only.]
  
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
       SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
       at this time.
 
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*30):
  
  Note - if a multi-build install, options (b.) (c.) and (d.) must be run for
  each individual patch/build included in this transport.  Only (a.) Backup a
  Transport Global and Installation (step 4) can and must be referenced
  exclusively by the primary patch.
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*30.
  
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
   7.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES?".
       respond NO.
    
   8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
