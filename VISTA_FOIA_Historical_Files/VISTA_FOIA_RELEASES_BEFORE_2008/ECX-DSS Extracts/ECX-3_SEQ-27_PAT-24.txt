   NEW FIELDS IN EXISTING FILES --
    
   A large number of new fields are being added to existing DSS EXTRACTS
   files in this update.  Please consult the Extract Format & Data 
   Definitions Guide for a complete description of updated field 
   definitions.
   
   
   NEW ENTRIES IN EXISTING FILES --
   
   A new entry for the Mental Health extract is being added to the
   EXTRACT DEFINITIONS file (#727.1).  After installation has completed,
   use the Inquire to File Entries of VA FileMan to display information
   about the new Mental Health extract.
    
   Nine new entries are being added to the DSS LAB TESTS file (#727.2).
   The DSS Extract Manager should use the Link DSS Selected Lab Tests 
   to Local Lab Tests option to associate an appropriate test from the
   LABORATORY TEST file (#60) with each of the new entries.  The new
   entries are:
    
      MICROALBUMIN
      HEPATITIS B SURFACE ANTIBODY
      HEPATITIS C ANTIBODY
      HIV ANTIBODY
      CD4 RATIO (T CELL SCREEN)
      HCV-QUANTITATIVE BY PCR
      HIV VIRAL LOAD
      HCV-QUALITATIVE BY PCR
      HIV 1 BY EIA
   
     
   NEW FILES --
    
   DSS MH TESTS (#727.5)
   This file is used to identify Mental Health various tests from the
   MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) for which specific data will be extracted 
   from the PSYCH INSTRUMENT PATIENT file (#601.2).  Do not use FileMan
   to enter/edit data in file #727.5.  All updates to the file will be
   managed by BTSO through nationally released patches.
   
   MENTAL HEALTH EXTRACT (#727.812)
   This file holds the monthly Mental Health extract data to be 
   transmitted to DSS at the Austin Automation Center.
   
   CLINIC I EXTRACT (#727.816)
   This new file replaces the CLINIC EXTRACT file (#727.803).  It holds
   data on clinic visits needed for the CLINIC I (CLI) extract.
   
   CLINIC II EXTRACT (#727.818)
   This new file replaces the CLINIC EXTRACT file (#727.803).  It holds
   data on clinic visits needed for the CLINIC II (CLJ) extract.  When
   the CLINIC I (CLI) extract is generated, transmitted, or purged, the 
   CLINIC II (CLJ) extract will also be automatically generated, 
   transmitted, or purged for the same date range.  
   
   
   NEW AND REVISED MENU OPTIONS --
   
   ECXMTL                Mental Health Extract  (NEW)
                         This option allows the DSS Extract Manager to
                         generate the Mental Health extract.  It is
                         found on the Package Extracts menu.
   
   ECX MTL SOURCE AUDIT  Mental Health (MTL) Extract Audit  (NEW)
                         This option allows the DSS Extract Manager to
                         generate an audit report for a Mental Health
                         extract.  It is found on the Extract Audit 
                         Reports Menu.
    
   ECXSCX                Clinic Visit Extract  (REVISED)
                         This option has been updated to use the new
                         routines and files for the FY2000 Clinic Visit
                         extract process.  Clinic visit data will be
                         placed in both the CLINIC I EXTRACT file 
                         (#727.816) and in the CLINIC II EXTRACT file
                         (#727.818) whenever this option is run.
   
   ECX DIVISION ID       Enter/Edit DSS Division Identifier  (REVISED)
                         It is now possible to assign DSS Division ID
                         codes to medical center divisions which are
                         "Outpatient Only".
   
   ECXDEFINE             Define Extract Schedule  (REVISED)
                         Needed updates to the routines associated with
                         this option have been made, and the option is
                         being placed back in service.
   
   
   NEW MAIL GROUP --
   
   The DSS-MTL mail group is being added in order to receive messages
   regarding generation and transmission of the Mental Health extract.
   Remember to add local users (e.g., the DSS Extracts Manager) as 
   members.
   
   
   ELIMINATION OF TEST PATIENTS --
   
   A consensus has been reached in VistA which allows the entry of 
   "Test Patients" into the database.  DSS Extracts will now prevent
   the extraction of data associated with a Test Patient in all of
   its extract processes.  A "Test Patient" is understood to be a
   record in the PATIENT file (#2) where the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
   field (#.09) begins with "00000".
   
   
   NOIS ISSUES --
     
   This patch also includes corrections which address the following NOIS
   issues:
     
      MIN-0399-42458
      Do not allow entry of alpha characters in credit stop code
      when using Enter/Edit DSS Stop Code for Clinics option.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
   DSS Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been
   completed.  
     
   If you are running the install interactively and not rebuilding user 
   menus, installation will take less than 10 minutes. 
     
   Note:  If you are not running the installation interactively and intend
          to allow KIDS to start the rebuild of user menus upon completion
          of the install, then please queue the install for a period of
          low system activity.
     
   No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
   more than once.
     
   1.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation Menu.
   
       a.  Select the Load a Distribution option.
       b.  At the "Enter a Host File:" prompt enter ECX3_24.KID.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
      
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
      
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*24):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
      
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*24.
       MENTAL HEALTH v5.01 patch YS*5.01*56 is included in the distribution
       file for ECX*3.0*24.  If your site does not use MENTAL HEALTH v5.01,
       you may delete later the one routine (YSDSS) installed by YS*5.01*56.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
    
       Extract Manager's Options   [ECXMGR]
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
    
   8.  After successful installation of this patch, the following routine
       may be deleted:
      
       ECX324PT   (post installation routine)
    
   9.  If your site does NOT use the VistA MENTAL HEALTH v5.01 package,
       you may delete the following routine which was installed by
       YS*5.01*56:
     
       YSDSS
   
  10. If your site does use the VistA MENTAL HEALTH v5.01 package and
      you have not as yet installed patch YS*5.01*31, then re-run routine
      ECX324MH after you have installed YS*5.01*31.  Proceed as follows:
      
      From Programmer Mode --
    
      (a) Be sure that the usual FileMan background variables are set;
