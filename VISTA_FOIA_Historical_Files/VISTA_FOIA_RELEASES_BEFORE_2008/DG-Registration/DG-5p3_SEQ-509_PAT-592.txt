  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  Problem:
  ========
  Patch DG*5.3*529 made the following modification (from the patch
  description quoted below). But in doing so, the Cum ADC totals
  were not printed for level 2 and higher totals. 
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The Cum ADC column is not totalling correctly on the Bed Status Report 
    [DG G&L SHEET] when one or more wards included in the total was placed 
    Out-of-Service (OOS) during the time period covered by the report. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    The Cum ADC totals were being calculated by taking the Cum Patient Days 
    total for all of the wards and dividing by the Total Elapsed Fiscal Days.  
    This does not account for individual wards being placed OOS for time 
    periods during the reporting period (Fiscal YTD). Routine ^DGPMBSP3
    has been modified to calculate the total Cum ADC by adding the ADCs 
    for the individual wards included in the total.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  A small change was made to routine DGPMBSP3 so that the totals now print.
  
  In addition, the CUM ADC column in the Totals by Primary Ward section of the
  BSR was found to have the same problem as described above for CUM ADC totals 
  in the main section of the BSR. Routines DGPMBSP2 and DGPMBSP4 were modified 
  to calculate the Cum ADC totals by Primary Ward Location by adding the ADCs  
  for each ward.
