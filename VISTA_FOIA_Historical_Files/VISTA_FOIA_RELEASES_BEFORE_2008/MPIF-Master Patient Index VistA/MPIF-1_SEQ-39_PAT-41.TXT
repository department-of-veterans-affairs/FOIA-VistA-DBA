Subject: CHANGE TO HL7 ADT-A24 AND ADT-A43 MESSAGE PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE: The functionality in this patch supports the Department of
  Defense (DOD) Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) project.
  This patch must be installed at all facilities before updates
  to the Health Level Seven (HL7) ADT-A24 and ADT-A43 messaging
  can occur for CHDR on the Master Patient Index (MPI).
  INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT: From the date of release, MPIF*1*41
  has a 7-day installation compliance date.
   
  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating
  Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*25, MPIF*1.0*35, MPIF*1.0*37, and RG*1.0*42 are required builds
  for patch MPIF*1*41.
   
  Issue #1:  Message format changes.
  In preparation for updating the Master Patient Index (MPI) Health
  Level Seven (HL7) maintenance messaging, the MPIFA24 and MPIFA43
  routines are being modified to address forward and backwards compatible
  processing of the ADT-A24 and ADT-A43 messages.  This is a technical
  modification to create a consistent and accurate HL7 standard assigning
  location of identifiers established by the MPI and decentralized systems
  that communicate with the MPI.  Routine MPIFA40 was modified to carry
  the "from" DFN in the MRG segment.  Additionally, a variable was cleaned
  up and a change was made to request "all" fields instead of selected
  fields in the PID call.  These changes will not affect users of the VistA
  system.
   
  Issue #2:  Bogus "AICN" cross-reference.
  Occasionally, the "AICN" cross-reference remains when it should have
  been cleaned up.  A check has been added to UPDATE^MPIFAPI1 and GETDFN
  ^MPIF001 to remove a bogus "AICN" cross-reference when it is found to
  exist and the DFN entry does not exist.  This change allows the IMDQ
  team to use an Austin option - Remote ICN, Checksum and CMOR Update
  [MPI DATA MGT REMOTE ICN UPDATE] to address a current exception more
  easily.

  Post-init routine MPIFP41 contains a background job to look for
  patients with erroneous ICN checksum values in the ICN CHECKSUM
  (#991.02) field in the PATIENT (#2) file.  Any checksums that are
  inaccurate will be corrected.  This job is queued to run in the
  background.  At the test sites, an average of 40,000 patients
  per minute were processed.  Therefore, you can calculate your
  approximate run time by dividing the number of patients in your
  PATIENT (#2) file by that average number.  When the job is complete,
  an e-mail message is sent to the installer.  At that point, routine
  MPIFP41 can be deleted from your system.  This e-mail message does
  not include the number of erroneous ICN CHECKSUMS found and corrected,
  as the number has no significance.  An e-mail message is also sent to
  the Master Patient Index (MPI) with statistics for analysis.
    
  FYI - if you run ^XINDEX on routine MPIFA24, a reference to OMGPIDMI
  is displayed as a routine that is not available on your system and
  that is correct.  This relates only to the Federal Health Information
  Exchange (FHIE) Framework system.  This was introduced in an earlier
  patch - MPIF*1.0*25.
