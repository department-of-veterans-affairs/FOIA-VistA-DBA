Subject: Fix Z06 Delete Logic

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Each time a site adds a Means Test, a new record is added to the ANNUAL 
 MEANS TEST File (#408.31) for the veteran as the Primary test on file. 
 This test is transmitted to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) and then 
 shared with all sites visited.  Each time the test is edited/updated then 
 sent to the HEC and shared with the sites, a new record is added to the 
 ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31).  
  
 After transmission to HEC, the case is processed by the Enrollment System 
 Redesign (ESR) Income Verification Match (IVM) software and when the case 
 is closed, and the test status is changed to MT Copay Required, an 
 ORU~Z06 HL7 Transmission is sent to all sites of record for the veteran.  
 This adds a new record to the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) for the 
 veteran as the Primary test on file, and the existing test is updated to 
 Not Primary.  When IVM closes a case and converts a RX Copay Test to 
 Non-Exempt, an ORU~Z07 HL7 Transmission is sent to all sites of record 
 for the veteran.  This adds a new record to the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File 
 (#408.31).  It is possible that there will be two Primary tests for the 
 income year, one is the Means Test and one is the RX Copay Test.
  
 When IVM reopens the case and closes it as not converted, an ORU~Z06 
 (Delete) HL7 Transmission is sent to all sites of record.  This deletes 
 the record from the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31), and makes the site 
 entered test primary.
  
 This patch EAS*1.0*74 is addressing the issue where the site has multiple 
 Not Primary records in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File for the Means Test.  
 Instead of making the previous and most current record Primary, the 
 delete process was making the first entered record primary.
  
 The delete process is being modified to correctly identify the most 
 current Not Primary record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File for this Means 
 Test, and making that record Primary.  The delete process will also 
 correctly delete the IVM Converted RX Copay test.
