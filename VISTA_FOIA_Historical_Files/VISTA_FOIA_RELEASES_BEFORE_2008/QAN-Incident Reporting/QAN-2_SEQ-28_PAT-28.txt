Description: 
============

 Y2K Waiver ID#:  Y2KW0001               Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
 =>       This patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium, either
 BEFORE 12/15/99 or AFTER 1/15/2000.
 =>       This patch MAY NOT be installed between 12/15/1999 and 1/15/2000
 (the Y2K Lockdown Period).
  
  
 This patch addresses several Nois issues.
  
 DAN-1199-40031
 ==============
 Site was getting an undefined error when printing Beneficiary Report.
 Code has been fixed to eliminate undefined error.
  
 CIH-1099-41202
 ==============
 Beneficiary Report has confusing header - says report is for the primary
 integration site rather than for the name of the Integration group.  Now,
 if the site is integrated, the integration name will appear in the header.
 The api that returns the integrated name depends on the presence of the
 correct integrated name in the INTEGRATION NAME field (#17000) in the
 STATION NUMBER (TIME SENSITIVE) file (#389.9).
  
 ALT-1299-20682, CIH-0899-42594, PAL-1199-61498
 ===============================================
 Locks were set so that only one person could enter or edit Incident
 Report using option Brief Incident Edit [QAN INCIDENT REPORT] at one time.
 The lock has been corrected so that only the specific record is locked
 during an enter/edit session.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
 =================================================
  
 ALT-1299-20682, CIH-0899-42594, CIH-1099-41202, DAN-1199-40031 and
 PAL-1199-61498
  
 The display name of the option Brief Incident Edit [QAN INCIDENT REPORT]
 has been chenged to Brief Incident Enter/Edit to closer reflect the
 functionality. 
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other DHCP users will not be affected.
  
 Brief Incident Enter/Edit               [QAN INCIDENT REPORT]
 Beneficiary Report                      [QAN INCIDENT BENEFICIARY RPT]
 Full Incident Edit                      [QAN INCIDENT FOLLOW-UP]
