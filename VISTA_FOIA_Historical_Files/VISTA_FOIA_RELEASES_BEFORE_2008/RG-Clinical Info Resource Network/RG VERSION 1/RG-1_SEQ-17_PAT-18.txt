Subject: REMOVE REFERENCES TO EXTENSIBLE EDITOR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*13 is a required build for patch RG*1*18.
   
  1.  This patch eliminates all references to the Extensible Editor
  application by Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient
  Demographics and Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0.
   
  Integration Agreements 2793, 2794, and 2797 have been retired.
   
  By deleting routine RGHLEXC, all calls to Extensible Editor (RGED*)
  namespaced routines are removed.
   
  2.  The HL7 Exception Utility [RGHL EXCEPTION] option has been removed
  from the CIRN IRM Menu [RG IRM MENU] structure.  The removal of this
  obsolete option addresses NOIS number CLA-1100-20649.  Exceptions
  are resolved using the CIRN Exception Handling [RG CIRN EXCEPTION
  HANDLING] option.
   
  3.  Routine RGHLLOG1 has been edited to prevent stack overflow errors
  in test accounts.  This occurred when the MPIVA entry in the HL LOGICAL
  LINK (#870) file had no data in the DOMAIN (#.03) field.
