Description:
============

   **THE SUSPENSE PROTION OF THE USER MANUAL IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING 
 UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CHANGES IN THIS PATCH.  YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED AS 
 SOON AS IT IS FINISHED.
  
 The changes and enhancements are listed below:
  
 The main reason for this patch is to enhance the process for the 
 Prosthetics Purchasing Agents work with suspense records. The list manager
 screen from the options listed below has been modified. 
 1.  SP  Suspense Processing [RMPR SUSP MENU] 
 2.  PC  Purchase Card Form [RMPR4 PC]
  
 The following Protocols (actions) in the list manager screen have been
 removed because of limits in space.
  
  
 IA View Initial Action
 VO View Other Action  
 CO View Complete 
  
  
 Below are the added Protocols (actions) and a short explanation of their
 use. The title of the Action Edit Manual was changed to Edit Suspense 
 because the Prosthetics person can now edit Clone, Auto Adaptive, and 
 Clothing Allowance as well as Manual suspense.
  
 AA Auto Adaptive:
  
 When Prosthetics receives a request for Auto Adaptive Equipment they now 
 have the ability to create an Auto Adaptive Suspense.  This will count on 
 the CPRS Compliance Report as a CPRS type of suspense. 
  
 CC Clone CPRS:
  
 With Patch RMPR*3*80, we can now clone a CPRS consult.  This provides 
 PSAS with the ability to copy the original CPRS consult for an order 
 without requiring a new prescription to be made nor another physician 
 visit with the patient. 
  
 A Purchasing Agent will look for the original CPRS order for a requested 
 item, and copy the CPRS consult to create a new Suspense record saving 
 time for everyone in the process.
  
 CL Clothing Allowance:
  
 When Prosthetics receives a request for Clothing Allowance they now have 
 the ability to create a Clothing Allowance Suspense.  This will count on 
 the CPRS Compliance Report as a CPRS type of suspense.
  
 With the changes above the look of the list manager screen has changed as 
 shown below.
