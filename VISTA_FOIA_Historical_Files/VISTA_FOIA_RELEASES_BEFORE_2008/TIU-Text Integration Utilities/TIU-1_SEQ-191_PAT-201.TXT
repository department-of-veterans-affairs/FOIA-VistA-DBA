Subject: FIX MULTIPLE OBJECTS ON ONE LINE OF BOILERPLATE TEXT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The code that executes the TIU Note Boilerplates will either error or 
 return incorrect data in certain circumstances. The problems exist when 2 
 objects are placed in one boilerplate line where one or both of the
 objects returns a multiple value.
  
 Note: The TIU boilerplate code was not intended to handle multiple 
 objects returning multiple lines on one boilerplate line. In many cases 
 the result looks fine. In others the output may not be formatted 
 correctly. This patch only insures that the code will not error in the 
 above situation. It is still the end users responsibility to make sure 
 that the resulting note "looks" the way they want it to look.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 Problem:
 A progress note contained 2 objects on one boilerplate line. The second 
 object was a multiple. The boilerplate routine would error in this 
 situation.
  
  
 Solution:
 Improve the way the code parses the incoming result from the object so 
 that it can handle two objects on one line without erroring..
