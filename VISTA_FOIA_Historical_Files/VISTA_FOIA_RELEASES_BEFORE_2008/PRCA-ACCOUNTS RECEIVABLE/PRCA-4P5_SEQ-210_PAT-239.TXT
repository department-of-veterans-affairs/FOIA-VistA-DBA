Description:
============

 This patch changes the Bad Debt Reporting process.  Please be sure
 that your Revenue Office and Financial staff receive a copy of this 
 patch description.
  
  
 The Office of Business Oversight was asked to conduct a management
 review to determine whether the VistA Accounts Receivable (AR)
 application contributed to the conditions that required adjustments
 to be made to certain standard general ledger accounts for the Medical
 Care Collection Fund (36 5287).  In response to this request, the
 Software Quality Assurance Service conducted an audit and made several
 recommendations for changes to AR.  The Office of the Chief Financial
 Officer (CFO) concurs with the recommendations, which are implemented
 in this patch.
  
  
 Nearly all of the recommended changes involve the Bad Debt Report.  At
 a high level, the changes to the Bad Debt Report include:
  
    o  Modifying the transaction amount sent to the Financial Management
       System (FMS) to include only the current Allowance Estimate.
  
    o  Transmitting the Allowance Estimate on the third to the last
       business day of the month, along with the Summary Receivable
       Balance Standard Voucher (SV) and summary Write Off (WR)
       documents, without allowing these estimates to be modified
       by local accounting staff.
  
    o  Breaking out the Allowance Estimates for medication co-payment
       and all other third party (excluding Reimbursable Health
       Insurance and Tort Feasor) receivables.
  
  
 The specific changes that were made to AR follow:
  
 1. Accounts Receivable Data Collector
  
    The Accounts Receivable Data Collector (ARDC) is queued to run
    on the third to the last business day of the month by the 
    Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job (PRCA NIGHTLY
    PROCESS).  This job queues the ARDC to run under the TaskMan
    job description of 'AR Data Collector'.
  
    The following changes were made to the ARDC:
  
    a. Creation of Summary Receivable Balance SV Documents
  
       The patch resolves one problem with the generation of the 
       Summary Receivable Balance SV documents.  Currently, the
       receivable balance for any receivable (regardless of fund)
       that was activated after the site's Medicare Remittance
       Advice (MRA) Implementation Date is reported to Standard
       General Ledger (SGL) account 13H1 or 13N1 in FMS.  This
       patch corrects this problem by only reporting Reimbursable
       Health Insurance receivables activated after the site's
       MRA Implementation Date to SGL 13H1 or 13N1.
  
    b. Modification of the Bad Debt Transaction Amounts
  
       Currently, the actual Bad Debt transaction amount, for any
       subset of receivables, consists of the sum of the following
       two components:
   
         o  Actual Accrued Bad Debt:  This is the sum of all actual
            write-off (or contractual adjustment) transactions, for
            a specific subset of receivables, that have been
            recorded since February 1, 1998.
  
         o  Allowance Estimate:  The Allowance Estimate is equal to
            the Summary Receivable Balance for a specific subset of
            receivables, multiplied times the historical write-off
            percentage for that subset of receivables.  The write-
            off percentage is calculated by identifying all receivables
            within a subset that were activated within the last 12
            months and no longer have an outstanding balance, and
            dividing the total payments received by the total
            principal amount of those receivables, and subtracting
            that fraction from one.
  
       The Bad Debt transaction amount has been changed to be equal
       to the Allowance Estimate only.  The actual accrued bad debt
       component will no longer be transmitted to FMS.
  
    c. Breakout of the Allowance Estimate for Medication Co-payment
       and Other Third Party receivables
  
       Currently, a single transaction is used to report the Bad Debt
       amount for first party (excluding Long Term Care) and third
       party (excluding Reimbursable Health Insurance and Tort Feasor)
       receivables.  This amount is sent to FMS and reported to SGL
       1319 under fund 528703.  This transaction will be broken into
       three transactions to report a separate Allowance Estimate for
       Medication Co-payment (SC and NSC) receivables, under fund
       528701, and Other Third Party (Crimes of Personal Violence,
       Medicare, No Fault Auto, and Workman's Compensation) receivables,
       under fund 528704.  All three transaction amounts will be 
       reported to SGL 1319 under their respective funds.
  
    d. Transmission of the Allowance Estimate to FMS
  
       Currently, the Bad Debt Allowance is computed on the third
       to the last business day of the month and stored within AR.
       Staff have that business day to change the Allowance Estimate
       component, before the sum of the Allowance Estimate and actual
       accrued bad debt are transmitted to FMS on the second to the 
       last business day of the month.
  
       This functionality has been changed so that the Bad Debt
       Allowance (consisting only of the Allowance Estimate) will be
       transmitted to FMS on the third to the last business day
       of the month.  Local accounting staff will no longer be able
       to modify the Allowance Estimate before it is transmitted
       to FMS.
  
    e. Change in the Transaction Type for the summary Write Off (WR)
       documents
  
       The monthly summary WR documents for accrued receivables debit
       the same general ledger accounts that the Bad Debt Allowance
       Estimate transactions credit.  Since the Bad Debt Allowance
       Estimate transactions will be modified to no longer include
       the actual accrued bad debt from February 1998, the WR documents
       no longer need to debit the accounts that were credited by the
       allowance estimate transactions.  The crosswalk from the old
       to the new transaction type is:
  
       Old WR Transaction Type   New WR Transaction Type
       =======================   =======================
       WR 04                     WR 37
       WR 06                     WR 38
       WR 07                     WR 4N
       WR 23                     WR 39
  
       Please note that the WR 08 transaction, which is used to report
       contractual adjustments for actual MRA receivables (which should
       be infrequent), is not being replaced with a new transaction.
       Also, note that these new transaction types will be displayed on
       the AR Data Collector report that is transmitted to the
       recipients of the RC AR DATA COLLECTOR mailgroup.
   
 2. Bad Debt Report  (tasked job)
  
    The Bad Debt Report is queued to run on the second to the last
    business day of the month by the Accounts Receivable Nightly
    Process Background Job (PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS).  This job queues
    the Bad Debt Report to run under the TaskMan job description of
    'Bad Debt Report'.  The Bad Debt Report builds the SV documents
    and transmits them to FMS.
  
    The Bad Debt Report task will no longer be queued to run.  The ARDC
    will build the Bad Debt SV documents and transmit them to FMS after
    it calculates all of the Bad Debt Allowance Estimates.
  
 3. Bad Debt Accrual Over-Ride [PRCA NRNR BAD DEBT ACCR. EDIT]
  
    The option Bad Debt Accrual Over-Ride is used to modify the Bad
    Debt Allowance Estimate component for a specific bad debt 
    transaction.  The edited Allowance Estimate would be added to
    the actual accrued bad debt and transmitted to FMS.
  
    This option has been modified to no longer allow the user to
    modify the Allowance Estimates.  Upon selection by the user,
    the option displays the following message:
  
       This option will no longer allow you to over-ride the current
       month Bad Debt Allowance Estimates.  These estimates are
       automatically transmitted to FMS when they are calculated
       by the AR Data Collector on the third to the last business
       day of the month.
  
 4. Bad Debt Report [PRCA NR BAD DEBT ACCR. REPORT]
  
    The option Bad Debt Report, located under the Supervisor's
    AR Menu [PRCAF SUPERVISOR MENU], is used to print the Bad Debt
    Allowance Estimates that AR stores for one month.  The report
    layout has been re-designed to display a more concise summary
    that includes the two new Bad Debt Transactions and only the
    Allowance Estimate.  A mock-up of the new Bad Debt Report is
    shown below.

 Only members in the facility's local RC AR DATA COLLECTOR mail group
 will receive this report.
  
    Please note that this new version of the report will also be sent
    to the recipients of the RC AR DATA COLLECTOR mail group by the
    ARDC when it sends the Bad Debt SV documents to FMS on the third
    to the last business day of the month.
  
 5. Monthly NDB, SV and WR Regenerate [PRCA FMS NDB,SV,WR REGEN]
   
    The option Monthly NDB, SV and WR Regenerate [PRCA FMS NDB,SV,WR 
    REGEN]is used to re-run the ARDC for a specific month, and 
    re-transmit to FMS any documents for the selected month that have 
    not been identified in AR as having been positively acknowledged 
    by FMS.  On certain days within the monthly accounting cycle, this 
    option may recalculate the Bad Debt Allowance Estimates, but does 
    not re-transmit the Bad Debt SV documents to FMS.
  
    This option has been changed to both recalculate the Bad Debt
    Allowance Estimates and transmit them to FMS via the SV document.
    However, the option will prompt the user to perform this action
    only if the Bad Debt SV documents for the selected month have not
    been identified as accepted by FMS.
  
 6. Bad Debt Estimate Code Sheet Regen [PRCA FMS BDE REGEN]
  
    The option Bad Debt Estimate Code Sheet Regen [PRCA FMS BDE REGEN]
    is currently used to transmit the Bad Debt SV documents to FMS, if 
    the documents for the selected month have not been identified as 
    accepted by FMS.
  
    This option has been modified to no longer allow the user to
    re-transmit the Bad Debt SV documents to FMS, since that
    function will now be combined with the Bad Debt Allowance
    Estimate recalculation that is performed by the option
    Monthly NDB, SV and WR Regenerate [PRCA FMS NDB,SV,WR REGEN].  
    Upon selection by the user, the option Bad Debt Estimate Code 
    Sheet Regen [PRCA FMS BDE REGEN] now displays the following 
    message:
  
       This option may no longer be used to retransmit the Bad Debt
       allowance estimates to FMS.
  
       Please use the option 'Monthly NDB, SV and WR Regenerate' 
       [PRCA FMS NDB,SV,WR REGEN] to recalculate the allowance 
       estimates and transmit them to FMS.

 ================Documentation Retrieval =================
 
 The PRCA*4.5*239 documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at one of the Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
 
 The documentation provides the changed pages from the Accounts 
 Receivable User and Technical Manuals.  
 
 *These files should be downloaded in BINARY format.*
 
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
 
 1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit 
     the files from the first available FTP server.
 
 2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly 
     from a specific server as follows:
 
     Albany                    ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines                     ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov

 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: RCRJR
    Before: B19015855  After: B19437277  **101,103,78,153,191,239**
 Description of Changes:
  No longer queues the job to transmit to FMS the Bad Debt SV
  documents on the second to the last business day of the month. 

Routine Name: RCRJRBD
    Before: B65206172  After: B64259374  **101,139,170,193,203,215,220,
                                          138,239**
 Description of Changes:
  Includes a new API to calculate the standard general ledger account
  for a receivable.
  Invokes the new SGL API when calculating actual bad debt and
  collecting total principal and payment amounts.
  Files Bad Debt data for the new SGLs 1319.3 (fund 528701) and
  1319.4 (fund 528704).
  Routine no longer generates the Bad Debt Report that is sent to users
  via MailMan.
  Routine now invokes RCXFMSSV to transmit the Bad Debt SV documents to FMS.

Routine Name: RCRJRBDE
    Before: B12066139  After: B14335641  **101,191,184,239**
 Description of Changes:
  Routine no longer allows the edit of the Bad Debt allowance estimates.
  The routine displays a message on the screen informing users that
  the over-ride option no longer allows user edit, and that the
  allowance estimates are automatically sent to FMS.

Routine Name: RCRJRBDR
    Before: B73367814  After: B75826184  **101,139,170,191,203,215,220,
                                          138,239**

 Description of Changes:
  Routine no longer allows the user to re-transmit the Bad Debt SV
  documents to FMS.  The routine displays a message on the screen
  informing users that another option must be used to re-transmit
  the documents.
  The routine comments out certain lines of code (that calls routine
  RCXFMSSV) to assure that it cannot be invoked.
  A new module is added (invoked by RCRJRBDR) that generates the new
  Bad Debt Report.

Routine Name: RCRJRCO
    Before: B60587667  After: B61342220  **96,106,101,103,147,156,169,
                                          170,174,191,203,239**

    Before: B59061042  After: B56544530  **156,170,182,203,220,138,239**
 Description of Changes:
  Under line tag CURRENT:
    The SV document type is only set to 2F or 2L for Reimbursable
    Health Insurance bills.
    The new SGL API in RCRJRBD is invoked to set the receivable's
    SGL to capture outstanding balances for Bad Debt Report processing.

    The following new document types were implemented:  37 (replaces 04),
    39 (replaces 23), 38 (replaces 06), and 4N (replaces 07).

Routine Name: RCRJRCOR
    Before: B67310039  After: B67290990  **68,96,139,103,156,170,174,191,
                                          220,138,239**
 Description of Changes:
  Modified to continue to print sub-totals on the ARDC report for
  the WR 37 transaction by fund.

Routine Name: RCXFMSSV
    Before: B54145302  After: B57335503  **96,101,135,139,98,156,170,191,
                                          203,220,138,184,239**
 Description of Changes:
  In STARTSV, modified the call to BUILDSV to pass the new fourth
  parameter ("00") which is the document lookup key suffix.
  Changed line tag BUILDSV to accept the new fourth parameter.
  In BUILDSV, changed the call to SETKEY^GECSSTAA to build the
  lookup key using the "key suffix" parameter.
  Introduced variable FMAMOUNT as the positive amount that is
  sent to FMS.
  Made code change to set LINE-ACTION to "D" if AMOUNT is
  less than zero.
  Changed setting of DOCTOTAL so that value is not negative.
  Changed line tag BADDEBT to accept the date of the last day
  of the accounting month from routine RCRJRBD.
  This module no longer News tha variable RCRJDATE.
  The module BADDEBT now extracts two new records (1319.3 and 1319.4)
  from file 348.1 and sets the TMP global so the data from these
  records are sent to FMS in the Bad Debt SV document.
  The bad debt allowance amount that is sent to FMS for all seven records
  now consists of only the allowance estimate (field .08 in file 348.1).
