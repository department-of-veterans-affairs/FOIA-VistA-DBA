Description:
============

 This patch is an enhancement to the Surgery software providing additional 
 changes related to Ensuring Correct Surgery. This patch is Phase I of the 
 enhancement.
  
 This patch exports the following new fields in the SURGERY file (#130):
  - The MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#73) will have three choices:
    "Y, YES", "M, MARKING NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCEDURE" and "N, NO -
    MARKING REQUIRED BUT NOT DONE (see CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS)".
  - The CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#74) which is a word processing 
    type field.
  
 This patch modifies the following four existing fields in the SURGERY 
 file (#130):
  - A minor change is made to the description of the "NO" choice in 
    the TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71).
  
  - The PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72) will have three 
    choices: "Y, YES", "I, IMAGING NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCEDURE" and
    "N, NO - IMAGING REQUIRED BUT NOT VIEWED (see CORRECT SURGERY
    COMMENTS)"
  
  - The description of the different choices of the ATTENDING CODE 
    field (#.165) is modified.
  
  - The maximum number of years of surgical residency (post graduate)
    of the PGY OF PRIMARY SURGEON field (#214) is changed from 10 to 12. 
  
 This patch also exports the following new date/time fields that will be 
 used to time-stamp when the three correct Surgery fields (TIME OUT 
 VERIFIED (#71), PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED (#72), and MARKED SITE 
 CONFIRMED (#73)) of the SURGERY file (#130) are entered or edited, and
 they are not editable fields:
  - TOV TIMESTAMP field (#75)
  - IMAG TIMESTAMP field (#76)
  - SITE MARK TIMESTAMP field (#77)
  
 These fields MARKED SITE CONFIRMED (#73), PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED 
 (#72), and CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS (#74) are found under the following
 menu options:
  - Operation [SROMEN-OP] option
  - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT] option
  - Operation Startup [SROMEN-START] option
  
 This patch will disable the Ensuring Correct Surgery Compliance Report 
 [SRO ECS COMPLIANCE] option. Also, the compliance section of the 
 Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] option will be 
 disabled until Correct Surgery Enhancements 2004 Phase II is released, 
 targeted date is June 2004.

         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*126.
