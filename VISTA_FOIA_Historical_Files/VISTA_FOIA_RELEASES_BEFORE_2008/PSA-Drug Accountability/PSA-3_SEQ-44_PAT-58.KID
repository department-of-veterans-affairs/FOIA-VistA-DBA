This patch addresses the following problems:
"BLD",6577,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",6577,1,3,0)
1. HD 67762 PSANDF 12 digit NDC
"BLD",6577,1,4,0)
The emerging standard is becoming 11 digits for the National Drug Code 
"BLD",6577,1,5,0)
(NDC). The code had previously been set to create/require 12 digits by 
"BLD",6577,1,6,0)
adding leading zeros. It is now set to create/require 11 digit NDCs. 
"BLD",6577,1,7,0)
 
"BLD",6577,1,8,0)
2. HD 68340 Forced selection of unique drug names.
"BLD",6577,1,9,0)
The software is completing the selection of a unique drug name without 
"BLD",6577,1,10,0)
giving the user the chance to verify the selection. The drug name is 
"BLD",6577,1,11,0)
unique and the few characters input by the user is enough to select the 
"BLD",6577,1,12,0)
drug. Once the drug is selected it is not easy to navigate the software 
"BLD",6577,1,13,0)
to a place where the drug can be reselected if the selection completed by 
"BLD",6577,1,14,0)
the software is not what the user wanted.
