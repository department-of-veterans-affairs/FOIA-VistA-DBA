Description:
============

 The Department of the Treasury has directed all federal agencies to
 Accelerate SF 224 (Statement of Transactions), and other external
 reporting at the End of the Accounting Month (EOAM). To comply with these
 external reporting changes, VA's Financial Management System (FMS) EOAM
 processing cycle will be changed so that the workday overlap will be
 eliminated. This requires changes in the schedules for producing
 interfacing files that are needed in FMS at the end of the month to
 provide for accurate and timely EOAM financial reporting. Beginning with
 September 2003, EOAM will be processed the last workday of the calendar
 month and all interfacing EOAM files must be received at the Austin
 Automation Center (AAC) by 8 PM (CT) on the last workday of the month.
  
 To accomplish this, it has been determined that VA medical facilities will
 have to cut off their monthly processing 3 workdays from the end of the
 month. This will allow them the time they need to generate data and
 reports, as well as reconcile the data, in order to meet the submission
 deadline. This cutoff only affects the VistA Accounts Receivable (AR)
 application package. Any AR processing that occurs after the cutoff date
 will be held up within VistA and not sent to the AAC until the first day
 of the following month. This is necessary to allow medical centers to
 close their monthly processes. The accounting month in AR will now
 encompass the last three workdays of the previous month, and up 
 to the last three workdays of the current month.
  
 This patch includes the changes to the functionality that allows all new
 documents created after the end of the accounting month, to be held for
 transmission to FMS until the first of the next month.  The system will
 check today's date with the end of the month date and set the date for
 transmission to FMS. If the document has been previously transmitted and
 rejected in FMS, and is after the EOAM date, the system will override the
 date of the first of the next month, and transmit the document with a date
 of today. This will take place at a system level and be invisible to the
 user.  Also, when a document is created and is being set up for
 transmission, two new fields,  FMS TRANSMISSION DATE (#266) field in 
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file, and FMS TRANSMISSION DATE (#2) field in
 AR FMS DOCUMENT (#347) file, will be updated with the date of transmission
 to FMS.
  
 The following routines have been changed to accommodate this
 functionality:
  
 PRCACPV
 PRCAFBD
 PRCAFBDM
 PRCAFBDU
 PRCAFWO
 RCBEUTRA
 RCBEADJ
 RCDPURE1
 RCFMFN02
 RCXFMSCR

 File changes included in this patch are as follows:
 A new field has been added to these files.
  
       File ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) 
       field FMS TRANSMISSION DATE (#266)
           This field has been made uneditable through FileMan but will be
           editable through the system processes.
  
       File AR FMS DOCUMENTS (#347) 
       field FMS TRANSMISSION DATE (#2)
           This field has been made uneditable through FileMan but will be
           editable through the system processes.
