Subject: MODIFICATIONS TO CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT RULES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 In support of the anticipated deployment of Enrollment System Redesign 
 (ESR), the Continuous  Enrollment (CE) software enhancement formalizes a 
 list of rules used to determine whether a veteran  will be continuously 
 enrolled for VA health care. Continuous enrollment applies only to those 
 veterans  who applied for enrollment after January 16, 2003 and were at 
 some point eligible for enrollment but whose eligibility status may have 
 changed, such as when a veteran's VA Pension benefit is terminated.  
 VistA will invoke CE rules when the veteran is assigned a base priority 
 group (PG) that is greater than  the enrollment group threshold (EGT) and 
 if the EGT setting is Enrollment Decision. Currently, the  EGT is set at 
 PG 8. Therefore, when a record is determined to be PG 8, VistA will 
 invoke the CE rules to determine the appropriate subpriority  group.
  
 These rules have been built into the VistA software and are based on VA 
 policy and regulation. While  VHA staff remain responsible for entering 
 data into VistA, the VistA system will apply the Continuous Enrollment 
 rules to those records staff enter.  CE rules that were in place prior to 
 this patch will no longer apply.  The following rules will be implemented 
 for continuous enrollment:
  
 To determine a veteran's current enrollment record for the purpose of 
 continuous enrollment, ignore any records with an enrollment status in 
 the following list and look to the most recent record that is not in one 
 of these statuses:
  
    *    Pending Means Test Required
    *    Pending Purple Heart Unconfirmed 
    *    Pending Eligibility Status Unverified 
    *    Pending Other 
    *    Pending No Eligibility Code 
    *    Deceased
    *    Not Eligible; Ineligible Date
    *    Not Eligible; Refused to Pay Copay 
  
 Once the current enrollment record has been determined, the following 
 rules will be executed in this order: 
  
 1.  If the enrollment record is in a REJECTED enrollment status due 
 to a manual override [at the HEC] (i.e., Enrollment Status Override 
 =YES), it will remain in a REJECTED status unless the veteran is assigned 
 to an enrollment priority group that is being enrolled, 
       OR
 Until a new EGT is set that could qualify the veteran for enrollment 
       OR
 The record in a REJECTED enrollment status is manually overridden [at the 
 HEC] to ENROLLED
  
 2.  If the enrollment record is in a REJECTED enrollment status, it 
 will stay REJECTED as long as the veteran stays in an enrollment priority 
 group that is not being accepted for new enrollment. 
  
 3.  If the enrollment record is in a VERIFIED enrollment status due to a
 manual override [at the HEC] (i.e., Enrollment Status Override =YES), the
 veteran will remain ENROLLED until a new EGT is set that could disqualify
 the veteran from enrollment
        OR
 The record in an ENROLLED category is manually overridden [at the HEC] to
 a REJECTED enrollment status
  
 4.  If the enrollment record is in a CANCEL/DECLINED enrollment 
 status on or after the EGT Effective Date, it will be treated the same as 
 a record in a REJECTED enrollment status. The veteran will not be 
 continuously enrolled as long as s/he stays in an enrollment priority 
 group that is not being accepted for new enrollments. 
  
 5.  If the current enrollment record does not meet any of the 
 conditions in Rules 1-4 above, the veteran's enrollment records will be 
 evaluated from most current to earliest, with the following rules applied 
 in this order:
  
     *   If the earliest Effective Date of Change is prior to the EGT 
 Effective Date, the veteran will be continuously enrolled.
     *   If there is any application date prior to the EGT Effective Date, 
 the veteran will be continuously enrolled.
  
 6.  If the veteran has ever had a verified enrollment record with an 
 eligibility in the following list, s/he will be continuously enrolled: 
  
     *   SC 10% or greater 
            AND
         SC% is changed to SC 0% non compensable (total check amount $0 or
         null)
  
     *   Aid & Attendance = YES 
            AND
         A&A is now not YES
  
     *   Housebound = YES 
            AND
         Housebound is now not YES
  
     *   VA Pension = YES 
            AND
         VA Pension is now not YES
  
     *   AO indicator = YES 
            AND
         Location = DMZ was entered prior to Enrollment System Redesign V.
         3.0 (ESR) implementation. (The date that will be used is
         12/29/2040 until ESR is implemented. The date will be changed to
         the ESR implementation date by a subsequent patch).
  
     *   The CV End Date expires on or after the Enrollment Application 
         Date (or, in the absence of an Application Date, the earliest
         Effective Date of Change)
            AND
         The CV End Date has not been removed
  
     *   The veteran is enrolled due to a Means Test that qualifies for 
         enrollment,  
            AND
         A subsequent income year Means Test was added or edited that would
         place the veteran in a priority group that is not being enrolled
         UNLESS:
         
         The Means Test on the first verified enrollment record is
         edited to a Means Test Status that places the record in a priority
         group not being enrolled and veteran has no subsequent record
         that would quality for enrollment,
            OR
         The Means Test on the first verified enrollment record is
         converted by IVM to a Means Test Status that places the record in
         a priority group not being enrolled and veteran has no subsequent
         record that would quality for enrollment.
  
  
 7.  If the enrollment record history does not support any of Rules 1-6
 above,
       AND
 The base priority is numerically greater than the EGT threshold,
       THEN
 The decision is to REJECT enrollment.
  
   
 The rules are complicated, but the overarching premise is that if a 
 veteran's enrollment was based on valid eligibility factors and these 
 factors have changed over time as a normal course and the veteran now 
 qualifies for PG 8, the veteran will be placed in PG 8a or 8c and remain 
 enrolled. However, if the veteran was  enrolled based on one or more 
 factors that were later found to be erroneous, the veteran would be 
 placed  in PG 8e or 8g and the veteran's enrollment discontinued. The 
 following examples illustrate the continuous enrollment rules:
  
 *   Veteran Alpha is a NSC, MT Copay Required Combat Veteran. He enrolled
 on January 15, 2005, in PG  6 with a June 1, 2006 Combat Veteran End Date.
 On June 2, Veteran Alpha's Combat Veteran  Eligibility expires. The 
 continuous enrollment rules are invoked and he is changed to PG 8c.
  
 *  Veteran Bravo is 10 percent SC and is enrolled in PG 3. VBA readjusts
 his award down to zero percent  SC and veteran completes a MT and is MT
 Copay Required. The continuous enrollment rules are  invoked and Veteran
 Bravo is changed to Priority Group 8a.
  
 *  NSC Veteran Charlie applies for enrollment on June 10, 2003, and is 
 placed in PG 5 based on MT  Copay Exempt status. IVM confirms the MT 
 Copay Exempt status is appropriate. The veteran  completes a new MT for 
 the following income year and is placed in a MT Copay Required status. 
 The continuous enrollment rules are invoked and Veteran Charlie is 
 changed to PG 8c and remains enrolled.
  
 *  NSC Veteran Delta applies for enrollment on March 15, 2003, and is
 placed in PG 5, based on MT  Copay Exempt status. Her subsequent means
 tests place her in a MT Copay Required status. When the test that
 qualified Veteran Delta for enrollment is converted to a MT Copay Required
 Status by IVM, Veteran Delta is placed in PG 8e and her enrollment is
 discontinued.
  
 *  Veteran Echo is enrolled as a 10 percent SC veteran and is placed in PG
 3. HEC later confirms that the veteran has no service-connected 
 disabilities and corrects the record. The veteran is placed in PG 8g and 
 his enrollment is discontinued.
  
 *  Veteran Foxtrot is a zero percent SC noncompensable, MT Copay Required 
 veteran who was enrolled in PG 6 based on an assertion of Agent Orange 
 Exposure while in service in Vietnam. He is subsequently found not to 
 have served in Vietnam and the Agent Orange Exposure indicator is changed 
 to No. As a result, Veteran Foxtrot's priority is reassessed and he is 
 placed in PG 8e.
  
 Currently, HEC staff may manually override any enrollment determination 
 either to reject or continuously enroll a veteran, regardless of any 
 business rule. This capability will not change with the CE software 
 enhancement.
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 ========================
 Augusta, GA
 El Paso, TX
  
 NOTE:  This patch received an exemption from production testing.  This 
 was necessary because, if a veteran's information is changed at the test 
 site, it will be shared with all sites of record via the HEC.  If a 
 shared site of record is not running the test software, the veteran's 
 information may not be properly updated, possibly creating serious data 
 inconsistencies that could affect patient benefits and care.
