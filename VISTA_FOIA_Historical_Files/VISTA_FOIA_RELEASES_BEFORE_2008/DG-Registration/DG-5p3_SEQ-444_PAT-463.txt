Description: 
============

 The patch addresses the following NOIS issues:
       CMS-1102-31110:    Means Test not in DHCP
  
 Patch Description:
 ==================
  
 The consistency checks that are performed during the data entry of an 
 Income Test display informational only inconsistency messages.  Because 
 these messages are not stored, they cannot be easily identified for 
 correction purposes.  The user is able to complete the test without 
 correcting the inconsistent data, and no further inconsistency messages 
 are available.
  
 When an Income Test is added, edited or completed the Income Test data 
 will be validated using the current consistency checks that are performed 
 during an upload of an INCOME TEST DATA (Z10) Transmission.  The process 
 of entering and completing either a MEANS TEST or a CO-PAY TEST will not 
 be changed. 
  
 The following menu options will be modified to validate the Income Test 
 information using the current consistency checks.  
  
     [DG MEANS TEST USER MENU]   Means Test User Menu
     [DG MEANS TEST ADD]         Add a New Means Test
     [DG MEANS TEST COMPLETE]    Complete a Required Means Test
     [DG MEANS TEST EDIT]        Edit an Existing Means Test
  
     [DG CO-PAY TEST USER MENU]  Copay Exemption Test User Menu
     [DG CO-PAY TEST ADD]        Add a Copay Exemption Test
     [DG CO-PAY TEST EDIT]       Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test
  
 Any data inconsistencies that are identified by the consistency checks 
 will be stored in the COMMENT sub-file (#408.311) in the ANNUAL MEANS 
 TEST File (#408.31).  The ANNUAL MEANS TEST record will be updated with a 
 message containing the following information: 
  
     1. There were inconsistencies in the data
     2. When the test was last edited
     3. A complete list of the data inconsistencies
  
 Any existing comments in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST record will be appended 
 with the inconsistency messages.  Each subsequent time the record is 
 edited, the inconsistency messages will be removed, and the data will be 
 re-checked.  Then a new message will be processed, and applied to the 
 record.  Any inconsistencies that remain after editing will be reflected 
 in the new message.
  
 A new Mail Group has been created to receive the bulletin when an Income 
 Test has been completed with data inconsistencies.  The MT 
 INCONSISTENCIES bulletin will be sent to the MT INCONSISTENCIES mail 
 group and to the user completing the Income test.  The subject of the 
 bulletin will also contain the first letter of the veteran's last name 
 and the last four digits of the Social Security Number.

     From: MULLER,RICHARD  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     An Income Test was edited/completed on Jan 24, 2003
     containing 4 data inconsistencies.
  
         NAME:        CURRO,MICHAEL
         ID:          ***********
         TEST DATE:   Sep 24, 1999
  
     The inconsistencies are listed in the comment section of
     the income test for this veteran.
  
     Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//
  
 The MT INCONSISTENCIES Bulletin will only be received at the site where 
 the test was completed.  The upload of the ORU~Z10 and ORF~Z10 messages 
 from the HEC will not cause the bulletin to be sent.
  
 Note: This patch (DG*5.3*463) includes a post install, which 
 automatically adds the user who is installing the patch to 
 the MT INCONSISTENCIES Mail Group.
