Subject: KERNEL on OpenM-NT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  For ALPHA/NT OpenM/Cache sites, these routines were included in
  the KRN_ONT_34.RTN file(s) that were used as part of the conversion
  process to OpenM/Cache. This file went through several revisions 
  during the course of the project so depending on when a site
  converted, the old checksums for these routines may vary from what
  this patch indicates.  Avaliable Jobs and Act Jobs adjusted to work
  with both OpenM (NextGen Build52e) and Cache.
  
  This patch is only needed by OpenM sites, Installing at other sites
  will not cause any problems.
