Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the problem with Release not Verified status being 
 available for those procedures where Released Not Verified status has been 
 turned off.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 
 PHO-0103-62166  Release Not Verified always selectable as status
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently, the Release Not Verified (RNV) status is always selectable when 
 verifying reports in the Medicine package.  The function of the RNV STATUS ON 
 field (#14) in the PROCEDURE/SUBSPECIALTY file (#697.2) is to act as a 
 switch to turn on/off the use of RNV for a procedure.  Setting this field 
 to "NO" does not remove the RNV status from the selections.   
 
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 A defect was found in routine ^MCESEDT.  The RNV STATUS ON parameter was 
 being hardset to "YES" in the code, ignoring its value in file #697.2. 
 
 ^MCESEDT +9
  
 S RNV=+$P($G(^MCAR(697.2,MCARGNUM,0)),U,17),RNV=1  <=== set to 1 regardless
                                                         of value in 697.2
 
 ",RNV=1" was removed from the end of this line of code.

 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 
 A change was made to the Description for the RNV STATUS ON field (#14) in the 
 PROCEDURE/SUBSPECIALTY file (#697.2).
 
 Before:
 -------
 This field allow the managers to remove Release Not Verfied as a Status.
 If the Manager answer yes to RNV Status ON the key holders can select
 Release Not Verified.  If the Manager answer no to RNV status ON the key
 holders can on select a verified status and must sign off on it.
 
 After:
 ------
 This field allows the manager(s) to remove Release Not Verified as a
 Status.  If the Manager answers "Yes" to RNV STATUS ON for a particular 
 Procedure/Subspecialty, then users with the subspecialty provider key       
 can select Release Not Verified.  If the Manager answers "No" to RNV STATUS
 ON, the key holder can only select a verified status and must sign off on   
 it.
