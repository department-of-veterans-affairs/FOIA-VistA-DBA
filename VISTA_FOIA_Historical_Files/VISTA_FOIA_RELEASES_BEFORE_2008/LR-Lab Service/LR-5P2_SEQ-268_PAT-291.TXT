Description:
============

 This patch is the Laboratory part of Clinical Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) 
 project. There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated with this patch.  
  
 Required:  
 =========
   
 Before installing patch LR*5.2*291, site IRM personnel are directed to
 coordinate with the site's Laboratory Automated Data Processing Application
 Coordinator (ADPAC) or Laboratory Information Manager (LIM).
  
 With the install of LR*5.2*291 the RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL(#.1) field of the
 ACCESSION (#68) file is changed from a free text field to a pointer to 
 the NEW PERSON (#200) file. This new field when populated will be 
 utilized to specify the rendering provider of the PCE workload rather than
 the PCE DEFAULT PROVIDER (#617)field of the LABORATORY SITE(#69.9)file as
 is currently the case. This allows sites to specify down to the Accession
 Area level for PCE encounter data.
  
 To assist sites with populating this field, an Environment Check LR291 
 routine will loop through each Accession Area prompting the installer to 
 specify the Responsible Official. During the process the software 
 displays the current 'OLD' free text value and does a look up on the New 
 Person (#200) file based on the free text and valid active person 
 class entries. If the routine finds more than one potential match the 
 installer is presented a list of all matching entries to select one. 
 Since the field is optional the installer may not answer these additional 
 prompts were no Responsible Official specified. The Environment Check 
 routine stops and the installer is able to continue the installation. 
 Laboratory personal are able to review and update the Accession Area 
 RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL at a later time.
  
 IRM should consult with the site Laboratory ADPAC or Laboratory LIM for 
 names of RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS to specify.
  
 EXAMPLE:
         ACCESSION AREA: CHEMISTRY
                 Old Responsible Official:       XXXXX, XXX X
                 New Responsible Official:       YYYYY, YYY Y
                 Chief, Pathology & Laboratory
  
 It is crucial that the Laboratory ADPAC or LIM be available immediately
 after the installation of this patch to flag billable lab panels to
 prevent them from unbundling.  Should billable panels unbundle, a large
 amount of otherwise unnecessary work will be required because of the high
 volume of certain billable panels. The medical coders will be required to
 identify large numbers of individual unbundled tests, recognize them as
 billable panels, and then manually rebundle them for billing.
  
 A list of billable panels for reference can be found on the CIDC Website 
 at

  Overview
 ========
  
 BACKGROUND: The Laboratory Clinical Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) project is
 part of the larger CIDC project under Management Systems service line. The 
 VistA Laboratory application is one of several clinical applications  
 requiringmodifications to meet the necessary data capture requirements for
 CIDC.
  
 HIGHLIGHTS: There will be additional calls created to applications outside
 the Laboratory package (primarily PCE) to retrieve or store data, but most
 of these changes occur in the background and will not directly impact the
 user.
   
 This phase of the development effort requires passing of collected CIDC data
 elements to PCE for patients with an outpatient status.  Due to the addition
 of several new fields, primarily associated with the internal order process,
 once this release is installed the user will see additional data entry
 fields.
  
 BENEFITS AND GOALS:  The primary goal of this release is to capture CIDC 
 information within the Laboratory application to store the clinical reason
 and any indications associated with the reason for the lab test rendered.
  
 Functional Description 
 ======================
  
 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BACK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Patch LR*5.2*291 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Patch LR*5.2*291 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS:Changes made by patch LR*5.2*291 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
 ====================================================
  
 The following identifies the modifications to the VistA Laboratory 
 software.  An attempt is made to identify those changes that may require 
 involvement of the end-user (laboratory staff), as opposed to software 
 processes that will occur in response to current data entry (or data entry
 from external applications such as CPRS).
   
   1.  Service Connected Indicator* - This is a data element that 
         currently exists but is not currently used by the Laboratory 
         application.  This data element is available from an outside source 
         such as CPRS.  In the case of internal Lab order entry, there will 
         be additional fields displayed during specimen receipt.
   
   2.  Environmental Indicator* - This is a data element that currently  
         exists but is not currently used by the Laboratory application.   
         It is available from an outside source such as CPRS.  In the case
         of internal Lab order entry, there will be additional fields  
         displayed during specimen receipt.
  
   3.  Changes to Existing Orders - This involves capturing CIDC information 
         when a test is an add-on, reflex, or deleted. The CIDC information 
         will be sent to CPRS and PCE.
  
   4.  CPT association - The Laboratory system currently unbundles service 
         requests to a level that allows result reporting.  The software 
         will store procedures (CPT codes) at the reportable level for 
         transmission to PCE at the time of result release.
    
   5.  CPT Coding - The Laboratory application currently allows tests 
         (individual or panels) to link to CPT codes via NLT.  The current 
         system was designed for workload capture and may not be suitable 
         for proper clinical indicator data capture purposes.  Modifications
         to the association of test to procedure code will be handled in the 
         background.
   
   6.  Coded Diagnosis* - This is a data element that currently exists but
         is not currently used by the Laboratory application.  For clinical 
         laboratory and microbiology, this information will be made available 
         from an outside source such as CPRS.  Additional fields will be 
         presented to accommodate entry of one or more diagnoses in ICD-9 
         format in the case of internal Lab order entry accessioning.
    
   7.  External Services - Laboratory service requests, which are performed 
         at an external location, will be identified.  These send-outs will 
         be identified with the use of CPT modifiers.
   
   8.  Date sent to PCE  - This involves capturing all billing information
         and sending to PCE. The software will identify the information
         needed to be sent to PCE.
   
   9.  Rendering Physician Name - This data element represents the individual 
         responsible for result reporting.  The application may require a  
         data input field to allow identification of the reporting individual 
         responsible for resulting or result interpretation.
   
  10.  CPRS Alerts - This function alerts the ordering provider in CPRS that
         an order may be missing associated diagnosis, SC/EI information
         or require an electronic signature.
     
  * NOTE: These prompts will only be available, whether from an outside
          source such as CPRS or the internal lab order entry, if the user
          user has the PROVIDER key and the CIDC switch and the patient's
          insurance permit these prompts to appear.
   
  Further information is provided in the supporting documentation.  
  
 Technical Description 
 ======================
 The routines LR7OB3, LR7OB69, LR7OF0, LR7OF1 are modified to parse the DG1
   and ZCL segments being sent from CPRS. The data is stored in the LAB 
   ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69) file.  
  
 The routines LRFAST, LRORD, LRORDST, LROW, LROW2A are modified to prompt
   the provider (or holder of the PROVIDER key) with the diagnosis question.
   The Service Connected and Environmental Indicators (SC/EI) questions
   will also be asked. The data is stored in the LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69)
   file.  
   
 The routines LRTSTJAM and LRTSTSET are modified to allow proper association
   of diagnosis and SC/EI for tests added to accessions.
   
 The routines LRVER1, LRVER3, LRVR1, LRVR3 are modified to collect the CIDC 
   information stored in the LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69) file. The data is 
   sent to PCE and CPRS.  
    
 The routine LRNIGHT is modified to check the need to send unbundled
   AMA/Billable panels to PCE on the Panel Process Date in the LABORATORY 
   SITE (#69.9) file.
   
 The routine LRCAPPH3 is modified to send a new report to the LMI Mail
   Group during nightly Lab cleanup.  This new report identifies entries 
   in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file that are associated with inactive CPT
   Codes.
   
 The routines LRBEBA, LRBEBA2, LRBEBA3, LRBEBA31, LRBEBA4, LRBEBAO are a 
   collection of APIs that handle all the collection and distribution of 
   CIDC information.  The APIs are called by the order entry and resulting
   routines.
   
 The routine LRBEBA5 is called by the nightly cleanup task to check the
   Panel Process Date, and to unbundle AMA/Billable panels as needed.
  
 The routine LRBEPEND provides a new report on the Lab liaison menu that
   lists AMA/Billable panels from the preceding calendar month that are 
   still pending completion.  It is used by the Print AMA CPT Panel Pending 
   List [LRBE PENDREP] menu option.
  
   
  ***************************** IMPORTANT *********************************
   
  AMA/Billable Panels
  -------------------
  
  After install of LR*5.2*291 all Lab panels will be sent to PCE 'unbundled' 
  as their individual atomic tests.  It is important that each site review 
  their Lab panels for proper coding, identify their AMA/Billable panels for
  billing, and mark them as such in the new field AMA COMPLIANT/BILLABLE 
  PANEL (#508) of the LABORATORY TEST file (#60).  A valid CPT or HCPCS
  Code must be associated with the AMA/Billable panel test in order to
  send a panel-level (i.e., 'bundled') CPT code to PCE for billing.  
   
  Sites will use the new option Test/Specimen/CPT Link [LRED CPT] to flag 
  their AMA/Billable panels.  This option is not included in the Laboratory
  DHCP Menu [LRMENU]. It must be added to the secondary menu in the NEW 
  PERSON (#200) file of the user that will be entering panel CPT codes for 
  Laboratory.
   
  To assist in review of proper CPT coding, the new menu option Lab Tests
  and CPT Report [LRBE PANEL CPT REPORT] provides a report of Lab tests
  and their associated CPT codes.  This new report option is located in the
  Lab Liaison menu [LRLIAISON].
   
  CPT codes for panel tests flagged as AMA/Billable are not sent to PCE
  until all 'required' atomic tests within the panel have been verified.
  Once all required atomic tests are verified, the 'bundled' CPT code is
  sent to PCE (i.e., the CPT or HCPCS Code associated with the AMA/Billable
  panel).  If any required atomic test is cancelled during verification,
  then the remaining tests on the panel will be unbundled as they are
  verified.  In that case, PCE will receive a CPT code for each individual
  atomic test.
   
  Marking a required atomic test on an AMA/Billable panel as 'Not
  Performed' by deleting the atomic test from the accession after result
  verification also causes the panel to be unbundled.  But since data
  only passes to PCE upon verification, the accession would need to be
  re-verified in order for the unbundling to occur immediately.  This may
  happen whenever it is necessary to change a previously verified result,
  verify a new result for another test in the accession, or add a comment.
  If there is no reason to re-verify the accession, then the unbundled CPT
  Codes will not pass to PCE until the date specified in the PANEL PROCESS
  DATE field (#620) of the LABORATORY SITE PARAMETERS file (#69.9).
  
  As stated above, a valid CPT or HCPCS Code must be associated with the 
  AMA/Billable panel.  If this requirement is not satisfied, the panel is 
  not sent to PCE even though all required component tests have been 
  verified.  Again, the transmission to PCE will be delayed until the date
  specified in the PANEL PROCESS DATE field (#620).
   
  Pending AMA/Billable Panels to PCE
  ----------------------------------
  
  The PANEL PROCESS DATE field (#620) in file #69.9 should be set after
  consultation with HIMS personnel at your site.  This field should be set
  to a date preceding the date of PCE's monthly data roll-up to the Austin 
  Automation Center.  Typically, the PANEL PROCESS DATE is set to at least
  one day, but no more than 5 days, before the PCE roll-up date.
   
  Each night when the scheduled Nightly Cleanup [LRTASK NIGHTY] task runs,
  the date in field #620 of file #69.9 is checked.  If that date is equal
  to or less than the current date, then the roll-up of pending AMA/Billable
  panels is started.  Pending AMA/Billable panels from the prior month, not
  previously sent to PCE because either (1) not all required atomic tests
  were verified or (2) the panel did not have a valid CPT/HCPCS Code, will
  be sent to PCE at this time.  If all required atomic tests are still not
  verified or if a valid CPT/HCPCS Code for the panel is still not present,
  then the panel will be unbundled and PCE will receive a CPT code for each
  verified atomic test.  A report is sent via MailMan to the LMI Mail Group
  with details of the pending AMA/Billable panel roll-up to PCE.  The
  Subject header of the message is "Report on Roll-up to PCE for <current
  date>".
   
  The PANEL PROCESS DATE must be set initially via the FileMan Enter/Edit
  option.  Each month when the roll-up of AMA/Billable panels occurs, this
  date is automatically re-set for the next month.
   
  Example:
   
  The site's PCE Roll-up to AAC occurs on the 19th of each month.  If the
  site installs LR*5.2*291 in May, 2006, they could then set the PANEL
  PROCESS DATE field to June 17, 2006.  On June 17 the Nightly Cleanup will
  start the roll-up of pending AMA/Billable panels to PCE.  Only panels with
  a collection date on or before May 31, 2006, are processed.  When the
  process concludes, the PANEL PROCESS DATE field is re-set to July 17, 2006.
   
  Lab personnel may request a report of pending AMA/Billable panel tests that
  may be included in an upcoming roll-up to PCE.  The new menu option Print
  AMA CPT Panel Pending List [LRBE PENDREP] will list pending AMA/Billable 
  panel tests, collected in the calendar month prior to the PANEL PROCESS
  DATE, that have no valid CPT/HCPCS Code and/or still have atomic tests
  pending.  The report is sent to the requesting user via MailMan with a
  Subject header of "AMA/Billable Panel Pending List <current date>".  The
  new report option is located in the Lab Liaison menu [LRLIAISON].
   
  Panels within Panels
  --------------------
   
  If a panel test is included as a component test within another panel, it is
  the AMA COMPLIANT/BILLABLE PANEL field (#508) of the top-level panel that
  controls the transmission of CPT codes to PCE.  All atomic tests contained
  in the sub-panel(s) are treated as if they were individual atomic tests of
  the top-level panel.
  
  If the top-level panel is flagged as AMA/Billable, then all required atomic
  tests contained in each sub-panel must be verified before the CPT/HCPCS
  Code (i.e., the 'bundled' CPT code) of the top-level panel can be sent to
  PCE.  If any one of the required atomic tests within either the top-level
  panel or a sub-panel is cancelled/not performed, then a CPT code for each
  verified atomic test will be sent to PCE (i.e., the top-level panel and 
  each sub-panel will be 'unbundled').  The AMA/Billable status of the sub-
  panel has no effect on this process.
  
  If the top-level panel is not flagged as AMA/Billable, then the CPT/HCPCS
  code for each individually verified atomic test is sent to PCE (i.e.,
  panels are 'unbundled').  This is true even for the atomic tests on a sub-
  panel flagged as AMA/Billable.
   
  Exploded Panels
  ---------------
   
  Existing LAB functionality dictates that any panel test which does not
  have an assigned ACCESSION AREA for the INSTITUTION at which it is being 
  performed is 'exploded' during accessioning.  (These are fields within 
  the ACCESSION AREA multiple (#6) of the LABORATORY TEST file (#60).)
  Components of an exploded panel are processed as if they were ordered
  and accessioned as separate entities.
   
  If the exploded panel contains sub-panels, the AMA/Billable status of the
  top-level panel will have no effect on whether CPT codes for atomic tests
  within a sub-panel are bundled or unbundled.  Each sub-panel will be
  processed according to its own AMA/Billable status.
  
  If the top-level panel itself contains atomic tests, then they will be
  sent to PCE as individual CPT Codes (i.e., unbundled) as they are verified,
  regardless of the AMA/Billable status of the parent panel.
