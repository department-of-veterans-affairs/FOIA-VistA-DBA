Description:
============

 ** Notice: See "Installation Instructions" section for Installation
            Warning **
  
 This patch corrects the following issue:
 When a new style cross reference is included in a compiled cross 
 reference, the Set/Kill logic was not properly executed.  This patch
 corrects the Compile Cross Reference routines and as part of the post
 installation will check to see if a file's cross references are compiled
 and if so re-compile them using the new code.

 *Note: Routine: DIENVWRN issues a warning during the installation of 
 this patch if it appears that TaskMan is still running and/or logons have
 not been inhibited.  Routine DIENVWRN should already exist on your 
 system. It is listed in the routine section as a courtesy to the installer
 because it is listed when doing the "CHECK^XTSUMBLD" and selecting the
 "Build" option.
  
 Routine DIPOS140 will search for those files on the target system whose
 cross references are compiled and recompile the cross references.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 ** Although queuing of this patch is allowed, it is HIGHLY recommended 
 that ALL Users be off the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED 
 before this patch is installed. Failure to do so may result in 'source 
 routine edited' errors during a database update. Edits may be lost and 
 records may be left in an inconsistent state. An error that occurs before 
 a cross-reference is executed, for example, may lead to corrupted data or 
 hard errors in the future. **
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise that 
 the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than a minute.
  
      1.  AXP/DSM sites: Review your mapped routine set. If any of the 
 routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should 
 be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
      2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
 option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
      3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
 system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
      4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following options:
  
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
  
      5.  In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
 installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and ALL 
 non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site specific 
 procedures. For example,
  
            Inhibit users' login into the system.
            Stop the Background Filers.
            AXP/DSM Sites - Place TaskMan in a WAIT State.
            OpenM/Cache Sites - STOP TaskMan.
  
 Not performing this step could result in 'source routine edited' errors
 during database updates, and records may be left in an inconsistent state.
  
      6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following option:
  
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*140
                                 ===========
  
 The Environment Check Routine DIENVWRN runs automatically during this
 step. DIENVWRN issues a warning if it appears that TaskMan is still 
 running or logons have not been inhibited.
  
            Answer 'YES' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
 install?'
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
 Options, and Protocols?
  
      7.  AXP/DSM Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your 
 map set, if necessary.
  
      8.  Reenable all processes stopped in step 5 above. For example:
  
            AXP/DSM Sites - Remove TaskMan from WAIT State.
            OpenM/Cache Sites - Restart TaskMan.
            Restart the Background Filers.
            Enable users' login.
