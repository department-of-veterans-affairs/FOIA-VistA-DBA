Associated patches: (v)OR*3*165    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*177'

Subject: Additional event delayed order fixes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will fix a number of issues related to event delayed
 orders functionality.
  
 1. TAM-0103-32035     DC+6~ORQ20:2 on details for d/c'd orders
  
 When performing a detailed display, a hard error may occur. The error is
 due to patient movement data being unavailable for the order.  A change
 has been made to prevent the error from occurring, when no data is
 available.
  
 2. CIN-0203-40155     SYSTEM PARAMETERS SHOW BROKEN POINTERS
  
 With the installation of patch OR*3*141 (GUI v20), a number of Order 
 Entry parameters became obsolete.  These parameters were deleted, however 
 the corresponding entries that pointed to these parameters were not
 deleted.  When displaying the System parameter settings, broken pointer 
 values were displayed. A post-init routine (ORY177) will remove these
 broken pointers.  This routine may be deleted after installation of this
 patch.
  
 3. CPH-0103-40718 Event Delayed Orders: Treating Specialty/Location
    warning
  
 When writing delayed orders, a warning box is presented if the patient's 
 current location and/or treating specialty matches the definition of the 
 event chosen.  If the event were a child event, this warning box was not
 displayed.  The warning box will now display as expected.
  
 4. BEC-0103-21953     Outpatient Meds Not D/C'ing Upon Admission
  
 When an admission auto-dc rule is defined and it includes outpatient 
 medications, the outpatient medications were not auto-discontinuing as 
 expected.  Outpatient medications are screened from the active orders 
 display for inpatients.  When assembling orders to be considered for 
 auto-discontinuing, outpatient medications were omitted from the list, as
 the patient was already an inpatient at the time the auto-discontinue
 rules were invoked.  Outpatient medications are now included in the list
 of orders when an admission auto-discontinue rule is invoked.
  
 5. MAD-1202-42027     Orders not DC after discharge from readmit
    WRJ-1202-11753     EDO PROBLEM WITH OBSEVATION RE-ADMIT
  
 When a patient is discharged from observation and immediately readmitted 
 for follow up care, their existing inpatient orders may be "carried over" 
 to the new episode of care.  These orders should be subject to any active 
 auto-discontinue rule when movements occur.  Prior to this patch, these 
 orders were not considered for auto-discontinuing when subsequent 
 movements occurred, as they were outside of the current admission 
 timeframe, which is used to determine which orders should be affected.  
 Orders "carried over" are now properly considered for auto-discontinuing 
 on any subsequent movement.
  
 6. Related to the above NOIS, if a delayed generic admission order were 
 entered for the patient's admission onto an observation ward, it was not 
 being auto-discontinued as expected.  The logic has been changed so that 
 this order, if it exists, will be auto-discontinued when the patient is 
 discharged from observation, regardless of whether they will have follow 
 up care or not.
  
 7. When a patient is discharged from observation and the patient will
 be immediately readmitted for follow up care, any inpatient medications
 that are discontinued by inpatient pharmacy are stored for reinstatement
 upon readmission. Readmission must occur within one hour for the orders to
 be reinstated. Prior to this patch, the time comparison was being done
 incorrectly and the orders would reinstate regardless of how much time had
 passed. The logic has been updated so that orders are only reinstated if
 less than one hour has elapsed since the patient's discharge from
 observation.
  
 8. When a patient is discharged from an observation ward and will be 
 immediately readmitted for follow up care, there was no check to make 
 sure the patient was actually readmitted.  Orders that were protected 
 with the expectation that the patient would be readmitted were never 
 auto-discontinued.  New functionality has been added that starts a timer 
 that will check the status of the patient one hour after discharge from 
 observation.  If the patient is not readmitted within the one hour time 
 frame, the orders that were protected will be auto-discontinued as if the 
 patient had been discharged directly from the observation ward.
