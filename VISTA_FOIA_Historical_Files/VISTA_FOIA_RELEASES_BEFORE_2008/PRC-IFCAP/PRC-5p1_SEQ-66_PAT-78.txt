Subject: REMOVAL OF DATA CLEANSING OPTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Sites that tested PRC*5.1*73 (which was cancelled before national 
 release), MUST back out the patch.  The BEFORE CHECKSUMS for PRC*5.1*78
 will be incorrect unless PRC*5.1*73 is backed out.
  
  
 This patch removes the components included with the following data
 cleansing patches that were nationally released:
  
       PRC*5.1*60  COREFLS VENDOR FILE CLEANSING REPORT
       PRC*5.1*61  COREFLS GENERIC INVENTORY FILE CLEANSING REPORT
       PRC*5.1*66  COREFLS PURCHASE ORDER CLEANSING REPORT
       PRC*5.1*69  DATA CLEANSING FOR FILE 440 (LOCAL VENDOR)
  
 These patches were used in the data cleansing effort of IFCAP data 
 pursuant to the conversion of data to the Core Financial Logistics System
 (CoreFLS).  As of October 1, 2004 the operational test site that was using
 CoreFLS was reverted to its pre-CoreFLS state and the CoreFLS project was
 suspended. Consequently halting data cleansing efforts and requiring that
 components of the aforementioned data cleansing patches be removed at each
 site.
  
 This patch only removes options, routines, and the security key for using 
 the CoreFLS Data Cleansing menu and related options from each site.  It
 does not add any components to the site.
  
 The CoreFLS Data Cleansing menu (option PRCL COREFLS DATA CLEANSING) is a
 child option of the IFCAP Coordinator's Main Menu [PRCHUSER
 COORDINATOR].  If the Data Cleansing menu or any other Data Cleansing
 option is associated with other menus at the site, manually remove that
 option from those menus after PRC*5.1*78 is installed.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
   1.   FGH-0304-32256: COREFLS DATA CLEANSING - FILE 440
        **This is now Remedy help desk ticket #HD55501**
  
   2.   TAM-0304-32747: Showing errors on vendor file
        **This is now Remedy help desk ticket #HD55506**
  
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 FHG-0304-32256
  
   1.   Problem:
        --------
        Test site requests that certain fields be changed to mandatory when
        adding records to file 440.
  
        Resolution:
        -----------
        Ticket was referred to development for review, no further action
        taken.
  
  
 TAM-0304-32747
  
    2.  Problem:
        --------
        CoreFLS Detailed Vendor report showing errors that are not
        errors.  This is making identification of actual errors more
        difficult.
  
        Resolution:
        -----------
        Developers had made patch PRC*5.1*73 to correct this error, among
        other issues the patch would address.  Patch PRC*5.1*73 was never
        released.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
   1.   Martinsburg VAMC
   2.   Clarksburg VAMC
   3.   West LA VAMC
   4.   Wilmington VAMC
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
          IFCAP Application Coordinator Menu [PRCHUSER COORDINATOR]
  
  
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes
  
        ************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
  
        Test Sites that installed PRC*5.1*73 (which was cancelled before
        national release) MUST back out PRC*5.1*73.  Unless PRC*5.1*73 is
        backed out before PRC*5.1*78 is installed, the BEFORE CHECKSUMS for
        PRC*5.1*78 will be incorrect.

        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow

                                    ----------------
        **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch: 
    
        a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch
            install.
  
        b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion 
            of Install? YES//' answer NO if your site has a nightly 
            background job that performs this action, else answer YES
  
        c.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
            YES//' answer NO (unless otherwise indicated)
  
        d.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
            Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer YES

            Order':' press <return>.
  
   7.   REBUILD MAPPED ROUTINE(S)  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
        -------------------------
        Optional - Include the routines distributed with this patch
        in the mapped routine set.
      
        NOTE:  This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or 
               if you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
