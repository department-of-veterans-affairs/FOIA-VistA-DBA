Subject: NEW REMINDER COMPONENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch adds a new Health Summary component, CLINICAL REMINDERS
 SUMMARY (abbreviation CRS), and renames the two existing reminder
 components so all the names are consistent. Details of the renaming can
 be found in item number 2 of the Detailed Routine Description. The new
 component is similar to the existing PCE CLINICAL REMINDERS component
 in that it only shows the NEXT and LAST information. However, this
 component shows all selected reminders not just those that are due now.
 Reminders that are N/A are included unless the IGNORE ON N/A field
 (field #1.8 in file #811.9 PCE REMINDER/MAINTENANCE ITEM) has been set.
  
 In order for this component to work PCE patch PX*1.0*42 must be
 installed. Therefore this patch should be installed after PX*1.0*42.
  
 NOTE:  If it becomes necessary to install this patch again you need to
 check to make sure that the CLINICAL REMINDERS SUMMARY component is at
 internal entry number 233 in the HEALTH SUMMARY  COMPONENT (#142.1)
 file. If it is not then you will need to delete the component before
 re-installing or you'll get duplicate entries.  If it is at that
 location this patch can be re-installed without incidence.

 Detailed Routine Description:
 =============================
 1. Routine:  GMTSPXHR
 This routine was changed so that the new component described above
 could be used.
  
 2. Routine: GMTS23IN
 This routine contains the pre and post-inits. The pre-init changes the name
 of the PCE CLINICAL REMINDER component to CLINICAL REMINDERS DUE and
 the PCE CLINICAL MAINTENANCE to CLINICAL REMINDERS MAINTENANCE.
 These changes were made to make the relationship between the existing
 reminder components and the new reminder component more clear.
  
 The post-init changes the default header names in existing Health
 Summary Types to the new ones shown below in number 4. This is done
 only if the existing names match exactly with the old ones. The Ad Hoc
 Health Summary is reloaded so the new component, CRS, is included.
 During the installation the installer will be ask if disabled
 components should be included in the Ad Hoc Health Summary. The answer
 should be according to your site's practices.
  
 After the installation has completed this routine can be deleted.
   
 3. Routine:  GMTSLOAD
 The writes in this routine where changed to be compatible with KIDS.
  
 4. Data Dictionary:  GMT(142.1), HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT.
 A new entry, PCE CLINICAL REMINDERS SUMMARY, corresponding to the new
 component described in the General Overview was added. Its abbreviation
 is CRS. In addition the descriptions of the already existing Clinical
 Reminder components were clarified. Default Header Names have been
 changed as follows:
  
         OLD                     NEW
  --------------------------------------------
  Clinical Maintenance    Reminder Maintenance
  Clinical Reminders      Reminders Due
