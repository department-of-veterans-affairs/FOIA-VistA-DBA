  - Routine

Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*50 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
  
 DESCRIPTION
 ===========
  
 When the Lab LEDI software needs to build a HL7 message to return lab
 test results (ORU) to the collecting facility, the message building could
 fail at the host laboratory facility causing the collecting facility not
 to receive a result message. This problem occurs when the host lab's entry
 for the collecting facility in the INSTITUTION file (#4) has an internal
 entry number which is different from the VA Station Number. The software
 is assuming that the station number and the internal entry are the same.
  
 Routine LA7VMSG has been changed to retrieve the VA Station Number from
 the INSTITUTION file for the collecting facility's entry when the station
 number is used in building the result (ORU) message.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   However the following conditions apply:
  
      - All Laboratory test verification should be suspended. The install
        will disable lab verifying options during installation.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel, MailMan and HL7 patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
       prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
       option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in your
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
       a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   7.  The install will disable the following Lab verifying options during
       patch installation.
  
       Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR]
       Enter/verify data (Work list) [LRVRW]
       Enter/verify data (Load list) [LRVRW2]
       Batch data entry (chem, hem, tox, etc.) [LRSTUF]
       Group verify (EA, EL, EW) [LRGV]
  
  
   8.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*50'.  When prompted 'Want to
       DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',
       choose 'NO'.
  
   9. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  10. Routine LA50 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
