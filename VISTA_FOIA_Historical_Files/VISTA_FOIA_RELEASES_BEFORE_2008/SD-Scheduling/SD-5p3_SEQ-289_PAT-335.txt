Subject: Additional Performance Monitors (TIU)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Two problems were identified when running the reports released in patch 
 SD*5.3*292. 
  
 1. The scanned document counter was not being incremented correctly since
 the check to increment the counter was using the wrong value ("YES"
 instead of "1"). 
  
 2. Scanned documents were not suppose to be counted for or against the
 performance measure.  When calculating the percentages for the report, the
 Scanned Documents counter was not being subtracted from the Total
 Encounters counter before calculating percentages. 
  
 Note: If a site scans all progress notes within a division the compliance
 rate will reflect 0 % compliance.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 Routine SDPMUT1 has been modified to check for a value of "1" instead of 
 "YES".
  
 Routines SCRPW301 and SCRPW304 have been modified so that the Scanned 
 Document counter is subtracted from the Total Encounters counter before 
 calculating the compliance percentage rates.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system.  Installation time
 will be less than 2 minutes.
    
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
    
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...
