Subject: NOIS bug fixes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch fixes several NOIS and FORUM mail message problems.
 
 NOIS HOT-0196-40372 When displaying the $JOB number in XUS91, if the number 
 was greater than 127 it was converted to a HEX value needed by DSM sites.
 This caused problems with the newer versions of MSM that can have $JOB values 
 greater than 127.  This has been changed to check for values greater than 32768.
 
 NOIS DAY-1295-41565 In %ZIS3 the use of %ZISQUIT in a hunt group would 
 cause the complete hunt group to fail, not the one entry.  This has been fixed
 by killing %ZISQUIT after each try.
 
 NOIS SAT-0196-71702  The number of characters on the task number that were
 included in the VMS name was to small for the current task numbers at some
 sites.  This has been fixed in %ZTMS3 to allow more characters in the name.
 
 NOIS BRX-0196-10212  The executable help for the related frame subfield
 of the Help frame file has bad code in it that prevents its use.  The
 code has been commented out. (sent as a partial DD for file 9.2)
 
 'IO/%ZTIO MM' TaskMan errors, This was used to confirm and understand an
  issue. The problem is understood and there isn't an need for the entry in
  the error log.  It has been removed from ZTMS2.
 
 Forum # 17283911  On this message it was agreed that IO should be restored
 if POP was returned with a non-zero value.  It currently is returned as 
 'NULL' in this case.  This has been fixed.
  
 Forum # 18837345  The help display of printers was impacted by a screen
 %ZIS("S") that changed the naked.  This did not follow SAC guidelines, 
 and has been fixed in ZIS5.
 
 The OPEN/USE/CLOSE ^%ZISUTL calls didn't work.  This has been fixed in
 ZISUTL and ZIS1.  The setting of IO(0) was changed to only happen one time
 so that IO(0) should always point to the HOME device, fixed in ZIS.
 
 Hans found that the taskman resource logging was not being done. The fix
 was found in XUTMG43.  To make the sorting of taskman work consistent
 the resource log string was changed in %ZTMS and %ZTMS3
 
 It was found that the order of events during error trapping needed 
 improvement, also requested was a hang to allow IO ports to reset during 
 errors. This has been done in %ZTMS.

  Installation:
   
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.
   2. Answer NO to the question:
      'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'
   3. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
      'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
      have the correct checksum.
   4. Inhibit users from login into system. 
      Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
   5. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option 'Install
      Package(s)' Select the package 'XU*8.0*18' and proceed with install.
   6. After installing this patch, you need to move several routines from 
      your productions account to the manager account:
      ZIS
      ZIS1
      ZIS3
      ZIS5
      ZISUTL
      ZTER
      ZTER1
      ZTMS
      ZTMS2
      ZTMS3
      and in the manager account rename
      ZIS    to %ZIS
      ZIS1   to %ZIS1
      ZIS3   to %ZIS3
      ZIS5   to %ZIS5
      ZISUTL to %ZISUTL
      ZTER   to %ZTER
      ZTER1  to %ZTER1
      ZTMS   to %ZTMS
      ZTMS2  to %ZTMS2
      ZTMS3  to %ZTMS3
  
         Example: ZL ZOSVVXD ZS %ZOSV
         
   7.  On MSM move the routines to the other servers.  
       On DSM, rebuild your map set.  
   8. Enable user's login.
      Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.
