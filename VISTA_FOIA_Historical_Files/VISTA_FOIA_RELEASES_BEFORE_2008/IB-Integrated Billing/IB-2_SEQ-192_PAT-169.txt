Description: 
============

 The primary purpose of this patch is to update the Integrated Billing 
 Charge Master to allow the upload and use of Reasonable Charges v1.4.  
                 
 The loading of Reasonable Charges is a two step process. First, this patch must 
 be installed, then the charges must be uploaded into your Charge Master.  
 The instructions for the charge upload step are included in this 
 description, after the patch Installation Instructions.
              
 Note that there was no version 1.3 of Reasonable Charges.  The last 
 released version was version 1.2 effective on 05/08/01.
                 
 The following are the specific enhancements included in this patch:
                                     
 o  Added the capability to load Reasonable Charges version 1.4.
                  
 o  The 9 Reasonable Charges Host Files are named: 'IBRC0304x.TXT' w/x=A-I
                  
 o  The effective date of Reasonable Charges version 1.4 is 04/29/03.
                 
 o  There are 10 CPT codes that have Outpatient Facility charges that may 
    only be billed at specific sites.  These sites generally correspond to 
    sites that perform Inpatient Hospital care.  The charges for these CPT 
    codes will only be loaded for the appropriate sites.
          
    The 10 CPT codes are:  
    99201, 99202, 99203, 99204, 99205, 99211, 99212, 99213, 99214, 99215
               
    All sites that have Inpatient Facility charges will receive the
    Outpatient Facility charge for these 10 CPT codes except the following 
    7 sites:  463 - ANCHORAGE, AK,         512PB - PERRY POINT PRRTP, MD,  
              550PA - DANVILLE PRRTP, IL,  691A4 - SEPULVEDA, CA,  
              692 - WHITE CITY, OR,        756 - EL PASO, TX,  
              757 - COLUMBUS, OH
              
 o  After RC v1.1, Modifier 26 was automatically added to certain CPT codes 
    on professional bills.  
       - 75952, 75953, have been added to the list of CPT codes that are 
         automatically assigned Modifier 26 for version 1.4 only. These two 
         codes will not automatically receive modifier 26 before 04/29/03.  
             
 o  Laboratory charges are calculated as Physician charges. However, many 
    Laboratory procedures should normally be billed on the UB-92 as 
    Facility charges.  Therefore, during the upload and after all charges for a 
    site have been calculated, most RC v1.4 charges for procedures in the 
    8xxxx range will be transferred from the Physician Charge Sets to the 
    Outpatient Facility Charge Sets.  This will cause the default billing 
    form for these codes to be the UB-92.
                  
    Some Laboratory charges for consults and other professional services 
    will remain in the Physician Charge Sets.  The following list are the 
    91 8xxxx procedures that will not be transferred.  The default billing 
    form for these codes will continue to be the HCFA 1500:
      80500          80502        83020          83912          84165
      84181          84182        85060          85097          85390
      85576          86077        86078          86079          86255
      86256          86320        86325          86327          86334
      87164          87207        88000-88130    88141          88160-88162
      88172-88182    88291        88300-88372    89060-89105    89130-89141
                
 o  The Charge upload has been modified to add the Inactivation Date of a 
    version as the Inactivation Date of all loaded charges, if it is known.
       -  RC v1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 11/01/00.
       -  RC v1.1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 05/07/01.
       -  RC v1.2 Charges will have an inactivation date of 04/28/03.
             
 o  When installed, this patch will update the Revenue Code - CPT links 
    used to assign Revenue Codes to CPT charges on bills.
                 
 o  When installed, this patch will automatically delete any Charge Sets 
    that have no charges assigned.  (Except Charge Sets of VA Cost Type.)
                    
 o  When installed, this patch will automatically add an inactivation date 
    to all Reasonable Charges entries in the Charge Master.  This will 
    ensure that charges are not used after they have been replaced by a new 
    version.
       -  RC v1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 11/01/00.
       -  RC v1.1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 05/07/01.
       -  RC v1.2 Charges will have an inactivation date of 04/28/03.
                   
    The result will be no billable Reasonable Charges for care on or after 
    04/29/03. Until, the second step of this patch is completed, and new RC 
    v1.4 charges are loaded.
              
              
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
 ======================
 There are no E3R or NOIS messages associated with this patch.
                    
 This patch contains 10 routines, 3 are Post Init routines (IBYPPH*).
              
 The Post-Init will perform the following 4 tasks:
 o  Delete all entries in the BILLING REVENUE CODE LINKS file (#363.33)
 o  Add new entries in the BILLING REVENUE CODE LINKS file (#363.33)
 o  Inactivate all Reasonable Charges entries in the Charge Master Charge 
    Item file (#363.2).
 o  Deletes Charge Sets in the Charge Master that have no associated Charge 
    Items.
                  
               
 INSTALLATION:
 =============
               
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible 
 conflicts while running the KIDS Install.  Other VISTA users will not 
 be affected.
                          
    Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
    Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER]
    Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER]
    Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD]
                        
 Install Time should be less than 25 minutes, however this will be 
 variable.  The post-init loops though the Charge Master Charge file 
 assigning inactive dates to all Reasonable Charges Charge Items.  
 Therefore the time required will depend on how many Reasonable Charges 
 sets are defined on your system.

      The 9 RC v1.4 charge host files must be obtained from one of the 
      Anonymous Directories, in ASCII format (IBRC0304x.TXT w x=A-I). 
      See the Reasonable Charges v1.4 Upload Instructions below.
                    
 10.   UPLOAD REASONABLE CHARGES V1.4
      ------------------------------
      Load charges for every division that has care billed at your site.
      See the Reasonable Charges v1.4 Upload Instructions below.
                
                
 ============== Reasonable Charges v1.4 Upload Instructions ==============
            
           
 After patch installation, the RC v1.4 charges for each division billed 
 at a site will need to be loaded into the Charge Master.  The charges for 
 each division will require approximately 1.1-1.3Mb of disk space.
                    
                        
 Files Required for Upload:
 ==========================
 The charge files are available on the following CIO Field Offices' 
 Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability to 
 retrieve the files (ASCII).

 Upload Instructions:
 ====================
                 
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 9 Reasonable Charges v1.4 Host Files in ASCII format (see 
 previous section).
                       
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
 print the Billing Region Report to find out which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
 that will need new charges loaded.
                   
 Step 3:  Run Upload Process
 ---------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option to 
 load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which 
 care is billed at your site
                
 Step 4:  Select 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
 ---------------------------------------
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges 
 for individual divisions.
            
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded it will ask 
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 1.4
                 
   - If there exists any charges previously calculated for a division they 
     will be displayed. It will ask if they should be deleted.  
     Select Yes - delete the previously calculated charges.
                     
   - If there exists any previously loaded host files for an RC version 
     they will be displayed. It will ask if they should be deleted.  
     * Select Yes, only if the files are not for the correct version.  
     * Select No if the files are IBCR0304x.TXT and you are loading RC v1.4
                 
   Select Division:  select the division number to load charges for.  This 
   should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing Regions 
   determined previously.
              
 Step 5: Select 3 - Check Data Validity
 ---------------------------------------
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for the 
 first division loaded.  If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors 
 then check that the latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.
                
 Step 6: Select 4 - Load into Charge Master
 ------------------------------------------
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
               
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report determined previously.
                  
                   
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, selection 1.4, to calculate RC v1.4 charges for a division
 o  Option 4 to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site or a site that may have 
 changed it's division number then extra care is needed to ensure the set 
 up of the Charge Master is correct.  Following sections provide some 
 additional information about the upload.
                
                        
 Example Reasonable Charges v1.4 Upload Summary Report (CBOC): 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 Loading Reasonable Charges v1.4 (step 6 above), for any division with 
 Outpatient Care only, should always result in a summary with these exact 
 numbers:

 Example Reasonable Charges v1.4 Upload Summary Report (Inpatient Site): 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Loading Reasonable Charges v1.4 (step 6 above), for any division that 
 provides Inpatient Care, should always result in a summary with these exact 
 numbers, with the following exception:
 o Seven Divisions will receive only 5189 Outpatient Facility Charges 
   rather than 5199.  These are the 10 E&M facility charges available to 
   all Inpatient Facilities except 463, 512PB, 550PA, 691A4, 692, 756, 757.

 General Upload Instructions:
 ----------------------------
 Retrieve the 9 Reasonable Charges Host Files in ASCII format for the 
 version desired.
                       
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
 print the Billing Region Report to find out which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.
                   
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option to 
 load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which 
 care is billed at your site:
                      
   1.3       Load RC into XTMP
             Load the host files and calculate the charges for a division 
             at your site.  Possible Selections:               
                  1         Reasonable Charges version 1
                  1.1       Reasonable Charges version 1.1
                  1.2       Reasonable Charges version 1.2
                  1.4       Reasonable Charges version 1.4
                      
   2         Assign Charge Set
             Assign or re-assign the charges calculated to the correct 
             Charge Sets.  This option is only needed if the Charges 
             calculated are assigned to a Division number in the new 
             version that is different than the Division number used in 
             previous versions of RC.
                       
   3         Check Data Validity
             Runs through the load into the Charge Master without 
             actually making any changes, and reports any problems found.
                       
   4         Load into Charge Master
             Load the updated charges into the Charge Master for 
             the site requested.
                   
   5         Delete XTMP files
             Deletes all temporary files created for the upload process.  
             This selection is optional. All temporary files are deleted 
             automatically after 2 days.
                      
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 o  Option 4 to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site or a site that may have 
 changed it's division number then extra care is needed to ensure the set 
 up of the Charge Master is correct.  Following sections provide some 
 additional information about the upload.
                       
                       
 Loading Reasonable Charges in Version Order:
 --------------------------------------------
                    
 IMPORTANT:  The versions of Reasonable Charges must be loaded in order.  
 Reasonable Charges v1 should be loaded first, then v1.1, then v1.2, then 
 v1.4.
                   
 In most cases, this will be automatic since a site should have previous 
 versions of Reasonable Charges already loaded on their system for all the 
 required divisions.  If this order is not preserved, messages will be 
 displayed when a site is chosen for charge calculation.
                           
 For a particular site, RC v1 should never be loaded after RC v1.1, and RC 
 v1.1 should never be loaded after RC v1.2.
                    
 Only if a division will never have billable care provided before the 
 effective date of one of the versions should that version be loaded 
 without first loading the previous version(s).
          
 If a new division needs charges then use the first date the division will 
 provide billable care and the following to determine which versions of 
 Reasonable Charges need to be loaded for the division:
 o  Division will provide care before 11/02/00, load:  v1, v1.1, v1.2, v1.4
 o  Division will not provide care before 11/02/00, load:  v1.1, v1.2, v1.4
 o  Division will not provide care before 05/08/01, load:  v1.2, v1.4
 o  Division will not provide care before 04/29/03, load:  v1.4
                         
 To preserve the correct date range a version applies to, Reasonable 
 Charges are uploaded with an inactivation date assigned to each charge, if 
 one is known.
 o  RC v1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 11/01/00.
 o  RC v1.1 Charges will have an inactivation date of 05/07/01.
 o  RC v1.2 Charges will have an inactivation date of 04/28/03.
                 
                         
 Identifying Charges for a Site in the Host Files:
 ------------------------------------------------
                
 Professional and Outpatient Facility charges for all geographic regions in 
 the country are provided in the Host Charge Files for all versions of 
 Reasonable Charges, except v1.
                 
 The charges in the Host Files are identified by site numbers.  The charges 
 associated with those site numbers correspond to the charges appropriate 
 to the Billing Region that contains the site location.
            
 o  If a VA site does not exist within a region, then that region's charges 
    are identified in the Host files by a temporary fake division number 
    starting with a 9 (902X1-FACILITY AT ZIP CODE 996).  
           
 o  Many new or proposed sites did not have a final official division 
    number assigned when the charge files were completed.  Therefore, some 
    sites are identified using a temporary fake division number containing 
    an 'X' (405X1-BERLIN, NH).  
            
 After the charge calculation is complete, if the site did not have a valid 
 division number assigned, then the user will be asked for the correct valid 
 division number and potentially for the correct valid division name.  If a 
 new division number/name is not entered at this point, then it may be 
 corrected at any time using the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY 
 CHARGE MASTER] option.
                                
                           
 Updating Charges for Existing Billing Regions/Divisions:
 --------------------------------------------------------
          
 IMPORTANT: For a division, the same Charge Sets in the Charge Master must 
 be used for the charges from each version of Reasonable Charges (v1, v1.1, 
 v1.2, v1.4).  In most cases this is automatic.  The only instances where a 
 correction is required is if division numbers changed from one version to 
 the next.
           
 When calculating Reasonable Charges for a division, Charge Sets will be 
 assigned to those calculations based on the division selected.  These 
 Charge Sets may be newly created if there are no existing charges for the 
 division in the Charge Master or they may be previously existing Charge 
 Sets.
                      
 If there are already charges on a system for a division, then it is 
 important that the same Charge Sets are used to load RC v1.4 charges.  
 These Charge Sets are identified by the division number originally loaded 
 in RC v1, v1.1, or v1.2.  In most cases, this will be automatic since the 
 division number for a site has not been changed, so the same division 
 number was used in each version. In this case, no changes will be required.
                  
 However, if a site has changed division numbers, then either all version 
 charges for both division numbers must be uploaded or the charges to be 
 uploaded have to be re-assigned to the existing Charge Sets by using the 
 option Assign Charge Set (2), within Load Host File into Charge Master 
 [Load Host File into Charge Master] option.  This must be done before step 
 4 - loading the charges into the Charge Master.
                                 
 For Example: Albany, NY was exported under division 500 in RC v1.  Albany 
 has now been integrated and has a new division number, 528A8.  When the RC 
 v1.4 charges are loaded for Albany, they must use the same Charge Sets 
 that currently exist on their systems.  
 o  The Legacy system still uses the 500-Albany Charge Sets. Therefore, the 
    RC v1.4 charges must be loaded into these sets.  
 o  The Integrated system uses the 528A8-Albany Charge Sets. Therefore, the 
    RC v1.4 charges must be loaded into these sets.
                          
 During the upload process in option 1.3, there are two points that 
 indicate if existing Charge Sets are used or new ones created.  After 
 selecting a division to calculate charges, a notice will be printed 
 indicating if the division does not appear to have previous versions 
 loaded.  Also, when calculating the charges, it displays which charges are 
 being calculated and which Charge Sets will be used for those charges.  
 All previously existing divisions should indicate that an existing Charge 
 Set is being used, not that a new Charge Set was added.  If this is not 
 the case, then re-assign the charges to the correct Charge Sets.
                                          
 If unsure of which Charge Sets to use, contact National Vista Support 
 for assistance.
                    
                 
 New Divisions/CBOCs:
 --------------------
                
 When new divisions are opened, the charges needed for that division are 
 determined by the zip code of the physical location of the new division.
 If unsure of which set of rates to use for a new division, contact 
 National Vista Support for assistance.
                             
                          
 Loading and Assigning Charges for a Specific Division:
 ------------------------------------------------------
                
 IMPORTANT:  Each division must be assigned to the correct Billing Region, 
 based on the divisions location.  This is automatic if each division has 
 it's own set of charges loaded.  The only instance where user interaction 
 is required is when one region is assigned multiple divisions.
                    
 Reasonable Charges is specific to geographic areas or regions.  Each 
 division billed by the site must be assigned the correct charges based on 
 it's physical location.
                
 o  When charges are loaded for a specific division, a Billing Region is 
    created with that division as the primary division.
                             
 o  For Outpatient Facility and Professional charges the geographic area of 
    the Billing Region is defined by the primary divisions 3-digit zip 
    code.
          
 o  All sites within the same 3-digit zip code may use the same set of 
    Reasonable Charges.  This may be accomplished by loading one set of 
    charges for the region and then assigning all divisions within that 
    3-digit zip code to the Billing Region.
                                              
 o  If a division has been assigned to a Billing Region in the Charge 
    Master and it is not the primary division for that region, then charges 
    do not need to be loaded for it.  The primary divisions charges should 
    be loaded instead.
                       
 o  If a division has charges loaded and is also assigned as a division to 
    another Billing Region, then the division will have two sets of charges 
    assigned.  This will result in each item being billed two charges on 
    each claim. 
                
 o  The divisions assigned to Billing Regions in the Charge Master will be 
    deleted if the division is not within the geographic area of the 
    region.  
                         
    When the RC v1.1, v1.2, or v1.4 Host Files are loaded, the existing 
    Billing Regions will be evaluated.  If there is a division assigned to 
    a region whose 3-digit zip code does not match the region's primary 
    divisions 3-digit zip code, then that division is deleted from the 
    Billing Region and a message displayed.
                
    If a division is deleted from a Billing Region, then it no longer has 
    charges assigned.  The division will either need it's own charges 
    loaded or it may be added to another existing Billing Region that has 
    the correct 3-digit zip code.
