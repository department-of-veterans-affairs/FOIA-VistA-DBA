 Description:
 ===========
 This patch re-releases the VA-IRAQ & AFGHAN POST-DEPLOY SCREEN reminder. Some 
 of the changes to the reminder are:
 
 1. Each section can now be done individually so that one user may do part and 
    someone else may do another piece. This means that someone may do a section 
    and the reminder will remain due until all questions are complete.
 
 2. If a section has been done recently (past 6 months) then it will be 
    displayed in a closed format with a message that this was done recently and 
    the user can click to open and repeat.
  
 3. The clinical maintenance display will always show which pieces are complete 
    and which are still pending.
  
 4. The PTSD screen has been changed to capture the answers to the 4 questions 
    as individual health factors so that the users do not have to do the scoring
    themselves.  
  
 5. The first question has been modified to capture OEF vs. OIF service and when
    one of these 2 options is chosen then the user has to choose one country for
    the most recent service.  
  
 6. Once the OEF vs. OIF service is captured (first question answered), this 
    question is not asked again if the reminder is re-entered to complete other 
    sections.  This section will be displayed in a 'closed' format.
 
 7. There are refusal options for all 4 sections.
  
 8. There is a new computed finding for VA-PATIENT TYPE. This can be used (if a 
    site chooses) to include active duty personnel in the cohort to be screened.
    The CF looks at the 'TYPE' field in the patient file.  
  
 9. There is a URL in the reminder dialog that links to a paper copy of the 
    questionnaire that can be used to obtain the information from the patients 
    without having to read the questions to them.  If you want to save a copy of
    this MS Word document on a local server, you can change the URL in the 
    template field to point to your local server.
 
 This reminder will be placed in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file (#811.8).
       VA-IRAQ & AFGHAN POST-DEPLOY SCREEN
 
 A new Reminder Sponsor "Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards" is 
 being released with this patch.
 
 A change was made to the Data Dictionary Structure for file #811.6. This change
 was done to bring the structure similar to the other reminder files.

 Host File:
 ==========
 This patch will be available only as a host file. The name of the file is 
 PXRM_2_0_5.KID.
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software via FTP.  The preferred method is to FTP the
 file from download.vista.med.va.gov.  This transmits the file from the first 
 available FTP server.  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from 
 a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.foalbany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
