Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*60 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 Patch LA*5.2*60 addresses a fix to the option Keypad differential for
 CRT's [LA KB DIFF]. It was determined, during testing of another patch,
 that the lab verifying process would trigger the transmission of the
 wrong patient's results when verifying an accession received via Laboratory
 Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI). The variable LRORU3 is used by the
 lab verifying process to trigger the building of a HL7 result (ORU) message
 to transmit the test results to the requesting facility. Patch LA*5.2*60
 changes routine LAKDIFF3 to set the variable LRORU3 based on the current
 accession before calling the lab verifying process.
  
 The "Heads-Up on Patient Safety Alert" issued on 18 January 2002 regarding
 the electronic transmission of an incorrect result from a LEDI Host
 laboratory to a Collecting Laboratory is resolved by patch LA*5.2*60.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 1 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system. Users should
   not be using option Keypad differential for CRT's [LA KB DIFF] during
   patch installation. The KIDS install will disable this option during
   installation. Suggested time to install: anytime the option LA KB DIFF
   is not being used.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
       prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
       option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in your
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
       a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*60'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
       Note: Option Keypad differential for CRT's [LA KB DIFF] will be
       disabled during installation by KIDS.
  
   8. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
   9. Routine LA60 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
