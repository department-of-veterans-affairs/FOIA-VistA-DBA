Subject: CLINICAL INDICATOR DATA CAPTURE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is being distributed to provide enhancements to the Integrated
 Billing package to take advantage of some of the Clinical Indicator Data 
 Capture (CIDC) enhancements in other packages.
  
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
  
 Claims Tracking:
 ----------------
 The Claims Tracking module of Integrated Billing is being enhanced to 
 evaluate outpatient billable events differently.  With the release of 
 CIDC enhancements, data collection of exemptions (SC/AO/IR/EC/MST/HNC/CV) 
 will be done at the purpose of visit (diagnosis) level.  Therefore, when 
 the nightly Claims Tracking module evaluates outpatient events to 
 determine if they are billable the following list of items will be 
 reviewed in this order:
  
      1.  Purpose of Visit/Diagnosis (V POV # 9000010.07 file)
      2.  Outpatient Event/Encounter (Visit #9000010 file)
  
 If any of the Purpose of Visit(s) for a CPT/Procedure are related to one
 of the exemptions, then the CPT/Procedure is considered non-billable.  If
 there are no billable CPT/Procedures for a Visit, then the Visit is
 considered non-billable by Claims Tracking.
  
 When the Claims Tracking module is active for prescription billing, the 
 software will now evaluate any exemptions that were specified for the 
 prescription and flag the event as not billable if applicable.
  
 When the Claims Tracking module is active for prosthetic billing the 
 software will now pick up prosthetic events at time of shipment instead 
 of waiting for time of delivery.  The patient exemptions will also be 
 evaluated.
  
  
 Autobiller:
 -----------
 The Autobiller module of Integrated Billing is being enhanced to utilize 
 CPT/Procedure to Purpose of Visit/Diagnosis association if the 
 association exists.  When the Autobiller runs nightly and bills are 
 created, if the association exists in the PCE package, the association 
 will automatically be stored in the bill to assist in data entry of 
 billing information.
  
 When a prescription bill is being created in the Autobiller the software 
 will now populate the diagnosis code(s) associated with the prescription 
 as specified by the clinician during the ordering process if they exist, 
 if they do not, the default diagnosis that is currently being used will 
 continue to be used.
  
  
 Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]:
 ------------------------------------------------------
 This option is being enhanced to pick up diagnosis code(s) that were 
 specified in the ordering process of a prosthetic device.  When a 
 prosthetic device is selected from Screen 5 the diagnosis code will be 
 automatically added to the bill if it does not already exist.  Also if a 
 prosthetic device is flagged as being exempt for SC or one of the 
 treatment factors a message will be displayed to the user indicating such
 during the selection.
  
 When a bill has prescriptions added to claim, the IB software will now 
 automatically associate the diagnosis codes specified at time of order if 
 they exist, if they do not exist the default diagnosis code will continue 
 to be associated with the claim.  Additionally if there is an exemption 
 reason identified in the Outpatient Pharmacy package the list of
 prescriptions to add to a bill will display the first exemption reason
 found.
  
 When a bill has a procedure that is added to where anesthesia minutes 
 would normally be entered, a look up of anesthesia start and stop times 
 from the Surgery Package for the bill from/to date will be displayed for 
 selection.  Assuming one or more of the start/stop times are selected the 
 total minutes of the selection will be automatically populated in the 
 minutes on the bill for review by the billing staff.
  
 Screen 5, Option 3 is enhanced to display the REASON NOT BILLABLE (CLAIMS 
 TRACKING #356 file, field #.19) if an Outpatient Encounter is already
 marked as not billable to assist with not selecting an outpatient visit.
  
 Screen 5, option 4 has been enhanced.  Billers have the option of 
 selecting procedures for a bill.  If the bill is a professional bill and
 the associated diagnosis is known; the diagnosis will be automatically
 added to the bill if it is not already there and the diagnosis to CPT
 associations will be populated.
  
  
 Observation Start/Stop Times:
 -----------------------------
 Observation Institutional charges require the number of hours the patient 
 was in observation for the charge to calculate.  However, in most cases 
 the observation data is displayed in start and stop times rather than 
 total hours.  Therefore, when entering Observation procedures that require
 hours the following updates were made: 
  
 -  Displays any Observation Discharge that was discharged within 72 hours
    of the procedure's date.
 -  Asks for the observation start date/time and end/date time, using the
    last observation discharge admit/discharge dates as the defaults.
 -  Calculates the total hours and uses that as the Observation Procedure's
    Hours default.
  
 An Observation Discharge is any inpatient stay discharged from one of the 
 following Treating Specialties:
  
     18    NEUROLOGY OBSERVATION
     23    SPINAL CORD INJURY OBSERVATION
     24    MEDICAL OBSERVATION
     36    BLIND REHAB OBSERVATION
     41    REHAB MEDICINE OBSERVATION
     65    SURGICAL OBSERVATION
     94    PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATION
  
  
 CIDC Question Switch:
 ---------------------
 A new parameter switch has been included to control how CIDC functions in 
 all the applications when appropriate.  A new menu option "Edit the CIDC
 Insurance Switch [IB CIDC INSURANCE SWITCH]"  is included in this patch
 attached to the "System Manager's Integrated Billing Menu [IB SITE MGR
 MENU]." It is locked with the IB SUPERVISOR security key.  The choices for
 the CIDC switch are:
  
         0 = Don't ask any patients
         1 = Ask for patients only with active billable insurance
         2 = Ask for all patients
  
 With installation of the patch this parameter is already set to 0; Don't 
 Ask (CIDC related questions) for any patients.  Great care should be
 exercised when changing this option as it will effect how other CIDC
 related applications interact with both providers and back door users.  
 This switch should remain in the "off" position, as delivered.  Sites in 
 VISN 10 that are testing the Patient Financial Services (PFSS) 
 application may change the setting to best meet testing requirements of 
 PFSS.
  
  
  
 PFSS Status Switch:
 -------------------
 As a precursor to the PFSS project a new file PFSS SITE PARAMETERS (#372) 
 is being added with a supported API of $$SWSTAT^IBBAPI to return the 
 status of PFSS at the current site.  The post install will automatically 
 set the PFSS switch to off and no menu option is currently being provided 
 to change this status as the status needs to be set to off for all 
 sites.  It is important that sites do not locally try to modify the 
 switch status stored in the new file. A menu option will be provided in a 
 subsequent patch when it is appropriate.
  
  
  
  
 Technical Description
 --------------------
 IB20P260 is the post init routine that will set the CIDC switch to 0 
 during the post install process.  The post init will also set the PFSS
 switch to OFF and record the date/time in the new PFSS SITE PARAMETERS 
 (#372) file. This routine will automatically be deleted after the install
 is completed.
  
 IBBAPI is the main API entry point for applications and is being updated 
 to include a new entry point ($$CIDC(DFN)) to allow other packages to 
 determine if CIDC questions should be prompted for the patient.  This API 
 evaluates the switch status and the patient's current active billable 
 insurance status.  Also included is the new entry point for checking the 
 current status of PFSS at the local site ($$SWSTAT).
  
 IBBASCI is the processing routine for the $$CIDC^IBBAPI(DFN) call.
  
 IBBASWCH is the processing routine for the $$SWSTAT^IBBAPI call.
  
 IBBDOC is updated to document the new CIDC and PFSS Status API.
  
 IBTRKR3 is being enhanced to evaluate the billing exemptions now being 
 collected when the Claims Tracking module runs for pharmacy events and 
 flag the appropriate reason not billable if applicable.
  
 IBTRKR41 is being enhanced to use the new billable evaluation when the 
 claims tracking module runs evaluating outpatient events.
  
 IBTRKR5 is being enhanced to pick up prosthetic billable events at time 
 if shipment and to use new CIDC data captured in the evaluation of those 
 events.
  
 IBCCPT is being modified to provide the CPT to diagnosis association for 
 when outpatient events are being looked up.
  
 IBCCPT1 is being added to provide the CPT to diagnosis association for 
 IBCCPT and to evaluate if a certain CPT is billable or not.
  
 IBCD3 is being modified to utilize the enhanced procedure evaluation from 
 IBCU81 and utilize the CPT to diagnosis relationship being provided by 
 IBCCPT.
  
 IBCOPV and IBCOPV1 are being modified to display the reason not billable 
 if one exists for an outpatient encounter in Screen 5, Option 3.
  
 IBCU81 is being modified to provide enhanced billable visit evaluation to 
 determine if the visit is billable or not.
  
 IBCSC5B is being modified to display a billing exemption if specified and 
 automatically populate the diagnosis code from the RECORD OF PROS 
 APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file.
  
 IBCSC5C is being modified to associate the diagnosis codes from the 
 PRESCRIPTION (#52) file if they exist in place of the default diagnosis.  
 If they do not exist then the default will continue to be utilized if it 
 exists.  Additionally if an exemption reason exists in the PRESCRIPTION 
 (#52) file, the first exemption reason found will be displayed.
  
 IBCU7 is being modified to call SROMIN^IBCU74 when a procedure could have 
 anesthesia minutes associated.  Additionally it is being modified to call 
 the new line tag OBSHOUR^IBCU74 to support the observation enhancements 
 included.
  
 IBCU74 is being modified to include a new line tag of SROMIN.  This new 
 line tag will utilize a new Surgery API to look up anesthesia start and 
 stop times.  The time(s) selected will be populated in the minutes field 
 of the bill.  Also a new line tak of OBSHOUR is being added for the 
 observation enhancements included.
