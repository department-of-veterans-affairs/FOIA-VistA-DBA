     The old codes are no longer available:
 
     Old code  New code  Description
 
     36        64        Medicare with Medicaid eligibility
     50        60        Medicare without supplement

     55        67        Veterans Affairs
     56        68        Indian/Public Health Service
 
     The following PRIMARY PAYER AT DX codes have been added:
 
     21 Fee-for-Service
     62 Medicare through Managed Care plan
     63 Medicare with private supplement
 
  2) COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #7-10
 
     The following fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (#160) file:
 
     COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #7  (#160,25.6)
     COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #8  (#160,25.7)
     COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #9  (#160,25.8)
     COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #10 (#160,25.9)
 
  3) SYSTEMIC/SURGERY SEQUENCE (#165.5,15)
 
     The following field has been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file:
 
     SYSTEMIC/SURGERY SEQUENCE (#165.5,15)  
 
     This field is to be used for patients diagnosed on or after 01/01/06.
 
  4) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
       PF Post/Edit Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-POST/EDIT]
       RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-RECURRENCE]
 
     TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5,71)
     CANCER STATUS (#165.573,.02)
 
     An inter-field edit check has been added for TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE
     and CANCER STATUS.  If there is an inter-field problem with these fields
     the following warning messages will appear after the user has edited
     the CANCER STATUS.
  
     WARNING: TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE = 00 (None, disease-free)
              CANCER STATUS must be 1 (No evidence of this tumor)
 
     WARNING: TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE = 70 (Never disease-free)
              CANCER STATUS must be 2 (Evidence of this tumor)
 
     WARNING: TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE = 99 (Unknown if recurred or disease-free)
              CANCER STATUS must be 9 (Unknown if recurred or disease-free)
 
  5) CASEFINDING SOURCE [501] 322-323
 
     To accommodate the above new NAACCR data item the following field has been
     added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file:
 
     CASEFINDING SOURCE (#165.5,21)
 
     This field has been placed in the "Cancer Identification" portion of the
     abstract.  If the patient in question is "in suspense", CASEFINDING SOURCE
     will be stuffed as follows:
 
     If SUSPENSE SOURCE = SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
                        = CYTOPATHOLOGY
                        = ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
     CASEFINDING SOURCE will be stuffed with 20 (Pathology Department Review)
 
     If SUSPENSE SOURCE = PTF FILE
     CASEFINDING SOURCE will be stuffed with 21 (Daily Discharge Review)
 
     If SUSPENSE SOURCE = RADIOLOGY
     CASEFINDING SOURCE will be stuffed with 26 (Diagnostic Imaging/Radiology)
 
     The registrar may edit CASEFINDING SOURCE to something other than the
     stuffed value.
 
  6) TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE (#165.5,1.2)
 
     The definitions for TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE have been expanded.  Two new
     codes have been added:
 
     2  Radiation Treatment or Medical Oncology Centers
     8  Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers
 
     These codes now make it possible to identify outpatient sources that were
     previously grouped under code 1.
 
  7) OTHER STAGE (#165.5,39)
     OTHER TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5,71.4)
 
     The data items OTHER STAGE and OTHER TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE have been
     retired for 2006+ cases.
 
  8) CLASS OF CASE (#165.5,.04) 0
     [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
       [RS Registry Summary Reports]
         [F Follow-Up]
 
     The Commission on Cancer (CoC) has modified the CoC standards for cases
     diagnosed in 2006 or later as follows:
 
     "Registrars in CoC approved facilities will no longer be required to
     provide lifetime follow-up for Class of Case 0 patients.  This means that
     the formula used by CoC facilities to determine follow-up rates will
     exclude Class of Case 0 patients from the numerator and denominator."
 
     In accordance with this decision the following Vista ONCOLOGY change has
     been made:
  
     A new line, line 6, has been added to the FOLLOW-UP RATE FOR ALL PATIENTS
     (LIVING AND DEAD) report.
 
     6.  Less 2006+ Class of Case 0 cases
     
  9) Comorbid/Complication 1  [3110] 675-679
     Comorbid/Complication 2  [3120] 680-684
     Comorbid/Complication 3  [3130] 685-689
     Comorbid/Complication 4  [3140] 690-694
     Comorbid/Complication 5  [3150] 695-699
     Comorbid/Complication 6  [3160] 700-704
     Comorbid/Complication 7  [3161] 717-721
     Comorbid/Complication 8  [3162] 722-726
     Comorbid/Complication 9  [3163] 727-731
     Comorbid/Complication 10 [3164] 732-736
 
     In accordance with the VHA HANDBOOK 1605.1 "PRIVACY AND RELEASE OF
     INFORMATION" the following ICD-9-CM codes will no longer be extracted
     for the NCDB or state downloads.  They will continue to be extracted for
     the VACCR download.
 
     INFECTIOUS AND PARASITC DISEASE ICD-9-CM codes 001.0 - 099.9
 
 10) SEQUENCE NUMBER (#165.5,.06)
 
     If the registrar entered a SEQUENCE NUMBER value of "02" and the first
     malignant or in situ primary was not "01", the program would change the
     first SEQUENCE NUMBER to "01".  This logic was incorrect.  The first
     SEQUENCE NUMBER must have a value of "00" in order to be converted to
     "01".  This has been fixed.
 
 11) PALLIATIVE CARE      (#165.5,12)
     PALLIATIVE CARE @FAC (#165.5,13)
 
     a) The following fields have been renamed:
 
     Old name                       New Name
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     PALLIATIVE PROCEDURE           PALLIATIVE CARE
     PALLIATIVE PROCEDURE @FAC      PALLIATIVE CARE @FAC
 
     b) The following code definitions have been changed for greater clarity:
 
     Old definitions
     ---------------------------------------------
     3  Chemotherapy/hormone therapy/systemic drugs
     5  1, 2, and/or 3 w/o 4
     6  1, 2, and/or 3 with 4
  
     New definitions
     ---------------------------------------------
     3  Systemic tx
     5  Surg, rad, and/or systemic tx w/o pain mgt
     6  Surg, rad, and/or systemic tx w pain mgt
 
 12) PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER (#165.5,148)
     CANCER #1-4                (#165.5,148.1-148.4)
 
     PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER and CANCER #1-4 have been added to the PERSONAL
     DATA section of the [PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)] report.
 
 13) FOLLOW-UP CONTACT (#420)
     FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
       FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ... [ONCO FOLL PROCEDURE MENU]
         AC Add Patient Contact [ONCO FOLL-ADD CONTACT]
 
     The [AC Add Patient Contact] option attempts to automatically add a
     "Patient", "Next of Kin","Other Kin" and "Guardian" FOLLOW-UP CONTACT for
     the patient (in that order).  The order in which these entries are added
     has been changed.  The "Patient" FOLLOW-UP CONTACT will now be added last.
     This change will allow VA FileMan to pre-select the "Patient" entry for
     future edits.  
 
 14) DATE LAST CONTACT (#160,16)
 
     The DATE LAST CONTACT value was not formatting correctly throughout the
     package.  This has been fixed.
 
 15) UTL *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]
       CT Create ACOS Data Download [ONCO #SITE-CREATE ACOS DISK]
       CC Create State/VACCR Data Download [ONCO #STATE DATA DISK]
 
     The time allotted for the user to select the extract capture file has been
     expanded from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
 
 16) GLEASON'S SCORE             (#165.5,623)
     SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 6 (CS) (#165.5,44.6)
     
     For prostate cases if GLEASON'S SCORE = 02-10, SITE-SPECIFIC FACTOR 6 (CS)
     was not being stuffed correctly.  This has been fixed.
 
 17) STA *..Statistical Reports ... [ONCO STAT MENU]
       TX Survival by Treatment [ONCO STAT-SURVIVAL TX]
 
     The [TX Survival by Treatment] option was excluding Hematologic Transplant
     and Endocrine Procedures.  This has been fixed.
