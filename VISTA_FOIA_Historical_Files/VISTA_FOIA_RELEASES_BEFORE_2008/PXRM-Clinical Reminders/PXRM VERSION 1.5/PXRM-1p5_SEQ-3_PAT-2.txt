============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch provides a number of NOIS fixes as well as minor enhancements.
 Detailed descriptions of the changes follow:
  
 1.  Inquiry Option changes:
  
 1.1  All inquiry functions were consolidated into a standard set of
 print templates and routines. Previously all fields in the FINDINGS
 multiple of the REMINDER DEFINITION (#811.9) and REMINDER TERM (#811.5)
 files were printed, even if they were null. Now only non-null fields will
 be printed. This should provide considerably shorter output.
  
 1.2  There was a bug in the taxonomy inquiry that caused the ICD
 Operation/Procedure to be displayed incorrectly. This problem is
 corrected. NOIS:  CIN-0900-42457, FAR-0800-40686, HUN-1000-20744, 
 LAH-0101-60194, PHI-0101-20893, V01-0201-N0005.
  
 1.3  If display of the FINDINGS multiple required more than one page,
 there was no page breaking. Proper page breaking is now done.
  
 2.  Data dictionary changes:
  
 2.1  A number of fields in the REMINDER TAXONOMY (#811.2) and
 REMINDER DEFINITION (#811.9) files were made obsolete when Clinical
 Reminders version 1.5 was released. These fields are deleted by this
 patch, as well as the associated AC and C cross references in file 811.9.
  
 2.2  Due to the way KIDS works, security codes were not properly set on
 the previously existing Clinical Reminders' files when Clinical Reminders
 version 1.5 was installed. The security codes are set to their proper
 values during the post-install.
  
 2.3  A VERSION field was added to CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file (#800)
 to store the current version number of the package. This patch will
 initially set the VERSION field to "1.5".
  
 2.4  Moved the CONDITION field in the REMINDER TERM (#811.5) and REMINDER
 DEFINITION (#811.9) files to a separate node. It now has a maximum length
 of 225 characters instead of 52. Also added the new field CONDITION CASE
 SENSITIVE to the FINDINGS multiple in the same two files. When this has a
 value of "NO" the condition evaluation will not be case sensitive. The
 default is "YES".
  
 2.5  Added the new field EFFECTIVE DATE to the FINDINGS multiple in the
 REMINDER TERM (#811.5) and REMINDER DEFINITION (#811.9) files. A finding
 with a date older than the EFFECTIVE DATE will be treated as false. An
 updated version of the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT reminder definition is
 included. In this definition the EFFECTIVE PERIOD of 2Y is replaced by an
 EFFECTIVE DATE of October 1, 1998. If your site has created a dialog for 
 this reminder you will need to relink it to the dialog after the install
 has finished.
  
 3.  Reminder Evaluation/Clinical Maintenance changes:
  
 3.1  The Computed Finding VA-RACE was not returning the patient's race
 correctly.  This was fixed. NOIS:  CTX-0900-70341, WPB-0700-30774.
  
 3.2  Inpatient medications were not being found for drug findings. This
 was fixed. Drug finding evaluations were made more efficient. This also
 requires Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*54.  NOIS: BRX-0900-12529.
  
 3.3  The code that calls the TIU object expansion was passing a pointer
 to the INSTITUTION file (#4) instead of the required HOSPITAL LOCATION
 file (#44). It was fixed. NOIS:  FGH-0700-32788.
  
 3.4  When there was no match between any of the baseline age ranges and
 the patient's age, making the reminder N/A due to age, the output was
 still appearing in the Clinical Maintenance component even, if IGNORE ON
 N/A was set. This was fixed.
  
 3.5  Locking of expanded taxonomies was made more robust. It no longer
 generates an error when it fails to get a lock. It now produces a "no
 lock" message. NOIS:  CHA-0900-30869.
  
 3.6  Added display of Problem List priorities (acute or chronic) in the
 Clinical Maintenance output. NOIS:  UNY-0900-12325
  
 3.7  The wildcard form of IGNORE ON N/A was not working correctly when the 
 reminder was N/A because the PATIENT COHORT LOGIC evaluated to false. This 
 was fixed. NOIS:  HOU-1100-72053
  
 3.8  A term with more than one drug finding was not always working 
 correctly. This was fixed. NOIS:  SAG-1200-40405
  
 3.9  A change was made in the calculation of the resolution date for 
 complex resolutions. Previously, the most recent date was used. Now, if
 two findings are ANDed, the oldest date is used.  If two findings are
 ORed, the most recent date is used. If the logic is complex, then the date
 is determined by using the above rules. NOIS:  HIN-0900-40246,
 WRJ-0101-11399.
  
 3.10  Previously, when a health factor without a category - which is a 
 required field - was encountered during the reminder evaluation, it caused
 a null subscript error. Now, when a health factor without a category is
 encountered, a warning message will be sent to the user and the reminders
 mailgroup (if the mailgroup is defined). The health factor will be ignored
 in the reminder evaluation and the null subscript errors will be
 eliminated. NOIS:  UNY-0900-10369
  
 3.11  When set, the IGNORE ON N/A field was suppressing the Summary 
 component output in addition to the Maintenance component. It should 
 suppress only the Maintenance component output. It now works correctly.
  
 3.12  The CONDITION field can now be used with all finding types. 
 Previously, all drug findings, radiology procedures, and taxonomies would 
 not allow the use of CONDITION because there is no value for these
 findings. These findings still do not return a value to test against, but
 there is now a standard set of variables that can be used in all
 CONDITIONS.  These variables are:
 PXRMAGE  - patient's age
 PXRMDOB  - patient's date of birth in FileMan format
 PXRMRACE - patient's race (this is the text from the RACE file)
 PXRMSEX  - patient's sex, in the format M^MALE or F^FEMALE
  
 3.13  When there was no reminder frequency the error message "Patient does 
 not meet any age criteria" was being displayed instead of "There is no 
 reminder frequency". NOIS: MAC-0201-61450
  
 3.14  For a historical encounter the internal entry number of the 
 Institution file was being displayed instead of the station number. A 
 change was made to display the station number. NOIS: BUT-0201-22423
  
 4.  Reminder List Option changes:
  
 4.1  When doing a Reminder List, typing a ^ at a prompt caused an
 undefined error instead of taking the user to the previous prompt. 
 This was fixed. NOIS:  HUN-0700-21914, HUN-1100-22185, SFC-1100-60475.
  
 5.  Reminder Dialog changes:
  
 5.1  Dialog elements with sequence numbers >100 created by generating
 dialogs for reminders with >20 findings could not be edited unless the
 sequence number was first changed to <100. This is corrected and
 additional validation is also included to prevent duplicate sequence
 numbers being entered. NOIS: MIA-1100-32057, WPB-0800-30571.
  
 5.2  A dialog group could be entered as a dialog element within itself.
 The result was that stack errors were generated when running the reminder
 dialog containing the group multiple. The REMINDER DIALOG file (#801.41)
 is corrected so that a dialog group may no longer be entered as a dialog
 element within itself. NOIS: SLC-0800-52045 and WAS-0700-21656
  
 5.3  Auto generated dialog elements for contraindicated immunizations
 included an additional prompt - PXRM VISIT DATE - that was not displayed
 in the reminder dialog. This is corrected so that the PXRM VISIT DATE
 prompt displays in the reminder dialog. NOIS: HUN-1000-21282
  
 5.4  Dialog elements for exams occasionally displayed a code value
 instead of the exam name in the encounter window of the reminder dialog.
 This is corrected to show the exam name. NOIS: SPO-1000-52529 
  
 5.5  Editing dialog groups within the CV option of reminder dialogs now 
 uses the same editor as is used for reminder dialogs. Dialog group elements
 may be edited, copied/renamed or deleted. It is no longer necessary to build 
 component dialog elements before building the dialog group. Elements may 
 be created from within the dialog group screen. NOIS: WIC-1000-42229
  
 5.6  A problem was reported by San Diego where the reminder categories in 
 CPRS GUI display the wrong reminders. This is corrected. NOIS: SDC-1000-61815
  
 5.7  If a reminder taxonomy was created after the installation of the
 Clinical Reminders package, selectable codes were not generated for the
 taxonomy dialog. This is changed so that taxonomy dialog edit will
 auto-create the selectable codes if none exist. NOIS: CHA-1100-30888
  
 5.8  If multiple web sites were entered for a reminder and the first 30
 characters of the URLs were the same, only the first of the web sites
 would display in the 'reference information' section of the GUI. This is
 corrected. NOIS: MAC-1100-60409
  
 5.9  The GROUP ENTRY field of the REMINDER DIALOG file (#801.41) used for
 dialog groups is extended to allow a new code:
  
        3       None or One Selection
  
 5.10 The forced value 'PXRM REPEAT CONTRAINDICATED' released with the 
 reminder package had the default value incorrectly set to 'YES'. As a 
 result, the contraindicted field in PCE was not being updated because it
 expects a 1 or 0. This is corrected by patch 2 which sets the default
 value from YES to 1.
  
 5.11 Dialog copy of additional prompts now allows the prompt to be changed 
 into a forced value if the prompt updates PCE or Vitals data. NOIS 
 HVH-1200-11111.
    
 5.12 Dialog edit screens now return to the selection screen from which the 
 edit was initiated. NOIS: PUG-1200-52077
    
 5.13 CPRS Lookup Categories now display sub-categories in display order and 
 show the display sequence number. NOIS: PUG-0101-50004
    
 5.14 Edit template for dialog groups (PXRM EDIT GROUP) now allows
 additional prompts for a group level finding to be excluded from progress 
 note text. NOIS: WAS-0700-21999
  
 6.  Reminder Reports:
 6.1 Reminders Due Report displays 'See below' if future appointments exist 
 outside of the selected location and the 'Display All Future Appointments' 
 option is being used. NOIS: FAR-1000-42813

  Host File:
  ==========
  Due to its size this patch will be available only as a host file.
  The name of the file is PXRM_1_5_2.KID.
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.  The
 preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.  This
 transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
  
 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system; however, we recommend 
 installtion during non-peak hours. The installation time will vary 
 depending on the size of your patient cache. Test sites have experienced 
 installation times between 1 and 35 minutes. During this time your users 
 may experience slow system response.
  
 1. Download the KIDS file PXRM_1_5_2.KID via FTP.  Move the file to the
    appropriate directory on your system.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option:
        Load a Distribution
    When prompted for the file name, type in the directory where you have
    stored the KIDS build, followed by PXRM_1_5_2.KID. An example for
    a VMS system is [ANON]:PXRM_1_5_2.KID.
  
 4. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 5. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (PXRM*1.5*2)
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
    respond 'NO'.
  
 7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'YES'. When prompted to select the
    options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
    GMTS*
    PXRM*
    IBDF PRINT*
    IBDF PRINT FORM
    OR CPRS GUI CHART
    ORS HEALTH SUMMARY
  
                               **Warning** 
    When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
    is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question. If you choose to have KIDs rebuild
    the menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may
    take several hours.
  
    When prompted to select the protocols you would like to place out of
    order, enter the following:
  
    ORS AD HOC HEALTH SUMMARY
    ORS HEALTH SUMMARY
    PXRM PATIENT DATA CHANGE
  
 8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
