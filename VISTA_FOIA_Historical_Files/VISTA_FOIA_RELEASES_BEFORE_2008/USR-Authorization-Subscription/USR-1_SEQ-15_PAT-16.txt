Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
  
 This patch does the following:
  
      1.  Prevents the addition of a user to an inactive class.
          [NOIS LIT-0600-70458, LIT-1299-72456]
      2.  Changes the display sequence from Effective Date to
          Alphabetical when using the option LIST MEMBERSHIP
          BY CLASS.
          [OMA-0300-42030, E3R 14083]
      3.  After accessing approximately 12 or more users with the
          option USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY USER followed by 12 or
          more selections of CHANGE VIEW, the application would quit
          with the error message "Interpreter stack overflow".  This
          is now fixed.
