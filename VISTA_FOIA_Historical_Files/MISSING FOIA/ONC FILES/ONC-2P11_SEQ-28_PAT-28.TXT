 All data dictionary changes/additions have been reviewed and approved by
 the Data Base Administrator.
     
 This patch will implement ICD-O-3 (International Classification of
 Diseases for Oncology 3rd Edition) and fix the STATUS/CAUSE OF DEATH
 internal field edit check.
   
 1) ICD-O-3 IMPLEMENTATION
  
    There are four aspects to the VISTA implementation of ICD-O-3.
   
    a) Data conversion
   
       There are now two histology fields:
   
       HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-2) (165.5,22)   <---current HISTOLOGY field
       HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) (165.5,22.3) <---new HISTOLOGY field
    
       Histology codes prior to 1/1/2001 will maintained in the HISTOLOGY
       (ICD-O-2) field.  In addition, these codes will be converted to
       ICD-O-3 values.  Most of the current ICD-O-2 values will be copied
       as-is to the new HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) field.  Some codes however will
       be converted to the appropriate ICD-O-3 value.
   
       The codes which require conversion fall into the following categories:
  
       a) Terms That Changed Morphology Code
 
       e.g. ICD-O-2 code 8241/1 (CARCINOID TUMOR, ARGENTAFFIN) 
 
            will be converted to
  
            ICD-O-3 code 8240/1 (CARCINOID TUMOR OF UNCERTAIN MALIG POTENTIAL)
 
       b) Terms Changing from Borderline to Malignant
 
       e.g. ICD-O-2 code 8931/1 (ENDOLYMPHATIC STROMAL MYOSIS) 
 
            will be converted to
 
            ICD-O-3 code 8931/3 (ENDOMETRIAL STROMAL SARCOMA, LOW GRADE)
 
       c) Terms Changing from Malignant to Borderline
  
       e.g. ICD-O-2 code 8442/3 (CYSTADENOMA, SEROUS BORDERLINE MALIG) 
 
            will be converted to
 
            ICD-O-3 code 8442/1 (SEROUS CYSTADENOMA, BORDERLINE)
 
       d) Terms Changing from Benign to Borderline
 
       e.g. ICD-O-2 code 8120/0 (TRANSITIONAL CELL PAPILLOMA) 
 
            will be converted to
 
            ICD-O-3 code 8120/1 (UROTHELIAL PAPILLOMA, NOS)
 
       e) Terms Changing from Borderline to Benign
 
       e.g. ICD-O-2 code 8261/1 (VILLOUS ADENOMA) 
  
            will be converted to
  
            ICD-O-3 code 8261/0 (VILLOUS ADENOMA, NOS)
 
    b) Data input
 
       Pre-2001 abstracts
 
       Abstracts with a DATE DX prior to 2001 will be prompted for both
       HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-2) and HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) values.  The user will be
       provided with an HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) default which they may either
       accept or change.  If the HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-2) value is changed, the
       HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) value will be deleted and a new default provided.
 
       2001 or later abstracts
 
       Abstracts with a DATE DX of 2001 or later will only be prompted for
       HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) values.  The HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-2) value will be
       left blank and will be uneditable.
 
    c) Data display
 
       Wherever histology values are displayed, either the ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3
       value will be displayed.  This display will be based on the DATE DX 
       of the primary:
 
       If the DATE DX is before 2001 the ICD-O-2 value will be displayed.
       If the DATE DX is 2001 or after the ICD-O-3 value will be displayed.
 
    d) Internal histology logic 
 
       Throughout the ONCOLOGY package the histology value is interrogated and,
       depending on the its value, certain actions are performed.
 
       e.g. If the abstract is determined to be a LEUKEMIA, the message
       "SYSTEMIC DISEASE - No AJCC coding" appears and the "Stage of
       Disease at Diagnosis" fields are stuffed.
 
       We have updated this internal logic to coincide with the ICD-O-3 
       changes/additions.
 
  2) STATUS           (165.5,.91)
     CAUSE OF DEATH   (160,19)
     STATE DEATH CERT (160,19.1)
 
     If STATUS was "Dead" and CAUSE OF DEATH was blank, the following 
     internal field edit check warning would appear:
 
     WARNING: STATUS = Dead
              CAUSE OF DEATH may not be blank
 
     This warning should only appear if both CAUSE OF DEATH and STATE DEATH
     CERT are blank.  This has been fixed.
   
  3) Required Field Edit Checks
   
     A problem was reported regarding the required field edit checks.
     Several fields are date dependent and are not editable before 
     a specific date.  Before an abstract can be completed, the required
     field edit checks were requiring these fields to be filled in regardless
     of the date.  Therefore, a situation could arise in which certain
     fields are required to be filled in, but they could not be filled in
     because they are not editable.  Because of this, the abstract would not
     be able to be completed.  This discrepency has been fixed.
   
  4) [CC Create State Data Disk]
 
     At the users' request the "Accession year" prompt has been removed from
     the [CC Create State Data Disk] option.  The users may now select a
     multi-year date range.
