Description: 
============

   Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
   release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
   installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
   Implementation Manager for CIRN.
  
  
   ISSUE 1:  The Smart Card project requested to be able to connect to the
   MPI via a tasking off of the direct connect.  A new API has been
   created, $$MPIQQ^MPIFAPI where DFN (IEN of the Patient in the Patient
   (#2) file) is already defined.  DBIA #3300
  
   ISSUE 2:  To support this effort, the existing direct connect code
   needed to be silent.  A new variable MPIFS is checked for existence and
   if it does exist, the call to the direct connect code is silent.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.  Especially since this impacts the DG options
    as well as MPIF options.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
   
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
   
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*14.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes:
  
         [MPIF PAT INACT]                 Inactivate Patient from MPI
         [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]           Single Patient Initialization to MPI
         [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] Display Only Query
  
         [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]      10-10T Registration
         [DG REGISTER PATIENT]            Register a Patient
         [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]           Load/Edit Patient Data
  
    9.  If routines were unmapped in step 3, remap them.
