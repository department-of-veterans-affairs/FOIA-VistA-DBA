 Select the desired entry by number:  (1-2): 2
  
          RECORD1 contains fewer data elements, usually this would indicate
                  that this record would be merged INTO the other.
  
 Determine if these entries ARE or ARE NOT duplicates.
  
   *** WARNING!!!  One or both of these records indicated MULTIPLE BIRTH. ***
   Use caution to ensure that these records are truly duplicates and not
   siblings before proceeding.
