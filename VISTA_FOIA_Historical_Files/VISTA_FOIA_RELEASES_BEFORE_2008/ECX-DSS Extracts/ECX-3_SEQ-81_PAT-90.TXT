  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  =================
  1). HD0000000121885:       Patch ECX*3.0*87 is coded incorrectly
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The new tests added to the DSS Lab Tests file are in mixed case.  All the 
     previous tests are in all were in uppercase.  Site feels this is a 
     deviation from the standard and feels the new tests added should be in all 
     uppercase as well.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The changes were submitted by the Bedford Technical Support Office
     (BTSO) Decision Support System (DSS) Program Office to be implemented
     upon release of the patch.  This patch updates the DSS LAB TESTS
     (#727.2) file:  it updates 12 lab test records.
  
     Resolution Detail:
  
     The new entries that will be added to the DSS LAB TESTS (#727.2) 
     file are:

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
  that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
      2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
         be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
      3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
      4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*90)
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
        d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
      5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*90.
  
      6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//" respond NO.
  
      7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
      8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
         returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
         completion.
  
      9. You may delete the routine ECX3P90P from your production system
         after the patch has been successfully installed and verified.
  
 NOTE:  Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided
        during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install
        File Print option on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation
        and Distribution System.
