Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*152   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*160'

Subject: TIU NEW RPCs

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch provides new TIU remote procedure calls for the CPRS GUI.
  
 RPCS/NOIS Calls:
 ===============
 TIU IS USER INACTIVE?
  
 When a user selects an inactive or DIUSER'd individual as an 
 EXPECTED COSIGNER/ADDITIONAL SIGNER in the CPRS GUI, this RPC will allow the 
 GUI to notify the user if the selected individual has been inactivated or 
 DIUSER'd.
  
 TIU ONE VISIT NOTE?
 NOIS:  TAM-0300-33000 - Problem with ALLOW >1 RECORDS PER VISIT parameter
  
 This RPC will allow the CPRS GUI to follow the document parameter ALLOW >1 
 RECORDS PER VISIT; this will duplicate existing behavior in CPRS List 
 Manager.
  
 TIU HAS AUTHOR SIGNED?
 NOIS:  HOU-0403-71815 - Cosigner not informed that signer has not signed
        CHS-0503-40139 - Difference CPRS GUI vs. CPRS List Manager
  
 This RPC will allow the CPRS GUI to warn the EXPECTED COSIGNER before 
 signing a document that the document has not been signed by the AUTHOR; 
 this will duplicate existing behavior in CPRS List Manager.
  
 Remote Procedures:
 =================
 TIU IS USER INACTIVE?  - Returns boolean value of user's status
 TIU ONE VISIT NOTE?    - Returns boolean value regarding # of notes allowed
                          per visit
 TIU HAS AUTHOR SIGNED? - Returns boolean value related to AUTHOR's 
                          signature

 *TIUPS160 may be deleted after the installation is complete.  It registers 
 the included RPCs with the REMOTE PROCEDURE file for use with the GUI.
