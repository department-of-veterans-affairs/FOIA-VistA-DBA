============

 **************************** NOTE ************************************
 * CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with  *
 * the AR-CoreFLS development team.                                   *
 *                                                                    *
 **********************************************************************
  
 This patch will correct 3 problems discovered very late in the testing
 of patch PRCA*4.5*208 (e-Payments enhancements).
  
    1. When you edit a receipt to change the Electronic Funds Transfer 
       (EFT) associated with the receipt, a hard error <UNDEF> occurred.  
       This patch fixes this problem.
  
    2. If the user is editing a batch in the worklist and uses
       the up caret (^) to exit it, the batch remains marked as 'in use'.
       This patch corrects this situation.
  
    3. A bug was discovered that prevents selection of a worklist entry
       with a line number greater than 99 to be selected for distributing 
       a negative payment within the worklist scratch pad. The limit on 
       line number to select was changed from 99 to 9999 with this patch.
  
    4. A pre-installation routine RCY222PR will look at all entries
       in the EDI LOCKBOX EOB WORKLIST file (#344.49).  If any of
       the batches in the worklist are marked as 'in use', this
       indicator will be reset to 'not in use' to clear up any
       problems caused by the condition described in #2 above.  For
       this reason, no users can be accessing the worklist at the
       time of this install.
