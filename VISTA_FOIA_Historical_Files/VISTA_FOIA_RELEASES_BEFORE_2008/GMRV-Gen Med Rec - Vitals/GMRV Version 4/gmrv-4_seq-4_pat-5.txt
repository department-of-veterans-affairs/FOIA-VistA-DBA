 1) Ref NOIS FAR-1197-41504
    It has been reported that the BMI is displayed as 0.00 for some patients
    in the Clinical Maintenance portion of the health summary.  This is caused
    by vital measurement entries in the GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) File
    that have 'n' stored where the height measurement was not repeated for the
    day of the measurement. The routine GMRVED3 has been modified so that 'n'
    is no longer stored in the measurement record when entering data via the
    [GMRV V/M ENTRY MENU] Vitals/Measurement Data Entry option, and a 
    measurement is omitted.
