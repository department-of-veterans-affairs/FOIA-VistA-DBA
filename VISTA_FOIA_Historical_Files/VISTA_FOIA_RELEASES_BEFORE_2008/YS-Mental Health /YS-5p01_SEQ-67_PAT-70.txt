Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues in the Mental Health software. 
 
  1. Patients who take the BECK SCALE FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION (BSI) test on
     the Mental Health Assistant are presented with questions that do not 
     make sense when compared to their previous answers. For example, the 
     patient says that he/she is not suicidal but the test asks him/her 
     detailed questions about the last attempt and possible future attempts
     at suicide.  The skip logic for the BSI was not included in MHA.
     The skip logic for the BSI using the List Manager software worked
     properly. This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10.
     CLE-0303-41699
 
  2. New scales have been added to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
     Inventory-2 (MMPI2).  The new scales are the Restructured Clinical
     (RC) Scales for the MMPI2.  The RC scales are based on recent factor
     analyses of the existing Clinical Scales, and are intended to be used
     as aids in the interpretation of the Clinical Scale profile.  The names
     of the 9 RC scales are as follows (note that there is no RC5 scale):
     RCd: Demoralization
     RC1: Somatic Complaints
     RC2: Low Positive Emotions
     RC3: Cynicism
     RC4: Antisocial Behavior
     RC6: Ideas of Persecution
     RC7: Dysfunctional Negative Emotions
     RC8: Aberrant Experiences
     RC9: Hypomanic Activation
 
     Note:
     The set of MMPI2 scales that are scored and the order in which they are 
     presented has been changed to be consistent with the recommendations of 
     the test authors and publisher. 
 
     The PTSD-Schlenger scale is no longer scored.
  
 
  3. Three new psychological tests have been added to the MH INSTRUMENT 
     (#601) file.  The new depression measures include the 20-item version
     Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), the Center 
     For Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 5 Items (CESD5) and the 
     Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).  The PHQ9 is based on 
     the 9 DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode, and test results
     include both the number of criteria met as well as indication of 
     whether the criteria for MDE are met.  All can now be administered 
     using the Mental Health Assistant.
 
  4. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed (AUDC) has been
     revised to meet the new Alcohol Screening Performance Measure issued by
     the Office of Quality and Performance.
 
  5. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed Revised (AUDCR)
     has been made non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the 
     MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).
 
  6. An entry to the COPYRIGHT HOLDER file (#601.3) has been made for the new
     psychological test PHQ9.
 
  7. The instrument Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEOPI) in the MH
     MULTIPLE SCORING file (#601.6), which allows the user to score
     multiple instruments, has been edited to correctly return scale 
     scores to be displayed on the Test Results in the Mental Health
     Assistant (MHA).
 
     Also corrected within the NEOPI is item #86 which read "When I'm under 
     a great deal of stress, sometimes I fell like I'm going to pieces.".  
     Item #86 now reads as "When I'm under a great deal of stress, sometimes
     I feel like I'm going to pieces." 
 
 
  8. When running option List Test and Interviews [YSMLST] from programmer
     prompt...%DSM-E-ENDOFILE, end of file encountered.  This error has been 
     corrected.
     EKH-0698-41771
 
  9. The instrument Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI3) in the 
     MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) ITEM NUMBER field (#1) entry #41 which read
     "I've done a number of stupid things on impulse that needed up causing 
     me great trouble.". Item Number #41 now reads as "I've done a number of
     stupid things on impulse that ended up causing me great trouble."
     CTX-1003-71717
 
     Also within the MCMI3 the TEST SCALE NUMBER field (#16) SCALE NAME
     sub-field (#.05) for entries 12, 14 and 15 which read:
 
           6B Aggressive/Sadistic
           8A Passive-Aggressive
           8B Self-Defeating
 
     SCALE NAME entries 12, 14 and 15 now read as:
 
           6B Sadistic
           8A Negativistic
           8B Masochistic
