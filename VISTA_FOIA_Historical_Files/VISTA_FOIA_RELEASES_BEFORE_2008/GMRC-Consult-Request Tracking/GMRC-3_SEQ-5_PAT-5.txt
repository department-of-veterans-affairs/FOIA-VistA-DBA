Description: 
============

 Y
  Note: This patch should only be installed at sites running CPRS.
   
  GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
  ==================== 
  Modifications are made to the determination of notification recipients.
  Alerts for a discontinued consult will now be sent to the ordering
  provider as well as the update users for the consult service configured
  to get notifications.
   
  Modifications were made to support procedure ordering in the GUI and List
  Manager interfaces for CPRS. Only those procedures entered in the new
  PROCEDURE TYPE multiple field in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file are
  orderable in CPRS. 
   
  Modifications have been made to enhance and support the Edit/resubmit
  actions for cancelled consults via List Manager and GUI CPRS. This
  includes capture of the activity log and sending notifications of the 
  resubmitted consult to the appropriate service update users.
   
  
   
  The post-installation routine for this patch loads procedures (GMRCR
  Prefixed protocols) in the Protocol file into the PROCEDURE TYPE multiple
  field in file 123.5.  This is based on the service currently associated
  with the procedure in the PROTOCOL (#101) file.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   This patch should be loaded as soon as possible after CPRS V1 has
   been successfully loaded.  It should be run before letting users back on
   the system after the CPRS V1 install. The installation will take about 5
   minutes.  If CPRS V1 has been installed, please install this patch at
   non-peak hours.
   
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
   2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation menu.
   
   3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the install name:
      GMRC*3.0*5
   
   4. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
   
   5. When prompted for the device to which to print the install, selection
      of a printer is recommended to assist in the post-install
      instructions.
   
   
   POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===============================
   
   1. After the Post-installation routine has completed:  Review the
      text created from the Install Build Print.  A summary count at the
      end of the install build print will indicate if any Protocol
      definitions need to be reviewed. If a review is indicated, the
      protocol was not successfully added to the PROCEDURE TYPE (#101)
      field of the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file. This can be corrected by
      using the Setup Request Services option.
  
   2. Changes to the service performing a procedure should no longer be
      done in the protocol file. The procedure should be added to the
      appropriate service entry in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file, in
      the PROCEDURE TYPE field #101. This should be done using the Setup
      Request Services option.
  
   3. After successful installation of GMRC*3*5, the post-install routine
      GMRCYP5 may be deleted from your system.
