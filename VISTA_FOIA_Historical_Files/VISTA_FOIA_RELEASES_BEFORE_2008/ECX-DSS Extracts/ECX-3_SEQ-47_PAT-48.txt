 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*48):
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*48.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO. 
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
 6.  Delete the routine, ECX348PT, from your production system once the
     installation has successfully completed.
