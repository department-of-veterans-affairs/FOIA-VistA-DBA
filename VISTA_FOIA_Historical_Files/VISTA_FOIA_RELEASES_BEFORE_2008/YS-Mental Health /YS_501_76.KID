"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",1,0)
Following are some questions to see what interests you have and
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",2,0)
how you feel about things.  On most items there are no "right" or
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",3,0)
"wrong" answers because people have the right to their own views.
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",4,0)
All you have to do is answer what is true for you.
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",5,0)
    
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",6,0)
As you reply to the questions keep these four things in mind:
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",7,0)
    
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",8,0)
1.  Give only answers that are true for you.  It is best to say what
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",9,0)
you really think.
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",10,0)
   
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",11,0)
2.  Don't spend too much time thinking over each question.  GIVE THE
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",12,0)
FIRST, NATURAL ANSWER AS IT COMES TO YOU.  Of course, the questions
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",13,0)
are too short to give you all the information you might like, but
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",14,0)
give the best answer you can under the circumstances.
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",15,0)
   
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",16,0)
3.  Answer EVERY question one way ore the other.  Don't skip any.
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",17,0)
   
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",18,0)
4.  You should answer the "a" or "c" answer most of the time.  Use
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",19,0)
the "b" answer only when you feel you have to, because neither "a"
"DATA",601,1,"Q",1,"I",20,0)
nor "c" seems to be right for you.

The MMPI-2 contains a number of items whose content may indicate the

presence of psychological problems when endorsed in the deviant direction.
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,3,0)
These "critical items", developed for use in clinical settings, may provide
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,4,0)
an additional source of hypotheses about the respondent.  However, caution
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,5,0)
should be used in interpreting critical items since responses to single
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,6,0)
items are very unreliable and should not be treated as scores on full-length
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,7,0)
scales--for example, an individual could easily mismark or misunderstand
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,8,0)
a single item and not intend the answer given.  The content of the items and
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,9,0)
the possibility of misinterpretation make it important to keep the test
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,10,0)
results strictly confidential.  Special caution should be exercised when
