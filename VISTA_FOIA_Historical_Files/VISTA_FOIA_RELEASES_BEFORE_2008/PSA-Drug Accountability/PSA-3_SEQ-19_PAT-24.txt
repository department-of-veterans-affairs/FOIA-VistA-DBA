Subject: ADDING INVOICE PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  When invoices are added during processing, the DIC call used should be
  a FILE^DICN. Plus the lookup variable is set to look for an exact match.
  Order numbers such as "(B)123244556" cannot be added to the DRUG 
  ACCOUNTABILITY ORDER file (#58.811). This patch corrects the call.
