This file contains a description of all of the interfaces with other packages.
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",6,0)
The form will invoke the proper interface routines by doing a lookup on
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",7,0)
this file and then invoking the routine by indirection. The INPUT VARIABLE
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",8,0)
fields are for documentation purposes and to verify that the proper
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",9,0)
variables are defined. Data will be exchanged between the encounter form
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",10,0)
utilities and other packages by putting the data in a predefined location.
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",11,0)
The first part of the subscript is always be ^TMP("IB",$J,"INTERFACES".
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",12,0)
For output routines, but not selection routines, the fourth subscript is
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",13,0)
be the patient DFN. The next subscript is the name of the Package
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",14,0)
Interface. For single valued data and record valued data there is no
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",15,0)
additional subscript. For interfaces returning a list there is one
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",16,0)
additional subscript level, the number of the item on the list. For
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",17,0)
word processing type data the data will be in FM word-processing format,
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",18,0)
i.e., the final subscripts will be ...1,0),...2,0),...3,0), etc.
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",19,0)
these items of data can have its own entry in the Package Interface file,
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",20,0)
but by using the same entry point there is a savings because all of the
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",21,0)
data on that node can be obtained at once. The routines that invoke the
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",22,0)
entry point keep track of the entry points already invoked so they are
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",23,0)
not repeated.
