Subject: AMBCARE INPATIENT TRANSMISSION - DG

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch addresses service request, NSR #20031109, which came as a 
 recommendation from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Physician 
 Productivity and staffing advisory group to add CPT-4 Inpatient Code 
 Transmittal to Austin.
     
 Currently, only outpatient data are transmitted to Austin.  This patch made 
 modifications that will now allow inpatient encounters to be transmitted 
 via the Ambulatory Care transmission to the National Patient Care Database
 in Austin. 
   
 Routine VAFHLPV1 was modified to:-
   o   add the value "I" for inpatient encounters to the PATIENT CLASS 
       (Sequence 2) on the Patient Visit Segment (PV1).
   o   populate ADMISSION DATE/TIME into the ENCOUNTER DATE/TIME field
       (Sequence 44) on the Patient Visit Segment (PV1) for inpatient 
       encounters.
 
 DBIA 1575 was granted to Registration from Scheduling for use of API 
 $$INPATENC^SCDXUTL.

 WAS-1104-20651  Receiving undefined error
 Sites reported receiving an undefined error when running the DG THIRD 
 PARTY REIMBURSEMENT report option.  This error does not always occur.  It 
 is only evident when there is a principal diagnosis stored at the 10th 
 piece of node 70 in the ^DGPT file. This is the PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS field 
 #79 of PTF file #45 and contains the diagnosis responsible for the 
 patient's greatest length of stay.
 
 Solution
 There was a typo at line DG3PR2+18^DG3PR2 where the variable DXDAT was 
 referenced instead of DGDAT.  This problem was correct.
