Subject: TIU Surgery Addenda Cleanup Utility and Updates

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch contains several updates related to TIU*1.0*112  TIU/SURGERY 
 INTERFACE as well as a new List Manager utility to associate UNKNOWN 
 ADDENDA to OPERATION REPORTs that may have occurred prior to the 
 installation of TIU*1.0*187  TIU Surgery Fixes.
 
 As per the CPRS Clinical Workgroup, from a meeting 09/09/04, the following 
 line will now be displayed for all UNCOSIGNED notes viewed via the CPRS 
 GUI immediately following the header information but before the body text:
 
                         *** NOT YET COSIGNED ***
 
 For OPERATION REPORTs viewed via both the CPRS GUI and List Manager 
 interfaces, the caption AUTHOR or DICTATED BY is replaced with SURGEON.  To 
 maintain data consistency with the assigned Surgical Case, all uploaded
 OPERATION REPORTs will not accept changes to the AUTHOR/DICTATOR (#1202) or 
 the EXPECTED COSIGNER (#1208).  Changes to either of these fields will 
 require the change to be made via the surgery package so that a new stub can 
 be created with the desired individuals.

 Post-Install Instructions:
 =========================
 After TIU*1.0*173 has been installed, the following menu option should be 
 available on the Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) Menu [TIU MAIN 
 MENU MGR]:  UNKNOWN Addenda Cleanup.
 
 All UNKNOWN (parentless) ADDENDA that fall within the user entered date 
 range will be displayed.
 
 After the date range has been entered and the search completes, the addenda
 that have been found will be displayed.  The user may select a single 
 document (#), multiple documents(#,#,#), range of documents(#-#), or
 combination (#,#,#-#) of documents to attach to a single parent.
 
 The following actions are available on the UNKNOWN ADDENDA display:
 
 Browse a Document  - View a selected document (if authorized)
 Change View        - Modify search criteria
 Detailed Display   - View detailed display of a document (if authorized)
 Find Parent        - Find available OPERATION REPORTS to assign as parent
 
 ** Be sure to verify any addenda before attaching to a parent document. **
 ** Many addenda are duplicates of the original OPERATION REPORT and     **
 ** may be deleted once they're verified as UNSIGNED COPIES of the       **
 ** original OPERATION REPORT.                                           **
 
 Since parent documents may fall outside the first date range, the action 
 Find Parent will prompt the user for another date range to search for 
 eligible OPERATION REPORTs.  Only OPERATION REPORTs with the same 
 patient(s) of the previously selected ADDENDA will be displayed in the 
 list.
 
 The following actions are available on the OPERATION REPORTs display:
 
 Browse a Document  - View a selected document (if authorized)
 Change View        - Modify search criteria
 Detailed Display   - View detailed display of a document (if authorized)
 Attach to Parent   - Attach the currently selected addendum to one
                      OPERATION REPORT
 
 Only one document may be selected as the potential parent to the previously 
 selected ADDENDUM/ADDENDA.
 
 Users may NOT attach addenda to a parent OPERATION REPORT with a different 
 patient or an OPERATION REPORT whose ENTRY DATE/TIME falls after the 
 addenda.
 
 Once a parent document has been selected, a confirmation screen will 
 display the selected addenda and parent information and prompt the user to 
 begin attaching the documents.
 
 After the utility attempts to associate the addenda with a parent OPERATION 
 REPORT, the user will be returned to the initial List Manager display with 
 successful associations being listed under the "Parent" column showing the 
 TIU Document # of the parent that has been assigned.  These documents will 
 no longer appear once the current session is closed or a new search is 
 initiated via the CHANGE VIEW option.
