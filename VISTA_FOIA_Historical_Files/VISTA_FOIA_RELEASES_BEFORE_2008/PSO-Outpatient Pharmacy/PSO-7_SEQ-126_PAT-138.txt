Associated patches: (v)PSO*7*120   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*138'

Subject: LASER LABEL UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 1. During testing of PSO*7*120, it was discovered that there was a 
 problem with the entry of 'y' at the prompt "Print adhesive portion of 
 label only? ". The lowercase 'y' was being treated as a NO response. This 
 patch corrects this problem by handling either upper or lower case YES, 
 YE or Y as yes.
  
 2. A problem was found with the documentation of the Integration 
 Agreements in routine PSOLLU2. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 3. In preparation for future enhancements to language handling within 
 label print, a change was necessary to allow the bottle label information 
 to print in a different language from the one on the pharmacy fill 
 document. This patch makes this change.
  
 4. The final contract award for the laser label stock made a slight 
 modification to the location of the perforation above the fill document. 
 This patch makes the modification to the printer setup routine to 
 accommodate this change.
  
 5. During internal testing, it was discovered that there is a problem 
 with the creation of the CONTROL CODES field (#55) of the TERMINAL TYPE 
 file (#3.2) using the utility PSOLLU2. If the person running the routine 
 didn't have the '@' for FileMan access, the entries were not correctly 
 built. This patch corrects this problem by checking the FileMan access of 
 the user before proceeding.
