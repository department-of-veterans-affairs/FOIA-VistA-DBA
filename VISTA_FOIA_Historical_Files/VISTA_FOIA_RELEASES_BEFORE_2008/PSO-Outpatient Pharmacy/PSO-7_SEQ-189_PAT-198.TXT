Subject: PMI INFO SENT IN NTE SEGMENT VIA OPAI

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following three problems.
  
 1) The Outpatient Pharmacy Automated Interface (OPAI) is creating an HL7
 NTE segment with Patient Medication Instructions (PMI) information which
 contains words that are run together with no spaces.
  
 2) The PSO MANAGEMENT REPORTS are not including released prescriptions
 with release dates with no times.
  
 3) The OPAI is creating an HL7 NTE6 segment with Drug Allergy
 Indications that is partially formatting this segment.
  
  
 1. HD0000000068539/  Information sent to Scriptpro thru OPAI
    TNV-1204-31174   
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the NTE segment is created, the interface pulls that data from a 
 file where the records are stored in pieces and reassembles these pieces 
 to create the NTE segment.  When connecting the pieces together, words 
 sometimes get put together as one word making it unreadable when printed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Insert spaces between the words while assembling the NTE HL7 message, 
 where needed.
  
  
 2. HD68400/       PSO MANAGEMENT REPORTS NOT COUNTING INTERFACE RX'S
    OKL-1104-70598, HD111756, HD87491
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The PSO Management reports are inaccurate and missing records released 
 by Optifill machines.  Optifill machines do not report the time that a 
 drug was released.  The PSO Management Compilers are skipping any 
 prescriptions that have been released that do not contain times with the 
 date/time released information.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Alter the compiler routines to also include these prescription records 
 that only have a release date without the time.
  
  
 3. HD0000000069007/     Optifil HL7 Message Creation Problems
    BIR-0305-30128
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An invalid segment error occurs when the HL7 two way interface (OPAI) 
 creates the NTE6 segment (Drug Allergy Indications).  This segment is 
 missing the beginning pieces that identify it as NTE6 segment.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct the routine that creates this segment to insure it will begin 
 with the segment identifier.
