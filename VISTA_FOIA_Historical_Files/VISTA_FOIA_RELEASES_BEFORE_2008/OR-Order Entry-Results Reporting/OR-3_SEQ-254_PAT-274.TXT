 PATCH DESCRIPTION
 =================
 This patch provides updates for VistAWeb 7.0.0.
  
 This patch adds one or more columns to the following reports in the OR/RR 
 Report (101.24) file.
 ORRPW ALLERGIES ADV - 1032
 ORRPW ORDERS CURRENT - 1100
 ORRPW PHARMACY ALL OUT - 1079
 ORRP SURGERIES - 48
 ORRPW DOD ALLERGIES ADV - 1137
 ORRPW HDR ALLERGIES - 1551
 ORRPW HDR PHARMACY OUT - 1553
 ORRPW DOD PHARM ALL OUT - 1105
  
 Four extract routines are updated to populate the newly added columns 
 above.  This will make more details available on some of the VistAWeb
 reports.
  
 In addition, an entry is made to the REMOTE APPLICATION (8994.5) file 
 to add the VistAWeb authentication information.  This will enable VistAWeb 
 7.0.0 to authenticate remote users using the Broker Security Enhancement,
 and discontinue use of the CAPRI style authentication.
