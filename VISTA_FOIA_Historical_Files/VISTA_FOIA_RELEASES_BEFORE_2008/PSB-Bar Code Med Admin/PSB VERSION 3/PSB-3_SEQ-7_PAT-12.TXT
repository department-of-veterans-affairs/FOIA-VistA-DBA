Subject: NO WARNING FOR LATE OR 2ND DOSE WITHIN MINUTES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When administering an early or late Pharmacy ordered IVPB, a warning is 
 issued to the administrator letting them know how many minutes early or 
 late the dose being administered is according to the time scheduled by 
 the pharmacist.  If the IVPB is administered and another IVPB
 is attempted to be administered immediately after the original IVPB,
 a warning will be displayed to the administrator letting them know that 
 an IVPB was just administered and how long ago.  In order to be allowed 
 to administer this dose, the software requires the administrator to supply
 a reason for this duplicate after which the second dose will be permitted.
 At this time, this process is working as expected as long as the dose 
 being administered is a Pharmacy ordered dose.  If, however, the dose
 being administered happens to be from a ward stock and the ward stock is 
 early or late or right after the original dose was administered, there is 
 no warning and the dose is permitted to be administered.

  Overview of NOIS Message:
  =========================
  Problem: NOIS BUT-0904-22248
  When administering an early or late Pharmacy ordered IVPB, a warning is
  issued to the administrator letting them know how many minutes early or 
  late the dose being administered is according to the time scheduled by 
  the pharmacist.  If the IVPB is administered and another IVPB
  is attempted to be administered immediately after the original IVPB,
  a warning will be displayed to the administrator letting them know that 
  an IVPB was just administered and how long ago.  In order to be allowed 
  to administer this dose, the software requires the administrator to 
  supply a reason for this duplicate after which the second dose will be
  permitted.  At this time, this process is working as expected as long as
  the dose being administered is a Pharmacy ordered dose.  If, however, the
  dose being administered happens to be from a ward stock and the ward
  stock is early or late or right after the original dose was administered,
  there is no warning and the dose is permitted to be administered.
  
  Resolution:  
  A Ward Stock dose will be treated just like a Pharmacy ordered dose where
  before allowing an early, late or second dose to be administered a 
  warning will be issued and will require the administrator to supply a 
  reason for the dose before the dose will be permitted to be administered.
