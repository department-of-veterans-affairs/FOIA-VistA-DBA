Subject: CORRECTION OF SC VET AWAITING APPT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem with the SC Veterans Awaiting Appointments 
 [SCRPW SC VETS AWAITING APPTS] option.  Patients with no data in the DATE
 ENTERED INTO FILE field .097 of Patient file #2 are erroneously included 
 on this report.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 BIL-0403-32327 SC VETS AWAITING APPOINTMENT
  
   Problem:
   ------------
   The problem with the SC Veterans Awaiting Appointments option was that the 
   routine included patients with no DATE ENTERED INTO FILE information in  
   Patient file #2.
  
   Resolution:
   ------------
   A modification will be made to the routine SCRPW63. The variable (SDLVDT) 
   which holds the last valid date for the patient was not being reset 
   causing the inconsistencies with the report output.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours but because an option
 will be out of service during the installation process, it is suggested 
 that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 
 1 minute.
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
      
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
    from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*357)
     
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
     
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     SD*5.3*357.
     
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//', respond NO
     
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES
  
    When prompted to select the options you would like to place out 
    of order, enter the following:
  
    SCRPW SC VETS AWAITING APPTS
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation 
    has run to completion.
