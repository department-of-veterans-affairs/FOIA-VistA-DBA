Subject: NPI extract corrections

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 Kernel patch, XU*8.0*452 contains updates to the NPI Extract released as
 patch XU*8.0*438. NPI numbers and associated demographics are pulled from
 the INSTITUTION file (#4), the NEW PERSON file (#200), and the IB NON/OTHER
 VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) from each VA Medical Center.  The
 extracted data is aggregated and moved to a secure database that can be
 accessed by the CBO.  The extracted data is formatted into an encrypted
 and password protected Excel spreadsheet and sent to the payers via a CD.
 This Excel data file can then be loaded into the NPI Crosswalk file at
 every payer, thus enabling them to crosswalk the new NPI to a provider's
 legacy payer ID.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
  
 After this patch is installed, the IRM will need to schedule option XUS
 NPI EXTRACT through TaskMan to run ONCE and after that as requested by CBO.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000178434
 HD0000000179641
 HD0000000179645
 HD0000000179510
 HD0000000178844
  
 1. Remedy #178434:
    If a Federal Tax ID could not be positively matched with an Institution
    then an UNDEF error would occur. This issue has now been corrected so
    that the extract will continue with a blank Federal Tax ID.
  
 2. Remedy #179641:
    If an Institution was associated with a Pharmacy but that Pharmacy was
    related to a CBOC instead of directly to the VAMC then that Institution
    would not be extracted. This issue has now been corrected so that all
    Institutions associated with Pharmacies will be extracted.
  
 3. Remedy #179645:
    If the extract was run on a support or test system and that system was
    setup to send MailMan messages then that test data would be used as
    part of the aggregate file. A flag has been added to differentiate data
    from pre-prod (support) and test accounts from live production data.
  
 4. Remedy #179510:
    If a particular record in the Person Class entries for a record in the
    NEW PERSON file was missing then an UNDEF error would occur in routine
    XUSTAX when trying to enter that person as a provider on an IB claim.
    This issue has now been corrected to check for this missing data and
    handle it accordingly.
  
 5. Remedy# 178844:
    Part of the post-install routine on patch XU*8.0*416 did not run. This
    resulted in several new entries in the PERSON CLASS file (#8932.1) not
    being loaded and the pointers to those entries from the INSTITUTION
    file (#4) not being set. This patch runs the remaining portions of
    that post-install routine.

 Site must schedule the XUS NPI EXTRACT REPORT Process
  
 The site's IRM personnel perform these steps.
  
 There is an option that should be scheduled to run once, the XUS
 NPI EXTRACT REPORT [XUS NPI EXTRACT] option. You can schedule the
 NPI Extract through TaskMan. This background job performs the task of
 searching through the INSTITUTION file (#4), the NEW PERSON file (#200),
 and the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) to locate records
 with an NPI and forwards an email containing those records to a pre-
 determined email address.
  
 Note: If you already scheduled this option when installing patch XU*8*438
 and it has not yet run then you do not need to schedule it again.
  
 Note: Assistance from a system manager may be required to schedule this
 option.
  
  1.      From the TaskMan Management menu, select Schedule/Unschedule
          Options.
  2.      Schedule the option, XUS NPI EXTRACT REPORT.
  3.      Select the time the option should run.
