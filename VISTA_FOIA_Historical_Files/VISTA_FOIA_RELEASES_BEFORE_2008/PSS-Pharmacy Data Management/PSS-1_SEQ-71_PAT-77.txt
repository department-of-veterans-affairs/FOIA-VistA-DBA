Subject: SYNONYM LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the SYNONYM field (#.01) of the SYNONYM multiple
 (#50.1) in the DRUG file (#50). Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA)
 uses the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) format for barcodes. The GTIN has
 a 14-digit data structure, which is used within the Uniform Code
 Council/European Article Numbering (UCC/EAN) system for unique
 identification of trade items worldwide. This patch corrects the problem
 in which scanned GTIN entries stored in the SYNONYM field were not
 recognized when doing a lookup on entries within the DRUG file (#50).
  
 Note: In order to have the lookup with GTIN work correctly, sites
       currently running the BCMA package must also install the BCMA
       patch PSB*2*30.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation takes
 less than two minutes. This patch can be installed at any time.
 Installation of this patch should NOT be queued. Installation will take
 about two minutes.
  
   1. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select

         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*77.

      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 1, they should be
      returned to the set once the installation has run to completion.
