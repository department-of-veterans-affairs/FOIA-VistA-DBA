 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch is Phase III of the Fee Basis part of the HIPAA Confidential  
 Communication (CC) project. 
  
 There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following:
 ------------------------------------
 1) This patch modifies the Fee Basis software to allow it to send veteran
 MRA messages to Central Fee at the AAC using  the new format, which
 includes patients' Confidential Communication Address data. Some other
 fields also have been changed in the new veteran MRA format to send more
 accurate information regarding a patient's name and permanent address.
 This patch is going to be released nationally only after the new software 
 is installed at the AAC, which allows Central Fee to accept the new MRA
 messages. 
 2) This patch modifies the Fee Basis software to allow the Fee Basis user
 to edit the patient's Permanent Address using the new Registration API
 that allows one to populate CITY and COUNTY  fields based on ZIP code.

 FBAACO0 
 This routine has been modified to use a new Registration API to edit an 
 patient's permanent address. Integration agreement #4198 PATIENT ADDRESS

 FBAAV4
 This routine has been modified to implement a new format for veteran's 
 MRA. The new format includes changes for patient name, permanent
