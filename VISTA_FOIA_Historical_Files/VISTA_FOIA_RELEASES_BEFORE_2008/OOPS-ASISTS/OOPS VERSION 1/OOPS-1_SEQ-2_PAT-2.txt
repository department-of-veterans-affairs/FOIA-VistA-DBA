============

 This patch contains the following problem resolutions.  All data dictionary

  1) ASISTS Union Menu
       Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses
 
     a) The user will no longer be prompted for "Cases to be included".
        The log output will only include employees and volunteers.

        involved? Yes//".  The log output will not display the names of
        the persons involved.

     The following change pertains to the following two options:
 
       Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses

     When the user answers "No" to the above prompt, in addition to the
     person's name, the Occupation Code and Cost Center/Organization Code
     will now also be suppressed.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 
  This patch can be installed with users on the system.
   
  Installation will take less than one minute.
   
  1. Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
     section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this
     time.
   
  2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
   
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OOPS*1.0*2).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any of the other changes.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines and
         options).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
   
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     OOPS*1.0*2.
   
  6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
     and Protocols? YES//" respond "NO".
   
  7. If any routines were unmapped as a part of step 1, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
 
  8. This patch includes options.  You will be asked to rebuild Menu Trees
     at installation time.
