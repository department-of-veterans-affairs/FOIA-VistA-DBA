Subject: Patient Representative Database Rollup

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch, along with QAC*2*4 will create a daily rollup of Patient 
 Representative data to Austin.  It is being distributed in a hostfile,
 QAC_2_4.KID, which contains the two patches involved.  In QAQ*1.7*6 two
 new fields are being created in file #740 (QUALITY ASSURANCE SITE
 PARAMETERS file).  The first field is #753, QAC LAST RECORD, which will
 hold the last QAC record sent to the national database.  The second field
 is #754, QAC ROLLUP TASK, which will store the Taskmanager number of the
 current job for this rollup.  This will enable the routine to check the
 task list for copies already on the future task list and avoid multiple
 copies on the list.
  
 Please refer to the NPM document for QAC*2*4 for the Installation
 instructions/combined discription for these two patches.
