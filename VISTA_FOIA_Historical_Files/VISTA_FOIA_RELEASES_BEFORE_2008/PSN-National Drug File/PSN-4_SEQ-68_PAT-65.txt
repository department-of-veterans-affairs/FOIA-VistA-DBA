Subject: DEA/VA PKI PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in 
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
 project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
 Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
 entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
 signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
 packages were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
  
 The National Drug File data update patches PSN*4*64 and PSN*4*66 assign a
 CS Federal Schedule to controlled substances and identify controlled
 substances as narcotics or non-narcotics by populating the CS FEDERAL
 SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
  
 This is the NDF patch that provides the following new functionalities:
  
 1. This patch includes the Data Dictionary (DD) changes for CS FEDERAL
 SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) 
  
 2. When using the Merge National Drug File Data Into Local File 
 [PSNMRG] option, the software will now check to see if the CS FEDERAL
 SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) has data and the DEA,
 SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) does not have data. If both
 are true, then the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) will be populated with the
 DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code mapped to the corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE
 code using the following table:
  
                          CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE     DEA, SPECIAL HDLG Code
 Schedule I narcotics            1                        1
 Schedule II narcotics           2                       2A
 Schedule II non-narcotics      2n                       2C
 Schedule III narcotics          3                       3A
 Schedule III non-narcotics     3n                       3C
 Schedule IV narcotics           4                        4
 Schedule V narcotics            5                        5
  
 3. This patch ensures that the newly populated CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field
 (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) is also included as part of the
 National Drug file details in Inquire to National Files [PSNACT], NDF
 Info From Your Local Drug File [PSNRPT], Verify Matches [PSNVFY] and
 Verify Single Match [PSNVER] options.
  
 4. When using Rematch / Match Single Drugs [PSNDRUG] option, if the CS
 FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) and the DEA,
 SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) have a discrepancy, then
 this patch displays a warning message, "The CS Federal Schedule associated
 with this drug in the VA Product file represents a DEA, Special Handling
 code of XX", where XX is the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code mapped to the
 corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code using the table listed under item
 2.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be installed when users are not using the NDF package. 
 Installation will take less than 5 minute. There are no scheduling
 restrictions or recommendations for this patch.
   
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:

     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*65.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
