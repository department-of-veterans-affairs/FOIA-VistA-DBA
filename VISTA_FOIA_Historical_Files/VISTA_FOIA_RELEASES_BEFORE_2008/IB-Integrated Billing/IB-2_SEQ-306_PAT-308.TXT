Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented 
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing 
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 These PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS On/Off 
 Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".  The ability for 
 the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at the 
 appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 patch.

 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Functional Description
 ======================
 IB*2*308 provides an enhancement for all VA sites regardless of the status
 of the PFSS switch.  Currently when a pharmacist releases a prescription
 and the patient is potentially receiving his first copayment at the
 facility but he has received care at other VA facilities, an on the fly
 query is done to remote facilities to obtain present year copayment 
 information, placing the pharmacist on hold while the query is 
 accomplished.  With the installation of this patch the Integrated Billing
 (IB) software will attempt to accomplish the query in the background via a
 tasked job right after the pharmacist finishes the prescription prior to
 release.  Assuming the query was successful; at time of release the local
 VistA system will have the data already and not need to place the 
 pharmacist on hold.
  
 Additionally a new option is included in this patch to allow sites to 
 extract Reasonable Charges (RC) data from the Charge Master module of
 Integrated Billing.  The option can be found under the Charge Master Menu
 [IBCR CHARGE MASTER MENU], is called Extract Charge Master RC Rates [IBCR
 RC EXTRACT] and is locked with the IB SUPERVISOR security key.  This
 option is used to extract rates in a format that can be imported to
 Excel.  The extract will allow you to create a text file that is
 delimitated by the circumflex/caret (^) character. When importing to Excel
 specify that delimiter.  This can be used for any version of RC from 2.0
 or above.  The output device selected should be a Host File Server (HFS)
 or the Current Terminal (for screen capture).
  
  
 The remaining changes below will not be active until the site's PFSS 
 On/Off Switch is changed to an "ON" status.
  
 Currently the IB software keeps track of a veteran's Outpatient 
 Medication Copayment cap status across all VA facilities in an automated 
 process.  This process is being enhanced to allow for a site to become a 
 PFSS active site.  The IB software will be utilized as a "broker" of the 
 data between the PFSS COTS billing replacement system and other VA sites 
 of record for patients.  The IB software will no longer do the 
 calculation of copayment cap information once a site is active for PFSS, 
 but it will store the data and share it between the COTS system and sites 
 not active for PFSS.  All the processing will continue to take place in 
 the background with minimal user intervention.
  
 IB will receive Outpatient Medication Copayment charge information from 
 the COTS system and continue to store the data in the IB COPAY 
 TRANSACTIONS (#354.71) file.  To support remote queries for Means Test 
 charge data and Long Term Care charge data, IB will also receive updates 
 from the COTS system and store the data in the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION 
 (#350) file, MEANS TEST BILLING CLOCK (#351) file, and LTC COPAY CLOCK 
 (#351.81) file.  The computation for the charge data will be transferred 
 to the COTS billing replacement system and will be sent via HL7 messages 
 to the local VistA system.
  
  
 Technical Description
 =====================
 IBARX is being modified to trigger remote queries on new patients at time 
 of finish.  During the finish process the pharmacy package makes a call 
 to XTYPE^IBARX to determine a patient's copayment status.  At that time 
 IB will queue off a tasked job to accomplish the query in the background 
 before the pharmacy releases the medication to the patient.
  
 IBARXMI is the processing receiver routine for all HL7 inbound messages to
 the IB package from the COTS billing replacement package.  The routine 
 will verify data received, transform as necessary and file.  If the data 
 received is not correct, the variable HLERR will be set with a message to 
 indicate the error.
  
 IBARXMN is the current processing routine for processing entries in the 
 IB COPAY TRANSACTIONS (#354.71) file.  This routine is being updated to 
 also call the VistA Data Extraction Framework (VDEF) package to also 
 share the copayment information with the COTS billing replacement system.
  
 IBARXMR is being updated to call VDEF if a back billing message is 
 received from a remote VA site that needs to be back billed on the COTS 
 billing replacement system.
  
 IBARXPFS is a new routine being used as the main entry point for HL7 
 parsing and distribution and the initial remote query for patients that 
 are receiving their first Outpatient Medication Copayment at the local 
 facility.
  
 IBCROE is a new routine that is utilized for the new RC extract option,
 the format is such that can be imported to Excel.
