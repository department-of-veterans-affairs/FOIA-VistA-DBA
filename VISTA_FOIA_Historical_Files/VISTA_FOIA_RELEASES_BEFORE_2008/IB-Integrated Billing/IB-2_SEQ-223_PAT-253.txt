 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 1. ISP-1103-N0547     MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE AND PENSION RATES - CY 2004
    
 Problem:
 --------
 Every year the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible and
 for the pension threshold rates.  These values need to be updated in the
 associated billing files.  For several years, the sites have been sent an
 informational patch to remind them to update the values manually.
 This can result in delays and mistyped entries.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, for the 2004 rates, will once again automate the update of the
 Medicare and pension threshold values.  A post-init routine is included in
 this patch which will install the new values.  The Technical section below
 contains a list of the new rates which may also be found in VHA Directive 
 2003-069.  If a site has already entered the values manually, the record
 will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year (CY) 2004 (with an effective date
 of 12/1/03) are defined in VHA Directive 2003-069, dated December 15, 2003 
 as:
   
 *   $ 9,894 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 12,959 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 1,688 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
  
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2004 is shown as:
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 876.
   
 ********Please Note********
 
 Since the effective date of the Medicare Deductible was 1/1/2004 and 
 this patch was not completed prior to that date, Means Test Billing 
 Clocks that started this year prior to the installation of this patch 
 may have last years deductible amount.

      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
