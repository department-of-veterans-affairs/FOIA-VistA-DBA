Subject: AD HOC & CONTACT NUMBER PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  
 Patch fixes two NOIS related problems.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
 GNH-1098-40506, NTH-1098-71117
  
 This patch addresses the following E3R:
 E3R #11614
  
  
 The Patient Representative package was set up to allow 9999 Reports of
 Contact per site per year.  That is not adequate, especially now that some
 sites have integrated.  A change has been made in the Data Dictionary
 input transform for the Contact Number (file #745.1, CONSUMER CONTACT,
 filed #.01, Contact Number). The field has been expanded to allow
 for higher Contact Numbers.  The "C" cross-reference on the field has been
 altered to allow look-up on the sequence portion of the Contact Number.
 Reported in NOIS NTH-1098-71117.
  
 The Ad Hoc Report using the following sort criteria did not produce the
 desired output.
 Sort selection #1 : '2,@10,+25,+23
 Reported in NOIS GNH-1098-40506 and E3R #11614
 In addition, this patch adds the Issue Code Name as menu selection.  In
 the past the expanded text of the Issue Code Name printed or displayed
 wherever the Issue Code printed or displayed.  Now the user can include
 the name if wanted, or leave it off the report.  If the Issue Code Name is
 wanted, but is being displayed starting in a column towards the middle or
 end of the line the print qualifier ";Ln" can be used to shorten it to n
 characters.
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible
 conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VistA users will not be
 affected.
  
     Patient Representative Manager Menu [QAC MAIN MENU]
     User Menu [QAC USER]
