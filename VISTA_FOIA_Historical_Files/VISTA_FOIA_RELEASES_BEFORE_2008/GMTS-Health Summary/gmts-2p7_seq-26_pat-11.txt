Subject: SURGERY COMPONENT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 
   This patch updates the SURGERY REPORTS component to include the
   PRINCIPAL ANESTHESIOLOGIST in the report.  This component also
   returns both operating room and non operating room procedures.
   The default header name for the SURGERY REPORTS component is changed
   from "Surgery Reports" to "Surgery Rpt (OR/NON)" to reflect the
   contents of the component.
  
   This patch also adds three new surgery related components.  They are:
  
   SURGERY NON OR PROCEDURES               NSR
 
     This component will return only non operating room procedures.  The
     component will include provider specialty, provider, procedure status,
     attending, principal diagnosis, procedures performed, principal
     anesthesiologist, operative findings, and indication for procedure.
  
   SURGERY ONLY REPORTS                    SRO
 
     This component will return only operating room procedures.  The component
     will include surgery date, surgeon, surgery report status, pre-operative
     diagnosis, post-operative diagnosis, surgeon's dictation, current
     procedural terminology (CPT) operation code and text, and principal
     anesthesiologist.
  
   SURGERY SEL NON OR PROCEDURES           SNSR
 
     This component will allow the user to select one or more CPT codes and
     then will report back only those NON OR procedures that match.  The CPT
     code is checked against the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE (#27) of the
     SURGERY (#130) file.

 INSTALLATION:
 =============
 
   This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation
   will take less than two minutes.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
       load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
   
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
       removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
       select the Installation menu.
     
   4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
       options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMTS*2.7*11):
    
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       b.  Print Transport Global
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
       d.  Backup a Transport Global
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       GMTS*2.7*11.
    
   6.  When prompted "Include DISABLED components in the AD HOC
       HEALTH SUMMARY? NO//", respond "NO"
 
   7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
       Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO"
   
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
       should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
       has run to completion.
  
   9.  The routine GMTS2711 may be deleted after successful installation
       of this patch.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - GMTSRON

 GMTSRON is a new routine and handles both the SURGERY NON OR PROCEDURES 
 and the SURGERY SEL NON OR PROCEDURES components.  The NON OR information
 was removed from the GMTSRO routine and modified to include the data 
 requested in NOIS HIN-1096-42235.  A separate NON OR procedures component
 was requested in E3R 7955.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSRO

 Routine GMTSRO was modified to include the principal anesthesiologist on the
 SURGERY REPORTS component (input from test sites).  It was also noted that the
 failure to kill ^UTILITY($J,"W") before exiting this routine could potentially
 cause an infinite loop in other routines that used this same global reference. 
 It is now killed after each use (see NOIS: TAM-0997-32272).  Finally, a blank
 line was inserted between procedures for readability.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSROB

 Routine GMTSROB has been modified to look at the corresponding NON OR fields
 to determine the correct status of the procedure (during initial testing the
 status returned for non operating room procedures was always "unknown").

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTS2711

 GMTS2711 is the post-init for this patch.  It will add the new components, 
 change the description of the SURGERY REPORTS component, and add the new 
 components to the VAQ - DATA SEGMENT (#394.71) file so they can be used in
 PDX (Patient Data Exchange).
