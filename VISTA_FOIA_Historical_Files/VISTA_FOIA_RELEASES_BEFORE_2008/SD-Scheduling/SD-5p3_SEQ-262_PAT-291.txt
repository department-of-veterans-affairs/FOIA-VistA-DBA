Subject: MODIFICATIONS TO VISTA CAAR REPORT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 CAAR - Clinic Appointment Availability Report can be printed from ACRP REPORTS
 Menu. This patch was developed in response to the following IT Service 
 Requests:
 
 20030303 - Modification to CAAR Report
 20020302 - Modification to VistA CAAR option.
 
 The following functionality has been added:
 
 1. A new report may be generated for selected patients from a list of 
 patients entered by names or SSN. That option was added to the 
 existing process of generating reports. A user may skip entering a patient 
 to proceed to an existing functionality or if at least one patient is 
 entered an option to generate a new report is available. Appointments 
 are printed for the selected range of days, separately for each 
 clinic with data allowing for the evaluation history. The following additional
 data, not used in existing reports, is included in the report:
 
 - REBOOK DATE
 - APPOINTMENT STATUS
 - COMPLETION DATE
 - SCHEDULER
 
 2. The Summary option was modified to allow the user to specify which Stop 
 Code Pair to include. This modification permits print selection to be 
 limited to the clinic with the selected stop code pair.

      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  4.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.

      menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System

 1. Execute option: CAAR  Clinic Appointment Availability Report from
    SCRPW ACRP REPORTS MENU. If selecting a Detailed report you should be
    prompted for patients names for printing a newly designed report,
    separately for each entered patient.
    A new prompt for 'CA CLINIC ALL' allows for including all clinics for the
    patients reports.
    Skipping an answer to the prompt for a patient name will
    direct you to the previously existing options 'CL CLINIC NAME' and
    'CP CLINIC PAIR' only.
