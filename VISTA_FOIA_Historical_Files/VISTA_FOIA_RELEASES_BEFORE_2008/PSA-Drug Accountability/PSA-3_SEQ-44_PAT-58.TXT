Subject: 12 DIGIT NDC, FORCED DRUG SELECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch addresses the following problems:
   
  1. HD 67762 - NYH-1003-12255  12-DIGIT NDC #
   
  The emerging standard is becoming 11 digits for the National Drug Code 
  (NDC). The code had previously been set to create/require 12 digits by 
  adding leading zeros. It is now set to create/require 11 digit NDCs. 
   
  2. HD 68340 - Forced acceptance of selected drug CLE-1004-40882
   
  The software is completing the selection of a unique drug name without 
  giving the user the chance to verify the selection. The drug name is 
  unique and the few characters input by the user is enough to select the 
  drug. Once the drug is selected it is not easy to navigate the software 
  to a place where the drug can be reselected if the selection completed by 
  the software is not what the user wanted.

  NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ==================== 
   
  1.HD67762           PSANDF  12 digit NDC
  PROBLEM
  ======= 
  The emerging standard is becoming 11 digits for the National Drug Code 
  (NDC). The code had previously been set to create/require 12 digits by 
  adding leading zeros. It is now set to create/require 11 digit NDCs.
  RESOLUTION
  ==========  
  User screens now are altered to present 11 digit NDC codes and user 
  prompts.
  TECHNICAL:
  ========== 
  Modify PSANDF and PSANDF1 to check for eleven digit NDC codes. If the
  user attempts to enter more then eleven digits the system will display
  the message "You must enter exactly eleven numbers."  If the user
  attempts to enter less then eleven digits the system will display the 
  message "Enter the 11-digit National Drug Code. Do not enter dashes."
  When the user enters ?? the help message 
      The NDC must be 11-digits. If the NDC does not contain
      11 numbers, zero fill the section of the NDC that is missing.
  
      The NDC contains three sections separated by dashes.
      It contains 5 digits, a dash, 4 digits, a dash, then 2 digits.
  
      For Example: If the NDC is 12345-123-1, enter 12345012301.
                   If the NDC is 12345-123-12, enter 12345012312.
   
  2. HD68340 Forced selection of unique drug names.
  PROBLEM:
  ======== 
  The software is completing the selection of a unique drug name without 
  giving the user the chance to verify the selection. The drug name is 
  unique and the few characters input by the user is enough to select the 
  drug. Once the drug is selected it is not easy to navigate the software 
  to a place where the drug can be reselected if the selection completed by 
  the software is not what the user wanted.
  RESOLUTION:
  ===========
  The request for selection of a drug is now followed by a prompt showing 
  the drug selected and a 'Yes/No' question 'Is this correct'. If the user 
  answers no then it returns to the select drug prompt.
  TECHNICAL:
  ========== 
  Routine PSANDF has been modified to provide user verification of the drug 
  being selected.
