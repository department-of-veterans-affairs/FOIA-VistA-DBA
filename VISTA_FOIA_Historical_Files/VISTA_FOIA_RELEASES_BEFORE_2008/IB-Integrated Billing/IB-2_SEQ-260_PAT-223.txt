 PATCH OVERVIEW
 ---------------
  
 The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
 Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
 ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic 
 transmission of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers 
 and the receipt of claim responses (including drug utilization review 
 responses and warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and 
 introduced in a phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy 
 was utilized due to the complexity of the functionality and the number of 
 product line dependencies.
  
 The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1.0, comprised of
 the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
 namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
 PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation.The patches
 are combined in host file BPS_1_0.KID in order to simplify installation.
 BPS*1.0 is a dormant release that only allows each site to perform
 preliminary setup work and to confirm that the software does not adversely
 affect other packages.
  
 There are two main areas addressed by BPS*1.0:
  
 a. Registration of the Pharmacy with the Vitria BusinessWare IE.
 b. The Insurance Matching of Group Plans with Pharmacy Plans
  
 Following the installation of BPS*1.0, each site must register their 
 pharmacy with Vitria and match applicable insurance group plans using the 
 insurance matching screens. These processes are detailed in the HIPAA 
 NCPDP CONNECTION FOR EDI PHARMACY (Dormant Release) INSTALLATION GUIDE and
 the E-PHARMACY CLAIMS INSURANCE PROCESS document. Both of these documents
 are located on the anonymous directory. It is very important that the IRM
 or person installing the patch at each facility provide a copy of these
 documents to its ADPAC(s) and any other relevant staff who will be
 responsible for registering their pharmacy with Vitria and completing the
 insurance matching process.
  
 At a later date, additional HIPAA NCPDP patches will be released to 
 activate all of the HIPAA NCPDP functionality. Until that time, sites 
 will not be able to electronically submit claims utilizing this new 
 functionality.
  
 The HIPAA NCPDP project was created in response to a Chief Business 
 Office (CBO) request for modifications to several Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) software 
 applications in accordance with HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 
 transactions and NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically the NCPDP 
 Telecommunication Standard v.5.1.
  
 The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 This patch adds the necessary enhancements to the Integrated Billing 
 package to support NCPDP (National Council for Prescription Drug Programs)
 billing of pharmacy claims via the Outpatient Pharmacy package.
  
 The features are:
   
 1. When a patient is issued medication via Outpatient Pharmacy, 
 Outpatient Pharmacy will check with Integrated Billing (IB) to determine 
 if the prescription is NCPDP billable to a third party payer. The patient
 must have active, reimbursable insurance that covers prescriptions as
 specified in the patient's group policy coverage limitations.  The 
 prescription must not be for OTC or research medications and must not be 
 related to SC (Service Connected), AO (Agent Orange), IR (Ionizing
 Radiation), EC (Environmental Contaminants), HNC (Head/Neck Cancer), CV
 (Combat Veteran), or MST (Military Sexual Trauma).
  
 2.  A check will be done to see if the site's Claims Tracking module is 
 turned on for prescriptions.  When it is, the appropriate information 
 will be entered into that module in IB.  To ensure that the Autobiller 
 does not bill the prescription on a paper claim until the electronic 
 transmission can be processed, the EARLIEST AUTOBILL DATE will be set for 
 60 days into the future.  If the claim is not processed or resolved in 
 pharmacy within 60 days, then a paper claim will be automatically 
 generated.
  
 3.  If the bill for the prescription is approved by the third party 
 insurance carrier for payment, Outpatient Pharmacy will make a second 
 call to IB.  At that time, IB will create a bill in the BILL/CLAIMS 
 (#399) file for the amount of the total charge.  The bill will be 
 automatically authorized and passed to Accounts Receivable (AR).  IB will 
 have AR automatically audit the receivable and post a decrease adjustment 
 so that the amount of the outstanding receivable will be equal to the 
 amount of payment expected from the payer.
  
 4.  If a prescription bill is rejected, Outpatient Pharmacy will make a 
 second call to IB.  Assuming Claims Tracking is active for prescriptions, 
 IB will check to make sure the prescription is in Claims Tracking.  The 
 Claims Tracking entry will be picked up by the Autobiller to ensure 
 proper follow-up is done.
  
 5.  If a prescription bill is reversed in Outpatient Pharmacy, both the 
 bill and receivable will be cancelled.
  
 6.  To support claims other than Reimbursable Insurance for Veterans, IB 
 will ask for both the Administrative Fee and Dispensing Fee when a rate 
 schedule adjustment is entered.  These are optional and will be sent in 
 the NCPDP transmission.
  
 7.  To assist with the posting of payments, the API used to look 
 up bills to post payments in the Accounts Receivable package has 
 been updated to allow for input of the ECME number.
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 IB20P223 is an environment check to ensure that the site has 4 national 
 rate types defined.  If the rate types are not defined, a site will need 
 to defined them prior to install.  The 4 rate types are:
          CHAMPUS (or TRICARE)
          CHAMPUS REIMB. INS. (or TRICARE REIMB. INS.)
          CHAMPVA
          CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.
 If your site does not have the exact spelling as shown above, you should 
 contact EVS for assistance.  Your site may have them defined but the 
 names may have been changed.
  
 This routine also has a post install that will add two reasons not 
 billable.  They are:
          HEAD/NECK CANCER
          COMBAT VETERAN
  
 IBCRCC has an optional parameter in the RATECHG line tag of FEE.  If this 
 parameter is passed by reference, the API will return any Administrative 
 Fee and Dispensing Fee amounts for the Rate Schedule.
  
 IBCREE has been modified to capture the Administrative Fee and Dispensing 
 Fee, if appropriate.  The Rate Schedule adjustment must have an amount 
 added in the calculation of the adjustment for the fee questions to be 
 asked.
  
 IBCRU3 has been modified to add a new entry point to look up the event 
 pointer based on a rate type.
  
 IBJTCA1 is included to add enhancements to the Third Party Joint Inquiry 
 to display new information that relates to ECME claims.
  
 IBNCPDP is the main API routine to be used by Outpatient Pharmacy.  All 
 new APIs will be supported with this routine.
  
 IBNCPDP1 will handle the initial call by Outpatient Pharmacy.  This 
 routine will load the prescription information to Claims Tracking, look 
 up insurance information, verify active pharmacy coverage and return the 
 necessary billing information so that a NCPDP claim can be produced.
  
 IBNCPDP2 will handle all response information sent from Outpatient 
 Pharmacy.  This routine will create bills, authorize bills, audit bills, 
 adjust bills, cancel bills and ensure that the claims are updated in 
 Claims Tracking.
  
 IBNCPDP3 will handle Average Wholesale Pricing updates.
  
 IBNCPCPU will be a utility routine for all the NCPDP billing needs in IB.
  
 IBRFN has been updated to allow for input of an ECME number when posting 
 payments in the Accounts Receivable package.  The API for AR will now 
 return the type of lookup found.
  
 IBRUTL is being included to suppress the third party billing bulletin when
 a first party bill goes on hold for third party billing and the bill has
 already been billed using the ECME software.
  
 IBTUTL1 has been modified to accept an additional optional parameter in 
 the REFILL line tag for the EARLIEST AUTOBILL DATE.  If the new parameter 
 is specified in the call, that date will be used instead of the existing 
 functionality.
