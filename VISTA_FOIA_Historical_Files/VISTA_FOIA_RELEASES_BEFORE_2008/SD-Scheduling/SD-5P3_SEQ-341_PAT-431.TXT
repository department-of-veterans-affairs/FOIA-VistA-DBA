Subject: PRACTITIONER'S PATIENTS REPORT NO MEANS TEST STATUS

Category:

Description:

 This patch will fix the Patient Care Management Module (PCMM) Practitioner's
 Patients List Report so that the Means Test Status Code properly prints on 
 the report.

 NOIS/REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ============================
 IRO-0103-41460 (HD63409) - PRACTITIONER'S PTS OPTION
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the Practitioner's Patient List Report, it no longer
    prints the Means Test Status Code.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Currently, routine SCRPEC makes a call to MNTEST^SCUTBK10, which
    in turn, makes an extrinsic call to $$LST^DGMTU to retrieve the
    patient's means test data.  New logic was added to routine
    SCUTBK10 with PCMM Phase I patch SD*5.3*264, so that now the
    means test data is returned as null to routine SCRPEC.  Routine
    SCRPEC will be changed to directly make the extrinsic call to
    $$LST^DGMTU to retrieve the means test data.
