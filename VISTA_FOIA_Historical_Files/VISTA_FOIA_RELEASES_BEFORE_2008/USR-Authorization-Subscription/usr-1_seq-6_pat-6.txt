Subject: REDUNDANT CLASS MEMBERSHIP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 In the past some users have been made members of a class more than once. It
 was not possible to see this because only a single instance of class
 membership was displayed. This patch changes the display so that all
 instances of class membership will be displayed. It also adds a screen to
 prevent a user from being added to a class if they are already a current
 member.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1. Routine:  USRLM
 Changed the way WHATIS builds the CLASS array so that it will contain all
 instances of class membership. It will now show that a user is a member of a
 class more than once. Changed ISA so it will search for multiple instances of
 class membership and return true if any of them are current.
  
 2. Routines:  USRLM,USRMEMBR,USRUMMBR
 Added the entry point ISAWM for ISA with message to USRLM. This just calls ISA
 to check for class membership. If the user is already a member it outputs a
 message saying so. Changed the DIC("S") screens in USRMEMBR and USRUMMBR to use
 ISAWM instead of just plain ISA.
