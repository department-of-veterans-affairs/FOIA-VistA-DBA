Version : 5.3       SEQ #448                     Status: Released

Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*489  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*516'

Subject: VADPT PREVENTING PRINTING OF MEANS TEST LETTERS 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 NOTE:  **  THIS IS AN EMERGENCY PATCH  **
    
 This patch addresses a NOIS in which a call to ADD^VADPT is
 returning a temporary address start date when there is not
 one.  This was discovered using an option in the Enrollment
 Application System, but due to the prevalent use of this call
 to obtain address information, is much more wide spread.
     
 Because the problem is exacerbated by the release of DG*5.3*506,
 EAS*1*29 and IVM*2*76, we are releasing this patch as an Emergency.
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ----------------
 1. ISA-0403-11105   VADPT RETURNING INDICATION OF TEMP ADDRESS 
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Salisbury, NC
 Bay Pines, FL
  
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1. ISA-0403-11105   VADPT RETURNING INDICATION OF TEMP ADDRESS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was reported that the address information being returned by
    the code at ADD^VADPT for a patient was incorrect in certain
    circumstances.  The returned array can sometimes indicate a
    temporary address start date is present, even though it is not.
    This can occur only in situations where a patient does not have
    a phone number in the PATIENT (#2) file.  In the case of using
    the Letters Print Menu [EAS MT PRINT MENU] options, some Means
    Test letters were not printed because of this faulty address
    information.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The patch fixes this problem, so patients without phone numbers
    and without temporary addresses will not return a temporary
    address start date.
