 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 1. SHE-0801-51284     Cat C reminder letters printing 
    
    Problem:
    --------
    With DG*5.3*326, Category C veterans and those Pending Adjudication and 
    having agreed to pay the deductible, and whose Means Test is more recent
    than 10/05/99, will no longer be subject to an annual MT. However, if the
    site has the Income Test Reminder Letters option turned on, these now
    exempt patients are included in the output. Since they are no longer
    subject to MT, their copay status will remain unchanged. As such, they
    should no longer be included in those patients due for a reminder.  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects the issue by checking the veteran's status and 
    removing them from the Means Test reminder list if they meet the
    criteria mentioned above.
    
 2. COA-0403-21056     <UNDEF> MAIN+2^IBTOSUM2 in MCCR/UR SUMMARY REPORT
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the IBT OUTPUT MCCR/UR SUMMARY option for a date range that
    contains no Claims Tracking entry that is ACTIVE, INSURED and BILLABLE,
    an undefined error would occur. The printing function expected to find
    a value in the counter IBCNT(3,0) but if no records were selected 
    during the search, the counter was never set.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The counter array variable IBCNT(3,0) is initialized to zero prior
    to the record search.
    
 3. SBY-0403-30897     Claims Waiting Austin Acknowledgement
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When acknowledgment messages or status update messages are received
    from Austin, they are delivered to the S.IBCE MESSAGES SERVER
    option.  Because there is no specific SERVER MAIL GROUP defined for 
    this option, and the SUPRESS BULLETIN field is NULL (the default is
    to send), a message is sent to the default MAIL GROUP defined in the
    XQSERVER Bulletin (file 3.6). This is GENERALLY a mail group called 
    XQSERVER but it may have some other name.  If this MAIL GROUP 
    specified in the XQSERVER Bulletin suddenly has NO active members (for 
    whatever reason), the incoming messages will be RECEIVED, but the IBCE 
    MESSAGES SERVER is not served. The server option is listed as a
    recipient but server action was not processed due to a security
    violation.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The issue could be resolved on a local basis by making sure that there
    is always a member of whichever mail group is specified by the XQSERVER
    bulletin. However, to avoid the problem altogether, this patch will
    set the SUPRESS BULLETIN field of the IBCE MESSAGES SERVER option
    to YES. The bulletin only announces that there has been server
    activity. It is not necessary for actual distribution of the incoming
    reports so suppressing the bulletin will have no detrimental effect.
    
 4. BRX-0403-12417     BULL1+4^IBTUBUL:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the option IBT SEND TEST UNBILLED MESS, a software error
    is logged because the TESTV subroutine fails to initialize the 
    IBUNB("EPISM-A") variable. This problem only occurs for the TEST
    messages and not for the real messages.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The missing variable is initialized so that the TEST message
    function can be utilized.
    
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
    
 1.  SHE-0801-51284     Cat C reminder letters printing
     Changes are made to routines: IBARXEL, IBARXEL1
     The function $$BIL^DGMTUB(X,Y) is called and the veteran is
     either sent a letter or not sent a letter based on the result.
    
 2.  COA-0403-21056     <UNDEF> MAIN+2^IBTOSUM2 in MCCR/UR SUMMARY REPORT
     The initialization of the IBCNT array is modified in the RPT section
     of routine IBTOSUM.  The code S IBCNT(3,0)=0 is added.
    
 3.  SBY-0403-30897     Claims Waiting Austin Acknowledgement
     The SUPRESS BULLETIN field (#224) of the OPTION file (#19) for
     option IBCE MESSAGES SERVER is set to the value Y.
    
 4.  BRX-0403-12417     BULL1+4^IBTUBUL:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable
     The TESTV subroutine of IBTUBUL is modified to contain the line:
     S IBUNB("EPISM-A")=11111.
