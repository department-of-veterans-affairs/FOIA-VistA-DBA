============

 Patch XM*7.1*97
  
 NOIS:  none
 Test Site:  GATEWAY.FORUM.VA.GOV
  
 There's a strange problem with local mail delivery which sometimes occurs.
 It manifests itself in an undefined ^XMB(3.9,XMZ,3,0) in RDELIVER^XMTDL.
 This patch adds a variable which should aid in debugging.
  
 If you see an error trap involving RDELIVER^XMTDL, please log a NOIS.
 Include in the NOIS a copy of the error trap and a copy of the messages
 in the MESSAGE file involved in the error.  You'll find them in XMZ and
 in XMZRLIST.  Thanks.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.
