 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) ISP-0704-N1524     NEW LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet
  
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Audrey Tomlinson has requested an update to the current AMIE  
    worksheet for NEW LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    a) Created post-install routine DVBA74PI that will deactivate the
       current LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet
      (file #396.6 ien of 170), and activate the new 
      LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet (file #396.6
      ien of 188).
    b) Created routine DVBCWLL that contains the text of the new 
       LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet.
    c) Created routine DVBCWLL1 to access the text routines in b),
       and print the new LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS worksheet.
