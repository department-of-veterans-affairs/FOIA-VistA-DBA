Subject: CAPRI TEMPLATE UPDATE

Category:

  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 The goal of the Compensation and Record Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation 
 and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) project is to implement the current
 Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) compensation and pension
 exam worksheets in an electronic format that will upload exam results into
 Text Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
 CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*91.  This CAPRI GUI
 version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
 the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
 exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
 Please refer to the user guide for further information on CAPRI CPWM.
  
 No new functionality is being provided with this patch.  This patch will 
 fix the following defects:
  
 Initial PTSD - Should not have contained the CAPS 17 button on the 
 history tab since it was incomplete it has been removed.
  
 Initial PTSD - On the psych summary tab, at the end where other comments 
 go, the Other Comments does NOT print on the preview or the final 
 report.  This will now print on the preview and the report.
  
 Initial PTSD - Under the DIAGNOSIS tab, axial information, AXIS 1 - 
 Multiple diagnosis text box does not print out in the report. This will 
 now print on the preview and the report.
  
 Initial PTSD - The pre-military history tab would not allow the examiner 
 to "describe legal or other consequence" with alcohol/other substance use.
  
  
 Initial PTSD - History Tab_Current Treatment window_caption looks enabled 
 but box is disabled for entry.  Caption has been disabled until "other" 
 is chosen.
  
  
 Mental Disorders - The pre-military history tab would not allow the 
 examiner to "describe legal or other consequence" with alcohol/other 
 substance use.
  
  
 Mental Disorders - DX Tab under "Axis" section there is a question "Does 
 each diagnosis of a mental disorder meet the DSM-IV dagnostic criteria? 
 "Diagnostic" was not spelled correctly.
  
  
  
 Mental Disorders - On the psych summary tab, if a user enters data for 
 either of the following two questions:
   1. "Describe the linkage between mental disorder symptoms and 
       aforementioned changes in impairment, in functional state and
       quality of life"
   2. "Effect of Mental Disorder on Social and Occupational Functioning"
  
 The report text would improperly refer to PTSD instead of Mental 
 Disorders.  The report now refers to Mental Disorders.
