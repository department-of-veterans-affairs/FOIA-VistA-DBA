Subject: MENU SETUP FOR AMIE II

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 Informational patch
 
 All sites that have associated VBA Regional Offices should have already 
 followed the steps in this patch.  This was installed in 1998 with the 
 initial roll-out, and now needs to be tracked.  This patch is intended 
 for information only.  Sites that installed AMIE II early in the process 
 may find some minor changes in the menu structures listed below in the 
 "Menus:" section.
 
 Since Text Integration Utilities was activated and Discharge Summary was 
 inactivated at different times at different sites, all sites should verify 
 that the TIU option has been added to the menu [DVBA VARO REMOTE].  Sites 
 that have stopped using Discharge Summary may remove the option [GMRD BRIEF 
 MENU CLINICIAN].
 
 Any sites that have not already followed all of the steps in setting up 
 AMIE II, including creating the users in the standard format, is encouraged 
 to do so as soon as possible.  For specific instructions, the AMIE II 
 Installation Guide is available for download from 
 http://152.128.193.248/amieii/download.htm.
 
 The AMIE II project allows Regional Office (VBA) employees direct
 access to veterans' medical records in the Vista system.  In order to
 support this, 2 standard VistA menus and a Health Summary type should be
 created at each site.
 
 This informational patch lists the options included on these menus:
 
         [DVBA VARO REMOTE]      VA Regional Office Remote Menu
         [DVBA RADIOLOGY VARO]   Radiology Reports for VARO (a sub menu)
 
 and the components in this Health Summary Type:
         "Regional Office"
 
 Setting up a Regional Office User at a Medical Center:
 
 1) You should receive a signed standard security statement for each user to 
    be added.  File and maintain these statements as you do for other VistA 
    users at your site.
 
 2) Assign (create) the user access and verify code as specified in the AMIE 
    II Installation Guide.   This document is available for download from 
    http://152.128.193.248/amieii/download.htm
 
 3) Assign the user the primary menu [DVBA VARO REMOTE].
 
 4) Some sites may choose to add secondary menu items for their Regional 
    Office users.
 
 5) Assign the user the security key XM NO BROADCAST, and any local security 
    keys required at your site.  The standard AMIE II menu does not require any 
    security keys.
 
 6) Using the Edit an Existing User option, set the PREFERRED EDITOR: to be 
    SCREEN EDITOR (page 1 of Edit an Existing User screen)
 
 7) Set AUTO MENU: to be YES, MENUS GENERATED (page 2 of Edit an Existing 
    User screen)
 
 8) If your site uses a MESSAGE ACTION DEFAULT of DELETE//, please notify 
    the technical POC at the VARO so that the RO users can configure their 
    account to IGNORE//.  This is very important, because these users need 
    identical functionality at each site.

 Security key:
 NAME: XM NO BROADCASTS
  DESCRIPTION:   The holder of this key will not receive any broadcast 
  messages, whether locally-generated or from POSTMASTER@FORUM.
  This key is intended for users for whom broadcasts may not be applicable.   
 
 For example, some VISN users typically log in to multiple sites in their daily
  work and do not need to see broadcasts at each site.
