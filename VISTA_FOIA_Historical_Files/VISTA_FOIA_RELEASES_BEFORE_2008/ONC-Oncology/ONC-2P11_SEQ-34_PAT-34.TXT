Description: 
============

 This patch is available via FTP in a KIDS distribution file.  The Host
 File is named ONC211P34.KID and is located in the [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]
 directory of the following OI Field Offices.
     
  OIFO     FTP ADDRESS
  ----     -----------
  Albany   ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines    ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  SLC      ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
    
 All data dictionary changes/additions have been reviewed and approved by 
 the Data Base Administrator.
   
 The following NOIS calls have been resolved by this patch:
 
 NOIS MEM-0702-70741 (receiving warning)
 NOIS MEM-0802-71960 (EYE MELANOMA SIZE NOT ACCEPTED)
 NOIS MOU-0902-30332 (Undefined variable DR(2,160.042))
 
 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
 
  1) NOIS MEM-0702-70741 (receiving warning)
 
     Memphis reported a problem with the LATERALITY/TOPOGRAPHY interfield
     edit check.
  
     If the topography value is C41.4 (BONES, PELVIS, SACRUM, COCCYX)
     and the LATERALITY value is 0 (Not a paired site), the following
     interfield edit warning is generated:
 
     WARNING: BONES, PELVIS, SACRUM, COCCYX is a paired site
              LATERALITY must be provided for specified paired organs/sites
 
     This warning is confusing to the registrar.  SEER coding instructions
     specify that SACRUM should be coded with a LATERALITY value of 0 (Not a
     paired site) but the ONCOLOGY warning indicates that C41.4 is a paired 
     site.
 
    This discrepancy is due to the fact that C41.4 contains a mix of 
     "paired" and "unpaired" subsites but is, in general, considered a "paired" 
     topography.
       
     To avoid confusion we have enhanced the warning message as follows to
     include an additional note.
 
     WARNING: BONES, PELVIS, SACRUM, COCCYX is a paired site
              LATERALITY must be provided for specified paired organs/sites
           
              NOTE: If STERNUM, SACRUM, COCCYX or SYMPHYSIS PUBIS, override
              this warning.
 
  2) NOIS MEM-0802-71960 (EYE MELANOMA SIZE NOT ACCEPTED)
 
     TUMOR SIZE for melanoma cases is usually a measure of thickness in
     hundreths of a millimeter.  The exception to this rule is MALIGNANT
     MELANOMA OF UVEA AND OTHER EYE (C69.1-C99.4, C69.8-C69.9).  These
     cases measure TUMOR SIZE as the largest tumor dimensionn in whole
     millimeters.
   
     This patch will incorporate this exception into the TUMOR SIZE input
     and output logic.
 
  3) NOIS MOU-0902-30332 (Undefined variable DR(2,160.042))
     [ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...]
       [AI Complete Abstract]
 
     Patient History
 
     When editing the USUAL OCCUPATION multiple of the Patient History,
     if the registrar "up-arrow jumped" to a field within the multiple,
     the application would abort with "undefined variable DR(2,160.042)"
     error.
 
     This has been fixed.
     
  4) MIDDLE EAST SERVICE (160,55)
     SOMALIA SERVICE     (160,56)
 
     Two new fields, MIDDLE EAST SERVICE and SOMALIA SERVICE, have been 
     added to the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file.
 
     They have been placed in the VACCR v9.1 extract at the following
     locations:
 
     1384-1384 Somalia Service
     1386-1386 Middle East Service
 
  5) RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS
 
     RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS should not be coded for cases diagnosed as of
     1/1/96.  Consequently we have made the following changes:
 
     a) RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS will not be prompted for cases with a DATE 
        DX greater than 1995.
 
     b) The interfield edit check between DATE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION and
        RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS DATE has been made date sensitive.
 
     c) NO TREATMENT stuffing for RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS has been made 
        date sensitive.
 
     d) RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS will not appear on the [PA Print Complete
        Abstract] report if the DATE DX is greater than 1995.
 
     e) RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS and RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS DATE are no 
        longer required to "complete" the abstract.
 
  6) [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
       [EA Edit Site/AccSeq# Data]
 
     If DATE DX was 2001 or later, the [EA Edit Site/AccSeq# Data] option 
     was prompting for the wrong histology field.  It was prompting for 
     HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-2).  The correct histology field for a 2001 or later case
     is HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3).
 
     This has been fixed.
   
  7) CHI-SQUARE TEST
     [STA *..Statistical Reports ...]
       [CT Cross Tab Routines]
 
     The prompt "Do a Chi-square test? No// " was causing a problem if the
     crosstab report was queued.  For this reason, this prompt has been
     disabled.
     
  8) RX Date--Surgery [1200] 537-544
 
     There are 3 types surgery:
 
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE      (165.5,58.2)                               
  
     SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY  (165.5,138)
     SURGERY OF OTHER SITES/NODES (165.5,139) 
 
     NAACR has 1 date for all 3 surgeries: RX Date--Surgery [1200] 537-544
 
     Vista has separate dates for each surgery.
 
     When we extracted the data for "RX Date--Surgery" we only looked at 
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE DATE.  The correct extraction logic is to extract
     the earliest of the 3 surgery dates.  This has been fixed.
 
  9) SEER EOD, Third Edition
     NEW EXTENSION CODES FOR:
     BREAST
     PROSTATE GLAND - CLINICAL EXTENSION
     PROSTATE GLAND - PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION
 
     The following EXTENSION codes have been added:
 
     BREAST
       11 Entire tumor invasive (no in situ component)
       13 Invasive and in situ, invasive size coded
       14 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/in situ minimal
       15 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/in situ extensive
       16 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/proportions unknown
       17 Invasive and in situ, unknown size
       18 Unknown if invasive and in situ, unk if size mixed or "pure"
       21 Entire tumor invasive (no in situ component)
       23 Invasive and in situ, invasive size coded
       24 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/in situ minimal

       34 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/in situ minimal
       35 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/in situ extensive
       36 Invasive and in situ, entire size coded/proportions unknown
       37 Invasive and in situ, unknown size
       38 Unknown if invasive and in situ, unk if size mixed or "pure"
 
     PROSTATE
       33 Arising in prostatic apex
       34 Extending into prostatic apex
 
       The code 31 definition Prostatic apex) has also been modified as follows:
   
       31 Apex involvement, no detailed documentation
 
 10) CASEFINDING "Start Date" DEFAULTS
 
     The following casefinding options have been modified to provide
     default values for the "Start Date" prompts:
 
     [CF Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search]
     [RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search]
     [PT Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search]
 
     The "Start Date" default value will be the previous search's "Go to Date"
     value.
 
     NOTE: The first time this functionality is used, the default "Start
           Date" will be the current date.
