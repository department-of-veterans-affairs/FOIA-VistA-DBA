   OVERVIEW
   ========
  
   The purpose of the Geographic Means Testing Phase II project is to define
   the functionality required to implement automation to support the concept
   of a new category of veterans being termed User Enrollees.
  
   Veterans who do not utilize the VA health care system will not be required
   to submit financial information on an annual basis.  Assessment of
   financial status is only considered necessary for veterans who are
   actually utilizing their health care benefits, that is - receiving care
   through VA.  VHA will establish the concept of the "User Enrollee" to be
   utilized for enrollment communication purposes.
  
   This project addresses the identification of the User Enrollee and
   subsequent changes to reflect the business process of only sending MT
   renewals and GMT conversion communications to those veterans identified as
   User Enrollees.
  
   The Geographic Means Testing Phase II project will flag veterans who are
   actively using the system through appointments, Fee Basis authorizations,
   or Encounters as User Enrollees.  The user enrollee information will be
   shared with the Health Eligibility Center, who will share the same
   information with all sites of record.  Means Test renewal letters and GMT
   conversion letters will only be sent to veterans who are designated as user
   enrollees by the site that so designated the veteran.
  
   A one-time seeding of the user enrollee data by each site will be done.
   A Z07 HL7 message will be sent to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) for
   each veteran designated as a User Enrollee.  After the HEC receives the one-
   time seeding from all VISTA sites, the user enrollee data will be 
   synchronized with all sites of record by triggering a Z11 HL7 message for
   each veteran.
  
   The software for this patch, EAS*1*25, and associated patches,  are
   being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file
   DG_53_P497.KID). This patch contains the informational portion of
   EAS*1*25 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to
   acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
   The enhancements are being distributed in several patches that will be
   installed in three phases as outlined below:

   FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
   ======================
   The functionality that will be introduced with this patch is in a
   background process to determine User Enrollee status of the Veteran from
   inpatient/outpatient encounters, scheduled appointments and fee basis 
   authorizations. This background process is not visible to users.
  
  
   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
   =====================
  1)      Initial seeding of User Enrollees data will be performed via post
          install routine. Post install routine will perform initial
          determination of User Enrollee status for each veteran in the PATIENT
          file (#2). This routine will call Fee Basis, PCE, Scheduling and
          PIMS APIs to determine veteran's inpatient/outpatient encounters
          and future appointments. After determination of User Enrollee status,
          data will be sent to HEC via a Z07 HL7 message.
  2)      Means Test renewal letter process is modified to send letters only
          to veterans who are designated as user enrollees by the site that
          so designated the veteran.
  3)      After the initial seeding process is completed, whenever
          inpatient/outpatient encounters, new appointments or fee basis
          authorization changes occur, User Enrollee fields will be updated
          if necessary and shared with all sites of record via the HEC.
  
  
   PROTOCOL SUMMARY:
   =================

   encounters and scheduled appointments to determine User Enrollee status.
  
   1) EAS UE PCE EVENT - This Protocol is attached to multiple ITEM of 
                         PXK VISIT DATA EVENT Protocol.
