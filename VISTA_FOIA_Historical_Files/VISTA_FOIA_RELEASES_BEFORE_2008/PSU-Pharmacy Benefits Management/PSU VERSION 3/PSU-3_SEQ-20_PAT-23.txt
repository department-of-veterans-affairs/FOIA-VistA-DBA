Subject: ERROR ON PBM PRESCIPTION PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch contains modifications to the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
 package.
  
 1.  Problem:  When the monthly Prescription extract runs, an error occurs
 in the prescription patient demographics report if social security numbers
 are missing on patients included in the extract.
  
 Solution: Code has been altered to omit patients from the prescription patient
 demographics report if social security numbers are missing.  This prevents an
 error from occurring.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
    take less than 1 minute. There are no scheduling restrictions or
    recommendations.
  
    1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
         be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
         routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
         mapped set.
  
    3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
    4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSU*3.0*23)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSU*3.0*23.
  
    6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
       respond NO.
  
    7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
    8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
