Pain Medicine is a primary medical specialty based on a distinct body of 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,2,0)
knowledge and a well-defined scope of clinical practice that is founded 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,3,0)
on science, research and education. It is concerned with the study of 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,4,0)
pain, the prevention of pain, and the evaluation, treatment, and 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,5,0)
rehabilitation of persons in pain. A comprehensive evaluation 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,6,0)
incorporates the physical, psychological, cognitive and socio-cultural 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,7,0)
contributions to pain. The treatment protocol may include 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,8,0)
pharmacological, invasive, behavioral, cognitive, rehabilitative and 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,9,0)
complementary strategies provided in a concurrent focused and patient 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,10,0)
specific manner. The pain medicine physician often serves the patient as 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,11,0)
a frontline physician regarding their pain, but also may serve as a 
"DATA",8932.1,912,11,12,0)

advocate for the patient&apos;s pain care with public and private

including office, clinic, hospital, university, or governmental/public

Legal Medicine is a special field of medicine that focuses on various 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,2,0)
aspects of medicine and law. Historically, the practice of legal medicine 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,3,0)
made contributions to medicine as a scientific instrument to solve 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,4,0)
criminal perplexities. Since World War II, the domain of legal medicine 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,5,0)
has broadened to include not only aspects of medical science to solve 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,6,0)
legal and criminal problems but aspects of law as it applies to medicine.

of tort reform, and moral and ethical complexities presented by 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,10,0)
technological advances become increasingly prominent. Many medical 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,11,0)
schools have implemented courses which supply medicolegal instruction for 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,12,0)
medical students, and many law schools now offer medicolegal courses. 
"DATA",8932.1,914,11,13,0)
Also, dual degree programs in law and medicine have been created to
