Subject: FIX PCTS PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Informational

Description: 
============

This patch deals with the MailMan PCTS (Personal Computer Terminal System)
routine fixes, and PCTS documentation notes in the VA MailMan Technical
Manual and Systems Management Guide.
 
 
Correct documentation notes in the VA MailMan Technical Manual and Systems
Management guide:
 
In the VA MailMan Technical Manual and Systems Management guide, page 213,
the overview of the set-up is shown below:
 
       o Set up domain VHA.DMIA
       o Set up option for transmitting queue and schedule it to run
         periodically
       o Set up option for users to send a Twix
       o Start receiver (add to start up procedure)
 
 
The overview of the set-up is changed and shown below:
 
       o Set up domain VHA.DMIA
       o Make sure that domain VHA.DMIA contains correct local routing
         indicator in the domain transmission script
       o In routine XMRPCTS1, line 6, change XXXX to the local routing
         indicator for your site
       o In routine XMRPCTS1, line 7, change YYYY to your site name
       o Set up option for transmitting queue and schedule it to run
         periodically
       o Set up option for users to send a Twix
       o Start receiver (add to start up procedure)
 
In the VA MailMan Technical Manual and Systems Management guide, page 213,
the incorrect NETWORK ADDRESS is listed in the transmission script for
domain VHA.DMIA:
 
     NAME: VHA.DMIA        FLAGS: Q          PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE: MINIOUT
     TRANSMISSION SCRIPT: CONNECT
       TYPE: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
       PHYSICAL LINK / DEVICE: MINIOUT
       NETWORK ADDRESS (MAILMAN HOST): VHA.DM
       TEXT:
         O H=VHA.DMIA,P=SCP
         C MINI
         L ogin:
         S pcts
         L CODE:
         X W "PCTS RUCHxxx"
         X D ^XMRPCTS
 
 
 The correct transmission script for domain VHA.DMIA is shown below.
 Substitute your own PCTS routing indicator for 'RUCHxxx' in the TEXT
 of the script below.  For instance the routing indicator for the
 a site might be ROUTING1.  The line you would subsitute for
 X W "PCTS RUCHxxx",! would be X W "PCTS ROUTING1",!.
 
      NAME: VHA.DMIA       FLAGS: Q      PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE: MINIOUT
      TRANSMISSION SCRIPT: CONNECT
        TYPE: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
        PHYSICAL LINK / DEVICE: MINIOUT
        NETWORK ADDRESS (MAILMAN HOST): VHA.DMIA
        TEXT:
          O H=VHA.DMIA,P=SCP
          C MINI
          L ogin:
          S pcts
          L CODE:
          X W "PCTS RUCHxxx",!
          X S XMRPCTS0=XMCI+1
          X D ^XMRPCTS
          X K XMRPCTS0
 
 
 
Routine fixes:
 
    o See following Routine descriptions
    o This patch fixes problems associated with NOIS ID# TUA-0994-30187.
    o The installation is the same regardless of platform.
    o Users may be on the system during the installation of the patch.
 
XMA2, XMRPCTS, XMRPCTS0, XMRPCTS1, XMSM and XMR0B Routines -
    XMA2, XMRPCTS, XMRPCTS0, XMRPCTS1, XMSM and XMR0B routines were
    changed to ensure that a PCTS message that is put into a mail message
    can be sent and transmitted properly.
 
 
 
Installation Instructions
=========================
 
NOTE :  Save a copy of above routines either before you begin this
        installation or when requested to do so during the unloading
        of the specified PackMan message.  There are no difference
        in the installation on a VAX, an ALPHA or on a MSM platform.
 
1.  Check mapped routine set and unmap the appropriate MailMan routines.
 
2.  Load the PackMan message into your production account.
 
3.  Execute CHECK^XTSUMBLD to compute checksums for the following
    routines.
 
          XMA2      value = 10164265
          XMR0B     value = 9731680
          XMRPCTS   value = 5315978
          XMRPCTS0  value = 5817120
          XMRPCTS1  value = 6929051
          XMRPCTSA  value = 4903763
          XMSM      value = 10415783
 
    * Stop installation, reload the original routines and call your
      supporting ISC if these values do not match.
 
4.  If domain name VHA.DMIA is already defined in your domain file, make
    sure that domain name VHA.DMIA contains correct domain information as
    shown above.  If domain name VHA.DMIA is not defined in your domain
    file, use VA FileMan to add this new domain to your Domain File:
 
 >D P^DI
 
 VA FileMan XX.X
