Subject: DUPLICATE ORDER CHECK MODIFICATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 As part of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the BCMA 
 Special Focus Group Initial Request Analysis (IMR) project, some 
 changes were requested to the way duplicate orders are handled in 
 Inpatient Medications V 5.0.
  
 Current functionality concerning the duplicate order checks displays all
 duplicate drug and duplicate drug class orders found, but does not allow
 the user to select these for discontinuation. If the user wishes to
 discontinue any of the presented duplicates, they must wait until after
 they are done with the current order process in which the duplicate order
 checks presented their results. The major functionality change to the
 Inpatient Medications software will consist of allowing users to select
 for discontinuation any duplicate Inpatient orders found, at the time
 these duplicates are presented by the duplicate order checks.  In
 addition, all duplicate Outpatient orders found, are grouped together and
 displayed prior to all other order check results and will be used for
 information purposes only. The current process will be modified so that
 when a duplicate order check is performed, the duplicate Inpatient orders
 are displayed in a numbered list. The user will then be prompted to select
 which, if any, of the listed duplicate orders should be discontinued. The
 user may choose to select none, thus leaving all orders intact. The 
 results from both duplicate order checks, Duplicate Drug and Duplicate
 Drug Class, will be presented together. Duplicate order checks occur at
 several points in the ordering process, including, when entering a new
 medication order, when renewing an existing medication order, when
 finishing an order, and when editing an order's drug.
