Associated patches: (v)XU*8*136    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*192'

Subject: Correction to REQ ZTLOAD3

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 NOIS: ISB-0201-31135
 In the code for REQ^%ZTLOAD the new schedule time is put in the wrong
 piece of the TASK. The code which puts the time in the task record was
 not found at REQ^%ZTLOAD. The code at REQ^%ZTLOAD transfers control to
 %ZTLOAD3 which then contains the code being fixed. The 5th piece of
 ^%ZTSK(ztsk,0) was set when piece 6 should have been set.  
 Also the original create $H is moved to a new field (#16) and the $H
 at the time of requeueing is set into the 5th piece. 
 This patch fixes this problem.

 ========================================================================= 
 Installation:
  
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does not need to be stopped.
  
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
      
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
       
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
      
   4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
       This patch cannot be queued.
     **There is a slight chance that a job (User or TaskMan) could access
       this routine and get some CLOBER/NOSOURCE errors.
       If this isn't acceptable then see that all jobs on the system are
       stopped before installing this patch.
    
   5.  In Programmer mode:
       Use "D ^XPDKRN" then
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*192'
                               ==========
                               
         Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO 
         
         No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                         ==
       
   6.  After installing this patch,
       Cache Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
       DSM/MSM sites - you need to move the following routine from 
       your production account to each manager account:
       
       ZTLOAD3
       
   7.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
       All sites:
       DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
       Select the System
       Patch number to load: 192
                             ===
        
  8.   DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
