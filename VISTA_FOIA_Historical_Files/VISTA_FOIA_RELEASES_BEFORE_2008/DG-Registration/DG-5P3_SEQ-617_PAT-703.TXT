Description:
============

 Add Combat Veteran Eligibility Status to Patient Inquiry
 ========================================================
 Lynne Harbin, Assistant Director, Project Management Division, Health 
 Eligibility Center, is requesting to have Combat Veteran eligibility 
 status display on the Patient Inquiry screen in CPRS. The Combat Veteran
 is VA's primary concern. Placing CV eligibility on the patient inquiry
 screen will facilitate user's awareness of the CV eligibility status.
 Since CPRS GUI Patient Inquiry brings in the data from the DG Patient
 Inquiry option, adding the field to the DG Patient inquiry will also
 improve clinician's awareness of the veteran's combat status.
  
 Example:
  
   Combat Vet Status: ELIGIBLE                End Date: 12/13/2006
  
  
 Add Unemployable Indicator to Patient Inquiry
 ============================================= 
 A new field "Unemployable" indicator has been added to the DG Patient 
 Inquiry. Providers will immediately be able to determine a veterans
 eligibility for certain services.
  
 Example:
  
 Primary Eligibility: NSC (VERIFIED)
 Other Eligibilities: 
  
       Unemployable: NO
 Means Test Signed?: 
  
  
 Add Patient's Cell Phone Number and Email address to Patient Inquiry
 ==================================================================== 
 The patient's cell phone number has been added to the patient inquiry. If 
 there is a phone number in PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] field (#.134) Patient 
 file (#2) the information is now displayed. In addition if there is an 
 email address in EMAIL ADDRESS field (#.133) of Patient file (#2) the 
 information is displayed.
  
 Example:
  
  Address: 12 MIMI LN                    Temporary: NO TEMPORARY ADDRESS
           TROY,VA 22222
