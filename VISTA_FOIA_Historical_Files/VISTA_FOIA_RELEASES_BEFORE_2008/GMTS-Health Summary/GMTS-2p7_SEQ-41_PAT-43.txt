Subject: HFS/Window Print Fix

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   
   This patch fixes a problem when printing to a Windows printer.  Health
   Summary was printing all lines of text (1-999999999) on the first page
   (no page breaks).  This patch enables Health Summary to distinguish 
   between a host file intended for a printer (include page breaks) and a
   host file intended for a window with a scroll bar (no page breaks).  
  
   NOTE:  This patch was developed in conjunction with OR*3.0*85 but does 
          not require OR*3.0*85 for installation.
