Description:
============

 This patch ECX*3.0*51 addresses the following issues with the LAR extract.
 
 1. A Change Request was approved to modify the DSS LAR Translation Audit 
    Report such that it will ignore results beginning with a ">", "<", "GT" 
    or "LT" and not display on the report.  Routine ECXALAR2 was changed to 
    satisfy this request.
 
 2. A Change Request was approved to add 'Feces' as an additional specimen so 
    it can be linked when processing LAR data for DSS.
      a) A new multiple FECES SPECIMEN field (#4) was added to DSS LAB
         TESTS file (#727.2).
      b) Routine LRCAPDAR was modified in patch LR*5.2*307 to link LAR and 
         DSS data.
      c) The routine ECXLABRS associated with the 'Link DSS Selected Lab 
         Tests to Local Lab Tests' option was modified.
      d) The routine ECXLARP associated with the 'Print DSS Lab Test 
         Datasheet' option was modified.
      e) The help text for the options ECXLABRS and ECXLARP were updated to 
         include FECES in the description.
      f) F=Feces was added as part of the set of codes to file #727.2.
 
 3. The DSS LAB TEST named OCCULT BLOOD (FECAL) was changed to have a SOURCE 
    of 'Feces' instead of 'Blood'.
  
 4. Sites have found that when the 'DSS LAR Translation Audit Report' and 
    'LAR Extract' are ran together a undefined error is generated.  
    Researching the reports showed that they both call the routine LRCAPDAR 
    and both reports kill the global ^LAR(64.036).  Routine ECXALAR was 
    modified to set the LAR extract flag to a status of running when the 
    'DSS LAR Translation Audit Report' is selected to run.  Now, when one
     of the report is being ran and the other is initiated, the system will 
     give a message stating that the extract is already schedule to run.
 
 5.  The following entries will be added to the DSS LAB TESTS file (#727.2) 
     for FY2004.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*51):
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global. 
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*51.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options you
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
     ECX UNTRANS LAR REPORT  Lab Results Extract Untranslatable Results 
                             Report
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 9.  You may delete the routines ECX351PT from your production system after 
     the patch has been successfully installed.
