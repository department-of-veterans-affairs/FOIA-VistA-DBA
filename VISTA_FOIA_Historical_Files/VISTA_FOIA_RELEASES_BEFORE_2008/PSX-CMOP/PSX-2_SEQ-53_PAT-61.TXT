Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains an Application Program Interface (API) that will be 
 used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
 writes to the CMOP SYSTEM file (#550). Since this file is being replaced 
 as part of the Pharmacy Re-engineering project, any direct M-based global 
 reads or writes to this file must be replaced by calling the APIs provided 
 in this patch. When the new data source is in place the calling 
 applications will not be required to make any changes. These APIs 
 will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested data from the new data 
 source, when the time comes.
  
 This API replaces the following integration agreements:

   Documentation Retrieval:
   ========================
   
    Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:

       download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
       first available FTP server.
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
       specific server as follows:
   
       Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
    The documentation distribution includes:
