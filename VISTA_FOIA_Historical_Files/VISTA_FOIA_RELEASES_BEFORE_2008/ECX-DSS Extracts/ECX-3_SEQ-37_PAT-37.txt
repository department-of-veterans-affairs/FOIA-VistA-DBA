Subject: DSS Collateral Enhancements #1 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Description:
 ============
  
 ECX*3*37 contains five modifications to the DSS Extracts that are part of 
 the DSS Collateral Enhancements #1 as follows:
  
 1.  Removal of LMIP code set-up logic from the LAB Extract.  The extract will 
 terminate if LMIP codes are not being used (LMIP flag not set in file 
 #728).  At this time all sites have implemented the use of LMIP codes. 
 eliminating the need to check for non-LMIP codes.
  
 2.  Modification of the NOS Extract as follows:
  
        a.  Inclusion of no-shows that have been checked-in (data exists in the 
        check-in/check-out node ("S" node) of the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98) 
        of the PATIENT file (#2).
  
        Note: This adresses NOIS LIT-0601-70370.
  
        b.  Exclusion of appointments with a status of "No Action Taken" (STATUS 
            field (#3) in the APPOINTMENT multiple (2.98) of the PATIENT file 
            (#2) equal to "NT").
       
        Note:  This was an existing problem identified during the design 
               phase for item 2(a).
  
 3.  Modification of the following extracts to populate the Purple Heart 
 Indicator field (previously a place-holder):
  
          Extract Name (file #, field #)
          ------------------------------
          Admission Extract (727.802,56)
          Clinic Extract (727.827,61)
          QUASAR Extract (727.808,60)
          Event Capture Extract (727.815,60)
          Mental Health Extract (727.812,35)
          Prescription Extract (727.81,55)
          Prosthetics Extract (727.826,57)
          Surgery Extract (727.811,53)
  
 4.  Modification of the Lab Results Extract to use the Date Specimen 
 Collected (DAY field (#8) of the LAB RESULTS EXTRACT file (#727.824)) to 
 determine patient status (IN/OUT PATIENT INDICATOR field (#7)).  The DATE 
 RESULTS READY field (#15) was being used in previous versions.
  
 5.  Modification of the Prosthetics Extract (ECXPRO1) to correct the following:
  
        a.  The fractional portion of the COST OF TRANSACTION field (#24) of 
        the PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826) was being incorrectly 
        computed for amounts less than .50 and was creating a null value 
        for this field.  This has been corrected to compute the fraction 
        correctly.
  
        b.  The value for the COST OF TRANSACTION field (#24) of the 
        PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826) should be zero when the FORM
        REQUESTED ON field (#11) of the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR
        file (#660) is Stock or Inventory Issue.
  
        Note:  Both of these issues were reported in NOIS V13-1401-N2136.

     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
