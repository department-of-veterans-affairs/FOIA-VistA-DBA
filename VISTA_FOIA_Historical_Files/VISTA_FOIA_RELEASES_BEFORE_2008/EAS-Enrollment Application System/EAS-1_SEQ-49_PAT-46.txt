Description:
============

  
      **INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH IS TRANSPARENT TO USERS**
  
 Installing this patch (EAS*1.0*46) does not modify existing functionality
 or data in any way.
  
 PURPOSE OF THE PATCH
 ====================
  
 This patch is necessary due to the new Scheduling Replacement API that 
 will be used by VistA applications to integrate M-based Class I, Class 
 III and local applications with the Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) 
 Scheduling application being developed by the Scheduling Replacement 
 team.
  
 The Scheduling Replacement API will replace the other methods of
 accessing the patient appointment information stored in the following
 Scheduling files: APPOINTMENT (#2.98) sub-file of the PATIENT (#2) File
 and the APPOINTMENT (#44.001) sub-file of the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
 File.  During implementation of the new GOTS Scheduler, this appointment
 information will be moved to the GOTS database and deleted from the
 Scheduling files.
  
  
 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 The Scheduling Replacement API is designed to be 'flexible' and will
 switch from the old database source (VistA Scheduling files) to the new
 database source (GOTS SQL tables) without re-programming the requesting
 application.  All hard-coded and FileMan references to Scheduling globals
 in routines or data dictionaries have been replaced with the Scheduling
 Replacement API.
