 Interface Overview
 ------------------
 This document describes the design requirements for a software 
 development project where the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has 
 established a new set of revenue metrics for use in monitoring the 
 performance of the VHA revenue cycle at all VHA facilities.  The desired 
 metrics are industry-standard measures that are commonly used in other 
 public and private health care institutions.  VHA has an existing 
 centralized data warehouse that calculated these metrics and provides 
 results via a web-based performance metric site.  This data warehouse is 
 updated on a monthly basis.
  
 VHA's Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified the daily collection of 
 this data as a high priority to support the metrics development process.  
 CBO needs the daily collection of data to populate the centralized data 
 warehouse (database) with billing and collections transactions from each 
 VHA facility.  The calculated metrics would be viewable to field and 
 headquarters staff through an existing website.  An automated daily VISTA 
 extract would provide more timely and accurate data to this centralized 
 data warehouse (database).
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 For the national implementation of this project, data will be triggered 
 by normal user processing into a data queue file.  This data will be 
 formatted and placed in a flat file via a nightly process.  This nightly 
 process has been added to PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS - Accounts Receivable 
 Nightly Process Background Job. This nightly process will take any 
 pending batches, format them and ftp them directly to the Boston 
 Allocation Resource Center (ARC).  This ftp process is an automated 
 version of the existing manual FTP method employed by the MCCR Monthly 
 Extract.  If the FTP process fails, a mail message will be sent to the 
 select Mail Group.  If the ARC fails to acknowledge receipt and 
 processing of the data files via an automated mail message, the nightly 
 batch will automatically resend any data not successfully transmitted in 
 previous attempts.
  
 Configuration Requirements
 --------------------------
 This project will use the FTP transfer protocol to transmit data from the 
 VISTA system.  A standard defined directory will be utilized/created at 
 each facility where the data files will be temporarily placed for the FTP 
 process and will then be deleted immediately after the data is 
 transmitted.  Space requirements for the data file should not exceed 10 
 megabytes the maximum size for each batch.  There are no long term space 
 requirements due to the fact that the files are deleted after use.
  
 Installation Notes
 ------------------
 This patch only includes the trigger point for the Bill/Claims File #399 
 and the program that sets this trigger point.  The trigger point is a 
 MUMPS cross-reference added to the STATUS DATE field.
  
 ^DD(399,.14,0) = STATUS DATE^RD^^0;14^S %DT="E" D ^%DT S X=Y K:Y<1 X
 ^DD(399,.14,1,0) = ^.1
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,0) = 399^AF^MUMPS
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,1) = D BC^IBJVDEQ
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,2) = Q
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,"%D",0) = ^.101^2^2^3030826^^^
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,"%D",1,0) = This cross-reference sets the record into the 
 nightly Data
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,"%D",2,0) = Extract queue if it meets the criteria.
 ^DD(399,.14,1,1,"DT") = 3030826
 ^DD(399,.14,3) = Enter the date of last status change.
 ^DD(399,.14,5,1,0) = 399^.13^1
 ^DD(399,.14,21,0) = ^^1^1^2880831^
 ^DD(399,.14,21,1,0) = This is the date of the last status change.
 ^DD(399,.14,"DT") = 3030826
