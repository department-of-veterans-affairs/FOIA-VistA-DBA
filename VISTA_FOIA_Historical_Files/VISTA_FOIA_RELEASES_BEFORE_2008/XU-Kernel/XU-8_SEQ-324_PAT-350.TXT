Subject: KIDS MESSAGE FIX FOR REMEDY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch XU*8.0*350 addresses (fixes) the following issues with the KIDS in 
 support of Remedy Help Desk software.
  
 The requested functionality requires KIDS to provide a Patch Sequence 
 number and Revision/Version value to be added to the data message already 
 being sent to the Remedy server. The message is sent via Mailman so 
 Mailman will verify that the message has been sent successfully.  Remedy 
 will verify that all data being sent by KIDS including the Patch Sequence 
 number and Revision/Version value is good data.  This data will allow end 
 users to generate reports such as the Patch and Package Installation 
 Report.  When KIDS installs a patch, it sends a message with data to the 
 Remedy server. Two routines and two files have been modified to meet this 
 requirement.  In both files 9.6 (Build) and 9.7 (Install), two new field 
 have been added.
