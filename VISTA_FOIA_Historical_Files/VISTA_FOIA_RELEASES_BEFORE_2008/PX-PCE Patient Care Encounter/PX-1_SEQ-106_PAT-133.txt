Subject: ERROR WHEN PRINTING PCE ENCOUNTER SUMMARY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The PCE ENCOUNTER SUMMARY REPORT can error if the location of a visit is 
 null. This patch will make the Hospital Location "Unknown" instead of
 causing an error. This will be in keeping with the existing logic where
 the Hospital Location is set to "Unknown" if there is not a stop code for
 that location.

 ASSOCIATED NOIS(es):
 =====================
 PAL-0304-61925 - PXRRWLS2 error
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Eastern Colorado HCS
 El Paso,TX
 Palo Alto HCS
 Salisbury,NC
 Tomah,WI
 
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the clinic field in one of the encounters being reported is null the 
 report will crash with a "null subscript" error. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If the clinic field is null then make the Hospital Location "unknown". 
 This is the same logic already used elsewhere in this report. The 
 information from this encounter will then be on the report under the 
 "Unknown" hospital location line.
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 At PRV2+18^PXRRWLS2 set the variable CLINIEN to 0 if it is null. This 
 will cause the HLOCNAM variable to be set to "unknown".

 ======================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.
   
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PX*1.0*133)
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch.
          It will NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.)
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure 
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
            
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*133.
   
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES// respond "NO".
   
  7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES// respond "YES".
  
  8.  When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
      of order, enter the following:
  
         PCE ENCOUNTER SUMMARY
  
  9.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
