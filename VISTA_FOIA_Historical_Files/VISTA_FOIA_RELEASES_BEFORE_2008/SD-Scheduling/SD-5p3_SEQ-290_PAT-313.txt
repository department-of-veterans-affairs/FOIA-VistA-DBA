Subject: NATIONAL ROLLUP OF ADDITIONAL ENCOUNTER PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE:  Informational Patch XM*999*157 must be installed prior to 
        the installation of Scheduling's SD*5.3*313. Please refer 
        to the Mailman Patch description in FORUM for additional
        information.
  
 This patch introduces the National Rollup functionality for Additional
 Performance Measures (TIU) for national reporting. Two new options to
 Scheduling are introduced with this patch. The option, 'Schedule APM
 Performance Monitor Task' [SCRPW APM TASK JOB], will be scheduled to run
 on the 15th of each month as a background job through the OPTION
 SCHEDULING file. It will collect data on a monthly basis and the data
 collected at each site will be transmitted to a central location at 
 Austin Automation Center (AAC). A local mail group, 'SD PM NOTIFICATION 
 TIU' will receive notifications when the process completes. This mail
 group will also receive reject messages from the server in the event that 
 a problem is encountered with the transmission.  The option [SCRPW PM 
 RETRANSMIT REPORT] will allow users to retransmit reports in the event 
 problems are encountered. In addition this option will allow users to 
 retroactively transmit previous months data.
  
 This patch also introduces new functionality to the option 'PERFORMANCE
 MONITOR DETAILED REPORT' [SCRPW PM DETAILED REPORT] released in patch
 SD*5.3*292. When users select to run the report, they will have the option
 of selecting stop codes individually (i.e. 100,101,110) by range (i.e.
 100-200) or combinations (i.e. 100,102-105,110,130-150,500). Users will
 see the following additional prompts when running the report and opting 
 to select stop codes by range.
  
 'Would you like to select the Stop Codes by range ? No//'
 'Select individual Stop Code or a range of Codes :'

 Performance Monitor Retransmit Report (AAC) [SCRPW PM RETRANSMIT REPORT]
  
 This menu option is used for transmitting Performance Monitor (TIU) data

 addition, this option allows to retroactively transmit previous months
 reports.
