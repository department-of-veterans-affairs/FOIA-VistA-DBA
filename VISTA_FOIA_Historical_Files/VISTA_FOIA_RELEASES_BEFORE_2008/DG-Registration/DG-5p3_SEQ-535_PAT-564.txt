 * In order to ensure that exemptions for unemployable veterans are      *
 * updated by the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) processes, coding      *
 * changes were necessary in 5 VistA software modules (DG, SD, IVM, IB   *
 * and PRCA) as well as the software at the HEC.                         *
 * The compliance date has been shortened due to the urgent nature of    *
 * the enhancement, and the fact that the HEC cannot install their       *
 * enhancements until ALL sites have completed installation of the VistA *
 * patches.                                                              *

 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
 HEC VistA Enhancements (HVE) provides software to support several critical
 business processes associated with congressionally mandated initiatives.
 Through the course of a three phase roll-out, a series of system
 application updates have been and are being made to support enhanced
 Enrollment functionality, both within VistA and the Health Eligibility
 Center (HEC), and updates to a series of veterans' enrollments, including 
 continuous enrollment, and eligibilities, including statuses of Combat 
 Veteran, former Prisoner of War (POW), Unemployable Veteran and Filipino 
 Veteran.
  
 The HVE Phase 3 project functionality enhancements include:
  
 - Unemployable Veteran Service Connection (SC) Priority Group Change
 - POW Veteran Pharmacy Copayment Exemption and Dental Treatment
 - Filipino Veteran Data Sharing with the HEC
 - Combat Veteran (Phase III) Enrollment Priority Updates and Data Sharing
   with the HEC
 - Military Service Date (MSD) Sharing with the HEC and, 
 - Continuous Enrollment Priority Updates 
  
 The HVE Phase 3 functionality will be introduced at all sites as part of 
 a combined effort that encompasses updates to:
  
 - Registration (Patch DG*5.3*564); IVM (IVM*2.0*97); Scheduling 
   (SD*2.0*395) (Distributed as Host File DG_53_P564.KID);
 - Integrated Billing (Patch IB*2.0*275); and, 
 - Accounts Receivable (Patch PRCA*4.5*218). 
  
 As there is no hard dependency between the patches, it is important to note
 that some functionality respective to a given patch may not be fully functional 
 until all patches are installed at the respective site. Each patch description
 will reference any such dormant functionality as part of its more detailed 
 functional explanation.

 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The functional changes that will be implemented in this patch, DG*5.3*564,
 include:
  
 1. The enrollment priority algorithm has been modified to assign qualified
    unemployable veterans to priority 1 and assign eligible combat veterans
    to priority 6.
 2. Unemployable and Combat Veteran End Date have been added as fields to
    the Patient Enrollment file.
 3. Unemployable and Combat Veteran End Date have been added to the display
    of a veteran's enrollment as eligibility factors.
 4. The Pharmacy copayment test algorithm has been modified to exempt
    veterans who are unemployable or have POW status.
 5. The Z07 builder has been modified to add the Filipino Vet Proof field.
 6. The algorithm to calculate the Combat Veteran End Date was modified to
    update the date only if there is no date on file.
 7. The Z11 receiver was modified to add the Combat Veteran End Date.
 8. A new report was added to list veterans who have Combat Veteran End
    Dates that are not supported by the Military Service Data on file.
 9. A new MUMPS cross-reference was added to all the Military Service data
    fields in the Patient that will enable a Z07 message to be sent to HEC
    if any of the data in the fields are changed.
 10. The Agent Orange Exposure Location field was made required if the AO
     Exposure indicator is 'YES'.
 11. The consistency check that requires the veteran to have a Vietnam POS
     in order to have AO Exposure will be removed.
 12. A post-install process will set the AO Exposure Location field to
     VIETNAM for all veterans whose AO Exposure Indicated field is "YES 
     and whose AO Location is null.
 13. The consistency check that requires the veteran to have Persian
     Gulf or Somalia service in order to have EC Exposure will be removed.
