Subject: VISTA DATA EXTRACTION FRAMEWORK SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the VistA Data Extraction Framework (VDEF)
 effort, allowing changes to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to be transmitted
 to the Health Data Repository (HDR). The activation of the transmission 
 will be handled with the sites on an individual basis. Until that 
 activation occurs, the changes included in this patch will not affect 
 any Outpatient Pharmacy functionality.
  
 There will be another Outpatient Pharmacy patch, (PSO*7*190), that will 
 contain the final Outpatient Pharmacy VDEF functionality. In that patch, 
 there will be documentation made available for this project.
  
 This patch addresses one other issue. When the Computerized Patient
 Record System (CPRS) job ORTIME RUN sends messages to Outpatient Pharmacy
 to get a status update on expiring prescriptions, the return message was
 not being sent. Based on the timing of when the messages are sent though,
 the statuses would already be in sync, so it is only a technical problem
 that is being resolved here.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
  Because this patch modifies routines involved in the exchange of messages
  between Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Outpatient
  Pharmacy, this patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient
  Pharmacy users on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders
  are not being acted upon through CPRS. There are also three tasked jobs
  that generate message exchanges between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy, and
  this patch should be installed at a time when these jobs are not running.
  These jobs are PSO AUTOCANCEL, PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS, and ORMTIME RUN.
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 3 minutes.
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*181)
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*181.
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
