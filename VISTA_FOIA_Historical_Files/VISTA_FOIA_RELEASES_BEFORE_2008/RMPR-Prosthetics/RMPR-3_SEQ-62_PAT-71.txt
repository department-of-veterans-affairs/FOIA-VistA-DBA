 This patch provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  You can retrieve
 for viewing the details of each NPPD item based on a user-selected 
 date range.  The retrieved records are viewed as a grid and can
 be sorted, printed, or saved in a CVS file that can be used directly by
 Excel.
  
  
 NOTE:  YOU MUST INSTALL THE EXE FOR THE GUI TO FUNCTION.  INSTRUCTIONS
        ARE INCLUDED IN THE INSTALLATION GUIDE
  
  
 This patch contains the following enhancements to NPPD:
  
 [01] View the detail of selected records
      -----------------------------------
 The NPPD Detail Display (GUI) permits the user to select from two 
 calendar dates, the beginning and ending date range of records to view.  
 The dates are checked to be sure that they are valid, the beginning
 date is before the ending date, and the date range is less than 100 
 days to prevent slow network response.
  
 Upon selecting the dates, the user presses the 'Display' button and a 
 grid is populated with the selected records for viewing only.  The user 
 can change the sort order, along with the column size and location.
  
  
 [02] The results can be printed or saved
      -----------------------------------
 After the grid has been populated and altered to the user's liking, the 
 user can print the grid as displayed, or save the grid as a file with the 
 type 'CVS' which will then automatically launch Excel (if installed).  
 The 'CVS' file is saved with the name format of - 
 BeginingDate_EndingDate.CVS, in the folder C:\NPPDDownload (which is auto 
 created).  The file can be recalled for later use from that location.
  
 [03] Transported Options:
      --------------------
 Option NPPD Tools [RMPR NPPD TOOLS] is being transported as a link.
  
 Option NPPD Detail Display [RMPR NPPD GUI] is a 'B' type option for use
 after installation of RMPR*3*71.  For users to be able to use the NPPD
 Detail Display GUI front-end, this option must be on either their primary
 or secondary menu options.  This option has also been placed on RMPR NPPD
 TOOLS to give users who have access to the current NPPD options, access to
 NPPD GUI Detail Display.  Note: 'B' type options are not visible to roll &
 scroll users.
  
 [04] Remote Procedure:
      -----------------
 Remote Procedure [RMPR NPPD LIST] is being used by the broker to pass the 
 following data in a ^TMP($J global, delimited by "^":
          ;piece 1 = ENTRY DATE
          ;piece 2 = PATIENT NAME
          ;piece 3 = PSAS HCPCS with * if hcpcs has Calculation Flag
