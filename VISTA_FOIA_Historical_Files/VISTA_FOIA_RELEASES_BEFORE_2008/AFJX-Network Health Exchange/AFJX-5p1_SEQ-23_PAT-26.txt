Subject: Install a Patient Identification (PATID) filter

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

        NOIS FAR-1200-40490 
                Fargo VAMC reported that they have received data on
        the wrong patient when they received NHE requests from
        Minneapolis. This patch will install a patient
        identification filter (PATID) that will match the patient
        identity on each Health Summary segment with the patient
        identifier (Name, Date of birth, Social Security Number) of
        the patient requested. If any of the Health Summary
        segments do not return data for the patient requested, then
        none of the data will be returned to the requestor. A
        message that instructs the requestor to resend the request
        is sent instead.
   
          This patch also includes an option for the receiving site
        that will report on the number of possible bad data
        messages that have been received by the site.
   
          This option works by comparing the patient's age with the
        age calculated from the Date of Birth that was reported in
        the Demographics segment of the NHE request. Note that if
        the request is made within a few weeks of the patient's
        birthday, and the age calculated by the Date of Birth
        differs by one year from the patient's actual age, then
        this report option may falsly indicate that the record was
        invalid when in fact it was valid (data is for the correct
        patient).
   
          Since the server filter uses three data elements (Name,
        Social Security Number, and Date of birth), it is much more
        accurate than the report option at catching NHE data
        messages for the wrong patient. If the server site has
        loaded this patch then you can assume that the patient is
        correct regardless of what this report displays.
   
          How to tell if the server site has loaded this patch:
   
          Messages will have a line inserted after the patient ID:
