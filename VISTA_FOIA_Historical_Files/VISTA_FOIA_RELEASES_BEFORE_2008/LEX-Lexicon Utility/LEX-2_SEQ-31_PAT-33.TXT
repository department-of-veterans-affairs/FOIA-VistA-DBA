       The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
       location at the following locations.

     Installation Instructions:
     ==========================
   
        1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*33.
            It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
            hours.  This patch should take less than 10 minutes to install.
    
        2)  Backup the following globals before continuing:
     
                  ICD-9 Diagnosis               #80            ^ICD9(
                  ICD-9 Operations/Procedures   #80.1          ^ICD0(
                  DRG Grouper                   #80.2          ^ICD(
   
        3)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
            not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you 
            will need to kill this global before proceeding.
     
            To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM on a Cache System:
     
               The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system
               wide setting, but can be allowed for a particular process
               using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling 
               unsubscripted global kills is:
     
                   VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                   VAH>K ^LEXM
     
               The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
               is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and
               creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
     
        4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_33.GBL.  This 
            file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
               Cache Thin Client
  
                   Right-click on the Cache cube, then select "Explorer."
                   Open the "Namespaces" folder, then open the "VAH" folder,
                   and right click on the "Globals" folder. Select the
                   "Import from disk" option. Click on the "Options..."
                   button.  Select the "Globals" tab, make sure the format
                   is Cache, then click "OK." Find the file in the directory,
                   double click on LEX_2_33.GBL.  Next, select "Import All"
                   at the prompt "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select
                   "Yes."
  
               Cache Programmer Mode
 
                   Execute the following routine:
  
                      >D ^%GI
  
                       Global input
  
                       Device: C:\DIRECTORY\LEX_2_33.GBL Parameters: ("R")=>
                       Globals were saved on Description
                       with description: DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS PA
  
                       Input option: A
                       ^LEXM
  
            The loading of the global should take from 1 to 2 minutes.
    
        5)  Turn journaling off for globals ^ICD9, ^ICD0 and ^ICD.
     
              Cache v3.2  ONLY !!!  - Journaling
   
                Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache cube,
                then select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local Databases" 
                folder, then open the folder where the ^IC* globals reside. 
                Right click ^ICD, select "Properties," and uncheck the 
                "Journal global" box.  Repeat for ^ICD9 and ^ICD0 globals.
  
              Cache v4.1  ONLY !!!  - Journaling
   
                Journaling on a VMS/Cache system running version 4.1 of 
                Cache cannot be disabled by individual global.  Journaling
                CAN BE disabled for a user's current process.  In this case
                the process will be the installation of this patch.  It is
                important to know that in order for this to work, the 
                KIDS installation CANNOT be tasked off.  The installation 
                MUST be run on your screen in order for the disabled 
                journaling to be in effect. 
  
                To determine if your process has journaling enabled you 
                can call:
  
                  >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                      0 means journaling is disabled, 
                      1 means it's on
  
                To disable journaling for the current process:
  
                  >D DISABLE^%NOJRN
  
                Double check your process to be sure journaling is 
                disabled:
  
                  >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                      0 means journaling is disabled, 
                      1 means it's on
   
                Proceed with the installation remembering NOT to task off
                the install.
  
        6)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
    
        7)  Distribution Load:
    
            Load the KIDS distribution using the Installation Menu action
            "Load a Distribution" and the host file name LEX_2_33.KID.
 
        8)  KIDS Installation:
    
            Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action 
            "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*33.  The KIDS
            installation should take less than five minutes (with 
            journaling off) depending on the number of users/jobs on the
            system.
    
              Environment Check:  
     
                LEX*2.0*33 data exists (by global translation):
   
                  If the data for LEX*2.0*33 has been installed and is
                  translated into the current account, then only package 
                  components and system variables will be checked.
   
                LEX*2.0*33 data does not exist:
   
                  If the data for LEX*2.0*33 can not be found (either in 
                  the current account or by translation) then the environment
                  check routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build
                  namespace and global checksum.  This is to insure that the
                  correct import global is loaded and that all of the data 
                  contained in the import global arrived at your site during
                  the FTP transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the 
                  wrong import global or the global fails the checksum, the
                  install will stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP
                  another copy of the import global (see the section on FTP
                  Software Retrieval and steps 3 and 4 of the Installation 
                  Instructions).
              
            Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
            install? YES//" prompt.
      
            Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu 
            Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
    
        9)  Cleanup
    
            a)  Check that the export global ^LEXM has been killed 
                automatically. 
     
                If it has not been automatically killed you will need to 
                kill the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent 
                import global checksum errors on future installations.
                (see step 3 for "unsubscripted" kills)
     
            b)  If journaling was turned off prior to installation, then
                the journaling must be turned back on when the installation
                is complete.
     
                Cache v3.2  ONLY !!!  - Journaling
   
                  Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache cube,
                  then select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local Databases" 
                  folder, then open the folder where the ^IC* globals reside. 
                  Right click ^ICD, select "Properties," and make sure the
                  "Journal global" box is checked.  Repeat for ^ICD9 and
                  ^ICD0 globals.
  
                Cache v4.1  ONLY !!!  - Journaling
   
                  When the installation of this patch has completed
                  (interactively - not tasked) you may enable journaling
                  for the current process.
  
                  To determine if your process has journaling disabled you 
                  can call:
  
                    >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                        0 means journaling is disabled, 
                        1 means it's on
  
                  To enable journaling for the current process:
  
                    >D ENABLE^%NOJRN
  
                  Double check your process to be sure journaling is 
                  enabled:
  
                    >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                        0 means journaling is disabled, 
                        1 means it's on
   
            c)  If routines LEX2033 and LEX2033P are found on your system, 
                they may be deleted upon completion of the installation. 
                These routines are the environment check and post-install
                routines for this installation.
