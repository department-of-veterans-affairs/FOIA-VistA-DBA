Description:
============

 Patch TIU*1*220 is sent out in a combined build with USR*1*30. Together,
 the two patches permit authorized users to correct the Expected Cosigner
 of UNCOSIGNED documents without having access to the document text.
  
 I. DESCRIPTION
 ==============
 Patches TIU*1*220 and USR*1*30 are written in response to Part 1 of NSR
 (#20060403) - Restricting Access to Text Body for Signed Documents:
   Part 1 - Modify current TIU option used to change the assigned expected 
     cosigner so the CAC and/or other designees are not given access to 
     editing the original note text. 
  
 Patch USR*1*30 creates a new USR action EDIT COSIGNER, which may be used 
 to grant authorization to a select set of users to edit the Expected
 Cosigner of UNCOSIGNED documents.
  
 Patch TIU*1*220 adds new List Manager (LM) action EDIT COSIGNER to TIU
 VISTA options.  It is a hidden action, meaning it is not displayed at the 
 bottom of the screen with other actions.  Users may see what hidden 
 actions are available by entering '??' at the Select Action prompt.
  
 The new action is available under options from the TIU Manager Menu:
      Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) ... [TIU MAIN MENU MGR]
  
 For example, it is a hidden action on Manager menu option
      Search for Selected Documents [TIU SEARCH LIST MGR]
  
 Select Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) Option: 4  Search for 
 Selected Documents

 types Progress Notes, Discharge Summaries, and Consults.  Only documents
 with status UNCOSIGNED or UNSIGNED (provided there are existing rules
 allowing editing of unsigned documents) may be edited using this action.  
 In this action, only UNCOSIGNED documents are audited.

 Software
 ========
 Patches TIU*1*220 and USR*1*30 are distributed in a host file. The host
 file contains two KIDS builds.
  
          First Build: USR*1.0*30
          Second Build: TIU*1.0*220
  
              Host File Name            Download Format
           ----------------------------------------------
              TIU_10_220.KID                  ASCII
  
  
 This host file can be downloaded as described below under section
 DOCUMENTATION.  Use ASCII format and use file name TIU_10_220.KID.
  
 Documentation
 =============
 The TIU and Authorization/Subsciption Utility (ASU) User Manuals have been
 updated to reflect the enhancements provided by these patches.  The
 updated documentation is available in the form of (.PDF) files, as
 follows:
  
  
    PDF File    Manual                                   Download Format
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    TIUUM.PDF   TIU Clinical Coordinator & User Manual   BINARY
    ASUUM.PDF   TIU Clinical Coordinator Manual          BINARY
  
 These two files can be retrieved in BINARY format by FTP. The preferred
 method is to FTP the files from
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov    
  
 which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP location
 at the following locations:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------

    The documentation can also be found on the System Design and
    Development Web page: (http://www.va.gov/vdl).
  
  
 IV. COMBINED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 ====================================== 
 Patch USR*1*30 creates USR action EDIT COSIGNER, IEN #27, assuming the
 site's USR ACTION file 8930.8 is correct and up to date.
  
 The environment check makes sure the USR ACTION file has the correct
 actions with the correct IENS.  The last record in the file should be LINK
 TO FLAG, IEN #26.  This was exported in patch USR*1*27 as part of Patient
 Record Flags Phase II. If the check finds incorrect actions or IENS, it
 will abort the installation. If this occurs, please enter a Remedy ticket 
 for assistance by Enterprise VistA Support (EVS).
  
  
 If the file already has action EDIT COSIGNER, IEN #27, the action is
 overwritten.  If the file is correct and does not yet have action EDIT
 COSIGNER, the patch will install it as IEN 27.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. It should be loaded
 during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users, although any
 disruption should be very minimal. It should take less than 2 minutes to
 install.
  
 The builds are installed in the following order:
  USR*1.0*30
  TIU*1.0*220
  
  USR*1.0*30 requires USR*1.0*27
  TIU*1.0*220 requires USR*1.0*30
  
  
  Installation Steps:
  ===================
   1. Download file TIU_10_220.KID to the appropriate directory on 
      your system.  See section COMBINED SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION
      RETRIEVAL, above.
  
   2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
      enter: TIU_10_220.KID

   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the
      Installation menu.
  
   5. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options if you
      wish. (When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter USR*1.0*30.)

      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
      d. Print Transport Global
  
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package USR*1.0*30.
  
   7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//', respond NO.
  
   8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', answer NO.

 V. POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =================================
  Sites will need to add business rules for USR action EDIT COSIGNER before
  users can edit UNCOSIGNED documents using new List Manager action EDIT
  COSIGNER. Please see patch USR*1*30 for details on USR action EDIT
  COSIGNER and for recommended Business Rules. The new List Manager 
  action EDIT COSIGNER can be used to edit the Cosigner of UNSIGNED
  documents provided there are existing rules allowing the editing of
  UNSIGNED documents.
