Subject: INCORRECT HEADER ON 0305 WORKSHEET WHEN PRINTING ALL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When using OPTION: Print/Reprint C&P Work Sheets [DVBA C PRINT WORKSHEETS]
 with more than one exam, and exam "LIVER, GALL BLADDER, AND PANCREAS",
 worksheet 0305, is involved, then the body of this worksheet is correct but
 the exam name is incorrect. The system prints the header of 0305 exam as 
 the first exam in the printed series. It happens only when you print ALL.
  When 0305 is printed individually, it is okay.
  
 This patch corrects 0305 reporting program: DVBCWLQ where a header was 
 assigned incorrectly when more exams were printed.
