  - Routine

Description:
============

  RG*1.0*28 and RG*1.0*30 are required builds for patch RG*1*31.
   
  NOTE:  MPIF* and RG* patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master
  of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
   
  ISSUE 1:  Prisoner of War (POW) status was not passed in all the ADT 
  messages sent to the Master Patient Index (MPI).  The POW STATUS 
  INDICATED? (#.525) field is passed in the ZPD segment which will
  now be included in the ADT messages via the RGADT1 routine.
   
  ISSUE 2:  Routine RGMTMONT has been enhanced to provide more remote
  data quality monitoring of possible PATIENT (#2) file data overwrites
  for the MPI Data Quality Management Team.
   
  ISSUE 3:  Routine RGMTMONX has been enhanced to provide data on the 
  treating facility entries with a station number of 200.
   
  ISSUE 4:  On a monthly basis, a query is sent from the MPI to each
  facility to compile statistical information for the MPI Data Quality
  Management team.  Routine RGMTUTO1 has been enhanced to check for
  successful completion of the data compilation.  If the compile was
  terminated for any reason, the incomplete data is cleared so the query
  can be resent from the MPI Query Sites for Stat Report Data [MPIM QUERY
  FOR STAT RPTS] option.
   
  ISSUE 5:  Routines RGEX05 and RGRPDAT have been enhanced to display the
  first line of the remote patient data display and to handle long displays
  (when the remote call returns a global array instead of a local array).
  The routines are called when performing a remote MPI/PD Data Inquiry from
  within the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option or the
  Display Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] option.
