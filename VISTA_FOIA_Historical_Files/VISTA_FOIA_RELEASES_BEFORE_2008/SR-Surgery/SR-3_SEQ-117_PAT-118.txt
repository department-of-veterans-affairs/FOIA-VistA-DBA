Subject: FIX OTHER PROC TO DISPLAY MORE THEN 15 ENTRIES AND NAME TRUNCATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects two problems. It corrects the problem in the 
 display when entering "Other Procedures" in the Operation [SROMEN-OP]
 Option. The display is limited to 15 entries, and sometimes more
 than 15 "Other Procedures" entries are needed. The patch also corrects
 a problem that occurs when printing the PCE Filing Status report. 
 Long names should list the initial for the patient's first name.  
 Currently, the report drops the first name completely.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1) FGH-0502-32592     +15 ENTRIES OF OTHER PROCEDURES
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when entering "Other Procedures" in the Operation 
 [SROMEN-OP] Option. Entry and display is limited to 15 entries, and 
 sometimes more than 15 "Other Procedure" entries are needed.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine SRCUSS0 so that when entering "Other Procedures", the
 program will allow more then 15 entries.  It will also display the other
 procedures entered in increments of 16 and prompt the user to select
 or return to continue.
  
 2) REN-0503-61617     PARTITIAL PATIENT NAME PRINTED
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs in the PCE Filing Status Report when a patients name 
 is longer than 20 spaces. It is supposed to display the patients last name
 and first initial when longer than 20 spaces. Instead, it only displays the 
 last name. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine DEM^SROPCE0B to use "," instead of "^" for the delimiter 
 when parsing names greater then 20 characters.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
   
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                                
           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution 
           Backup a Transport Global  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*118):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*118.
  
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
          YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated).
      b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? YES//', answer NO
  
  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
     
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
