 DEVELOPERS: SEE BELOW FOR DESCRIPTION OF A NEW API
 Summary:
  
 1. Enhancements to Systems Link Monitor:
        -more information in header to help distinguish multiple displays.
        -provides both a full and abbreviated display format, as well as a
         help screen
 2. Additional required Messaging site parameters added to file 869.3.
 3. Updated option "Edit Communication Server Parameters" to support new
    site parameters.
 4. New field in 869.3 to support a local mail group for Messaging system
    alerts and notifications.
 5. New public FUNCTION CALL to retrieve an application-specific mail group
    for alerts and notifications pertaining to initiating or processing a
    particular transaction. This mail group field is found in the HL
 APPLICATION PARAMETER file and is edited via the Interface Workbench.
 This is not a new field. There has just never been an API to retrieve
 this information until now. The second piece returned is the
 active/inactive flag.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
 NOTE: Prior to installing this patch and updating your new site
 parameters, create a new mail group with at least one recipient to
 receive Messaging System alerts. Support for this feature will be added in
 future enhancements. Note that this mail group is for issues
 specific to the Messaging System. It does not have to be the same mail
 group used by Applications as described above.
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
        Disable your Logical Links using the option, Shut Down All Logical
        Links.
        Disable your HL7 Inbound and Outbound Filers using the options:
                Stop all Incoming Filers
                Stop all Outgoing Filers
    2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed
        in the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed
        from the mapped set at this time.
    3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
    4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
     
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
           INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*40
                         =========
           Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
           and Protocols?'.
    5.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
    6.  At the conclusion of this installation, go to the Screenman option,
        EDIT COMMUNICATIONS SERVER PARAMETERS, and complete entries for the
        new site parameters provided. The screen will appear as follows:
  
 Select OPTION NAME: EDIT COMMUNICATION SERVER PARA  HL EDIT COMM SERVER 
    PARAMETERS        Edit Communication Server parameters
  
  
                          Edit HL7 Site Parameters
  
  
                       Current Domain: <enter your Domain name>
  
                  Current Institution: <enter the name of your institution>
  
 Is this a Production or Test Account? <enter 'P' or 'T'
  
    Default Number of Incoming Filers: 1 
  
    Default Number of Outgoing Filers: 1 
  
                Mail Group for Alerts:
  
  
  
 __________________________________________________________________________
 7. To resume messaging, use the option "Restart all Links and Filers."
 Note that any logical links that do not have the "autostart" parameter set
 to Enabled must be started manually using the option "Start LLP."
