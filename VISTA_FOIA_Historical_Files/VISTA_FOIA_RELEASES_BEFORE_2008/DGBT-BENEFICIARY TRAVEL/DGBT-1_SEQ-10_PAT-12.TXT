Associated patches: (v)DGBT*1*8    <<= must be installed BEFORE `DGBT*1*12'

Subject: FIX DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 There was a conflict in the evaluation of the error message in the 
 temporary global vs actual appointment data for a patient or clinic.  If 
 there was an internal patient ID of 101, or an internal clinic ID of 101, 
 then the routines would mistakenly treat those appointments as an error.  
 When this happens no appointment information is returned, and the 
 following error message is returned:
  
           SDAMAPI - Appointment Database is Unavailable.
  
 The software is being modified to correctly identify the returned 
 appointment data for errors.  The modifications will check if the 
 Temporary global (^TMP($J)) contains a database error message and doesn't 
 conflict with any patient or clinic appointments
