Subject: COPAY SERVICE CONNECTED CORRECTION;TALLY OF BILLABLE FILLS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. One site has reported an excessive number of prescriptions getting
 automatically (incorrectly) changed at release from Copay to No Copay 
 with a reason of "Service Connected". It was determined that this is
 happening because the Service Connected question does not apply for the
 patient anymore, but the Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0(CPRS)
 passes the Service Connected question's answer from the renewed from or
 copied from prescription to Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0.
  
 Solution:
  
 This patch corrects the problem but will not do any back-billing. 
 Information gathered from the results of this patch will be used by the 
 VHA Central Office to determine whether back-billing will be done for 
 these fills. A subsequent patch may be released to perform this 
 back-billing.
  
   a. At release of a fill, if the Service Connected flag has a "Yes"
 answer, a call will be made to Integrated Billing to see if the Service
 Connected question even applies for this patient anymore. If not, the
 answer will be set to null in Outpatient Pharmacy and an update
 transaction will be sent to CPRS to change their copy of the answer to 
 null.
  
   b. A post-install job will loop through all released prescriptions
 starting from 02/04/2002 (the date that the $7 copay amount went into
 effect) and will tally the number of fills that could have been billed. 
 The results of this patch will be maintained in a temporary location for 
 a limited time in order to speed the processing of any eventual 
 back-billing.
  
  
 A MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: Outpatient Pharmacy Copay 
 Tally" will be sent to the patch installer and holders of the PSO COPAY
 key indicating the number of fills that have a potential for being
 back-billed.
  
 A second MailMan message will be sent to developers of the patch on FORUM 
 with a subject of "Subj: 'institution' - COUNTS". This message will 
 contain formatted tallies of fills eligible to be back-billed for 2002 
 and 2003.
  
 The MailMan messages will not contain any patient information. 
  
 2. A problem was encountered when a patient who had previously reached
 his annual copay cap had activity that brought his copay amount below the
 annual cap. When that happens, Integrated Billing (IB) will look for any
 previous fills that weren't billed because of the cap and will attempt to
 bill for those. The problem occurred when the previous unbilled fill had
 been returned to stock, Outpatient Pharmacy had an error in the process
 that should have sent a cancel for those "potential bills" (fills that
 would have been billed if the patient had not already reached his annual
 copay cap), so IB attempted to initiate a charge for those. On returned to
 stock refills, the refill level is removed from the prescription file, so
 filing the IB-initiated charge caused undefined errors.
  
 Solution:
 The canceling portion of the return to stock processing was corrected to
 handle "potential charges".

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running
  tasks. Do not install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are
  using the software. 
   
  Installation should take no longer than 5 minutes. Please do not queue
  the job of installing this patch. There is a post-install background
  job that will prompt for a date@time to run. You MUST respond with a date
  and time or NOW to queue the post-install job. You will not be able to
  see what you are answering for the prompt, but will be given an
  opportunity to see what was entered before the job queues.
  
  It is recommended that the post-install be queued to run at a time when
  Outpatient Pharmacy package usage is at a minimum. This job may run for 
  several hours.
   
  If the post-install job needs to be queued manually (e.g. the patch 
  install itself was accidentally queued), then it can be queued by     
  entering D ^PSOCPBAK from programmer mode.
  
  Upon completion of the post-install job, a MailMan message with a subject
  of "Subj: Outpatient Pharmacy Copay Tally" will be sent to the patch
  installer and holders of the PSO COPAY key with the number of fills that
  were found to be potentially billable. 
  
  An example of the install process is included here under the title
  "Example Installation".
  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*137)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*137.
  
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. The environment check routine will now prompt the installer of the 
      patch for a date@time to run the post-install job. If no start date 
      and time is entered when prompted, the job will be queued to run NOW.
  
   9. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to completion.
