  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements for the VistA
 Integrated Billing (IB) software application as they apply to the use of
 the National Provider Identifier (NPI) and provider taxonomy codes. The
 NPI is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 (HIPAA) requirement with a usage requirement date of May 23, 2008.
  
 The purpose of the software and database modifications is to utilize the
 NPI and provider taxonomy codes on the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
 X12 transmissions as defined by HIPAA. The NPI numbers are issued by the
 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the taxonomy codes are
 released by the National Uniform Claims Committee (NUCC). These
 transmissions include the X12 837, 835 and 270 electronic forms.
  
 Providers fall into two categories; individual providers and
 organizational providers. The individual providers are the individual
 persons who receive and utilize NPIs, e.g. medical doctors, dentists,
 physician assistants, nurse practitioners, etc. The organizational
 providers are institutions which may bill under their own ID, e.g.
 hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, etc. The taxonomy code provides a
 specialty breakout for individual and organizational providers. The 
 taxonomy code will replace the built in intelligence within the payer
 issued IDs. The payers, at times, do issue multiple IDs for one provider
 in order to determine the treating specialty the provider was utilizing
 during a course of treatment that was being billed. The taxonomy code
 used in conjunction with the NPI will provide this treating specialty
 identification.
  
 List of Patch Items:
  
 1.  Data dictionary definitions were changed to include NPI and
     taxonomy-related fields:
  
     a. The following fields were added to the IB NON/OTHER BILLING
        PROVIDER (#355.93) file:
  
            NPI (#41.01)
            - This field contains the current NPI for this provider.
  
            DATE/TIME OF LAST NPI CHANGE (#40)
            - This multiple contains a history of changes made to the
              NPI field.
  
            TAXONOMY CODE (#42)
            - This multiple contains the list of taxonomy codes
              associated with this provider.
  
     b. The following fields were added to the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file:
  
            DEFAULT DIVISION TAXONOMY (#243)
            - This is the taxonomy associated with field DEFAULT DIVISION
              (#.22) for this claim.
  
            NON-VA FACILITY TAXONOMY (#244)
            - This is the taxonomy associated with field NON-VA FACILITY
              (#232) for this claim. 
  
            PROVIDER (#222) multiple field TAXONOMY (#.15)
            - This is the taxonomy associated with the individual specified
              in field PERFORMED BY (#.02) in the PROVIDER multiple.
  
     c. A trigger was added to the following fields in the BILL/CLAIMS
        (#399) file:
  
            DEFAULT DIVISION (#.22)
            - When edited, automatically populates field DEFAULT DIVISION
              TAXONOMY (#243) with the primary taxonomy associated with
              the Division selected.
  
            NON-VA FACILITY (#232)
            - When edited, automatically populates field NON-VA FACILITY
              TAXONOMY (#244) with the primary taxonomy associated with
              the Non-VA Facility selected.
  
            PROVIDER (#222) multiple field PERFORMED BY (#.02)
            - When edited, automatically populates field TAXONOMY (#.15)
              with the primary taxonomy associated with the Provider
              selected.
  
 2.  The option Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] has
     been modified to include the following:
  
     a. Screen 6 (inpatient) has been changed to display the X12 Code
        and Specialty Code associated with field DEFAULT DIVISION TAXONOMY
        in information group 1 directly below the current Division. The
        input template associated with that group allows the user to
        override the DEFAULT DIVISION TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
     b. Screen 7 (outpatient) has been changed to display the X12 Code
        and Specialty Code associated with field DEFAULT DIVISION TAXONOMY
        in information group 1 directly below the current Division. The
        input template associated with that group allows the user to
        override the DEFAULT DIVISION TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
     c. For UB92 (UB-04) claims, screen 8 has been changed to display
        the X12 Code and Specialty Code associated with field TAXONOMY
        in information group 2 (Providers) next to the current Provider
        Name. The input template associated with that group allows the
        user to override the TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
     d. For UB92 (UB-04) claims, screen 8 has been changed to display
        the X12 Code and Specialty Code associated with field NON-VA
        FACILITY TAXONOMY in information group 8 (Other Facility) next
        to the current facility name. The input template associated with
        that group allows the user to override the NON-VA FACILITY
        TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
     e. For HCFA 1500 (CMS 1500) claims, screen 8 has been changed to
        display the X12 Code and Specialty Code associated with field
        TAXONOMY in information group 3 (Providers) next to the current
        Provider Name. The input template associated with that group
        allows the user to override the TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
     f. For HCFA 1500 (CMS 1500) claims, screen 8 has been changed to
        display the X12 Code and Specialty Code associated with field
        NON-VA FACILITY TAXONOMY in information group 4 (Other Facility)
        next to the current facility name. The input template associated
        with that group allows the user to override the NON-VA FACILITY
        TAXONOMY for the current claim.
  
 3.  The Authorization Edits in option Enter/Edit Billing Information
     [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] have been changed to check whether DEFAULT
     DIVISION, NON-VA FACILITY, and each PROVIDER on a Bill have an
     associated NPI number and taxonomy code. If the bill date falls
     before the May 23, 2008 usage requirement date, then any missing NPI
     number or taxonomy code will trigger a warning which the user may
     override to submit the claim. If the date falls after the
     May 23, 2008 date, then any missing NPI number or taxonomy code will
     trigger an error which will prevent the claim from being submitted
     until the missing NPI number or taxonomy code has been added.
  
 4.  The option Provider ID Maintenance [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT], which is
     also accessible through option Enter/Edit Billing Information
     [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] via screen 8 group 7 [Provider ID Maint],
     has been modified to include the following:
  
     a. For individual providers, the provider's NPI number and taxonomy
        codes are displayed below his specialty information.
  
     b. For individual providers, the Edit Demographics action has been
        changed to allow entering/editing the provider's NPI number and
        taxonomy codes.
  
     c. For facilities, the facility's NPI number and taxonomy codes are
        displayed below the mammography certification number.
  
     d. For facilities, the Provider Info action has been renamed Facility
        Info and the Secondary ID Maint action has been renamed
        ID Maintenance.
  
     e. For facilities, the Facility Info action has been changed to allow
        entering/editing the facility's NPI number and taxonomy codes.
  
 5.  A new segment, NPI, has been added to the 837 transmission. It
     contains the NPI number and taxonomy code associated with DEFAULT
     DIVISION, NON-VA FACILITY, and each PROVIDER on a bill.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine removes the entries from the output formatter
 files IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION (364.5), IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION
 (364.6), and IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (364.7) as well as file IB PROVIDER ID # 
 TYPE (355.97) that are included with this patch. This prevents certain
 problems with pointer resolution.
  
 The pre-installation and post-installation routines combined move data from
 node NPI to node NPISTATUS in file IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER (355.93)
 which is required for Kernel to be able to check for duplicate NPIs in that
 file when NPIs are being entered in files INSTITUTION (4) or NEW PERSON (200).
  
 The pre-installation routine is automatically deleted after this patch
 is installed.
