Description:
============

  This patch builds on patch PSN*4*69 entitled CREATE NEW FIELD IN VA
  PRODUCT FOR EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTION. Whereas PSN*4*69 created the new
  EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTION CK field (#23) in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68),
  this patch enhances two existing options and adds two new options to use
  the new data. The enhanced options Inquire to VA Product Info For Local
  Drug [PSNLOOK] option and Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] option are
  under the Inquiry Options [PSNQUER] submenu. These include the new field in
  the display to the user. The report options are VA Products Excluded from
  Drug-Drug Interactions [PSNEXMPT] option and Local Drugs Excluded from
  Drug-Drug Interactions [PSNODDI] option. These are under the National Drug
  File Reports [PSNSUBM] submenu and identify VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) and
  DRUG file (#50) entries matched to these VA Products. NDF Data Update patch
  PSN*4*72 and PSN*4*73 populate this new field.
  
  A new iteration of the supported API routine (PSNAPIS) is included
  in this patch. A new call ($$DDIEX) has been added to return a
  "1" (one) for EXCLUDE Drug-Drug Interaction Checking. It will return a "0"
  (zero) to continue with Drug-Drug Interaction checking.
  This API is supported by DBIA #2574.
