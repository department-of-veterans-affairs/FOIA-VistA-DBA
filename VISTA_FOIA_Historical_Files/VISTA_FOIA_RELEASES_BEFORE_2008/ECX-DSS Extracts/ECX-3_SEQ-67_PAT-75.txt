    PROBLEM:
    --------

    extracts cannot be transmitted to the Austin Production queue because  
    they are now considered as prior year.

    -----------
    Routine ECXTRANS was modified to correct the problem with transmitting 
    the DSS Extracts.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will

     1. Choose the Packman message containing this patch and invoke the
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2. (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all 
        systems for the routines listed in the Routine Summary. If the
        routines included in this patch are currently in your mapped
        routine set, please skip this step.
  
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*75)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        ECX*3.0*75.
  
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
    
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
     8. (DSM for Open VMS sites only) If any routines were unmapped as 
        part of step 2, they should be returned to the mapped set once the
        installation has run to completion.
