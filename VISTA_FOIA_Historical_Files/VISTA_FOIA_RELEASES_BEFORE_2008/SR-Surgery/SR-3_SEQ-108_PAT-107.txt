Subject: COREFLS-SURGERY INTERFACE/RACE & ETHNICITY ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Input Template

Description: 
============

 This is an enhancement patch to the Surgery V. 3.0 software. It will
 replace the existing Surgery interface with the Integrated Funds 
 Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting, and Procurement (IFCAP)
 with a new interface to the Core Financial and Logistics System (CoreFLS).
 Functionally, the new interface expands the features provided in the
 existing interface. The interface will provide Surgery case information to
 Supply Processing and Distribution (SPD) so that the specific Surgery
 case carts needed for the case can be created. The modifications include
 the following items:
  
 1. The new SPD COMMENTS field (#80) of the SURGERY file (#130) is added to
    the following options:
  
   - Make Operation Requests [SROOPREQ]
   - Delete or Update Operation Requests [SRSUPRQ]
   - Make a Request from the Waiting List [SRSWREQ]
   - Make a Request for Concurrent Cases [SRSREQCC]
   - Schedule Unrequested Operations [SROSRES]
   - Schedule Unrequested Concurrent Cases [SRSCHDC]
   - Reschedule or Update a Scheduled Operation [SRSCHUP]
  
 2. The new AUTOMATED CASE CART ORDERING field (#37) will be added to the 
    SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) input template SRPARAM so that 
    this field may be edited using the Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit)
    [SROPARAM] option. This field will be checked to determine if the
    CoreFLS interface for Surgery is in use at the facility before sending
    the Surgery data to the CoreFLS package.
  
 3. This patch modifies all options used to create or schedule a Surgery
    case so that information can be provided to SPD for the creation of
    Surgery case carts.
  
 4. This patch modifies the Surgery software to send updates to SPD 
    whenever any of the information provided on the messages has been 
    modified using any data entry option.
  
 5. This patch enhances the following options to initiate Health 
    Level 7 (HL7) update messages if the Surgery HL7 interface
    is in use at the facility for the following options:
  
    - Enter PAC(U) Information [SROMEN-PACU]
    - Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS]
    - Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE
      RISK]
    - Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT REASON]
    - Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE] 
  
 6. When using the Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS] 
    option, there is a possibility of getting an undefined error if the 
    length of the race data is found to be more than forty characters.
    This patch fixes this problem. NOIS BAY-0103-31703
  
  
  
 Data Dictionary Changes:
 ========================
  
 1. This patch exports the following new fields:
  
   - SPD COMMENTS multiple field (#80) and DYNAMED NOTIFIED field (#81) of
     the SURGERY file (#130).
   - AUTOMATED CASE CART ORDERING field (#37) of the SURGERY SITE
     PARAMETERS file (#133).
  
 2. New-style cross-references were added as follows:
  
  - SURGEON field (#.14), PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE field (#26), PRINCIPAL
    PROCEDURE CODE field (#27), OPERATING ROOM field (#.02), SURGERY
    SPECIALTY field (#.04), SCHEDULED START TIME field (#10), SCHEDULED END
    TIME field (#11), IN/OUT-PATIENT STATUS field (#.011), CONCURRENT CASE
    field (#35), DATE OF OPERATION field (#.09), and ATTEND SURG field 
    (#.164) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - OTHER PROCEDURE field (#.01) and the OTHER PROCEDURE CPT CODE field
    (#3) in the OTHER PROCEDURES subfile (#130.16) of the SURGERY file
    (#130).
  
  - PRIN. PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER field (#.01) in the PRIN. PROCEDURE CPT
    MODIFIER subfile (#130.028) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - OTHER PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER field (#.01) in the OTHER PROCEDURES  
    subfile (#130.16) in the OTHER PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER subfile 
    (#130.164) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
 3. The input template SRPARAM associated to the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS 
    file (#133) is modified so the AUTOMATED CASE CART ORDERING field (#37)
    may be edited using the Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SROPARAM]
    option.
  
 4. The input templates SREQUEST, SRSRES-ENTRY, SRSCHED-UNREQUESTED, 
    SRSRES-SCHED, and SRSRES1 associated with the SURGERY file (#130) are
    modified so the SPD COMMENTS field (#80) may be edited.

 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation takes
 less than five minutes. This patch can be installed at any time.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*107):
  
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*107.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  9. IMPORTANT !!  In order to activate the Surgery/CoreFLS interface,  
     sites must use the Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SROPARAM]
     option on the Surgery Package Management Menu [SRO PACKAGE MANAGEMENT]
     to set the AUTOMATED CASE CART ORDERING flag to "YES".
