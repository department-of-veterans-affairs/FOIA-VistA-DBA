Description:
============

 This patch will stop Fee Basis package users from entering more vendor
 contract rates than the package can handle, and will prompt users to
 delete obsolete rates when this situation occurs.

 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):

 Overview of NOIS message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. NTH-0997-72558  <STRLEN> RATE+7^FBAAVD1:1
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user wants to add additional vendor contract rates using option 
 Update Vendor Contract/Rates - CNH [FBCNH UPDATE VENDOR CONTRACT], the 
 software is allowing the user to add more rates than can be processed by 
 the package.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change the function of option Update Vendor Contract/Rates - CNH [FBCNH 
 UPDATE VENDOR CONTRACT] to not allow a user to add more vendor contract 
 rates than the package can handle, and when this situation occurs, prompt 
 the user to delete obsolete rates when there is not enough room to add 
 more.
