Description: 
============

 ** Y2K WAIVER - #Y2K0001 **
  
 This patch updates the Broker's programmer client workstation software --
 also known as the Broker Development Kit (BDK) -- adding support for
 Delphi 5 development.
  
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  
 This patch consists of 2 parts:
  
 1.  Packman message containing the XWB*1.1*11 KIDS build.  The packman
 message simply updates the version multiple of the package.
  
 2.  Updated BDK (programmer client workstation software). All sites doing
 Broker development are encouraged to retrieve the patched BDK.  This
 version of the BDK supports Delphi 5, Delphi 4, and Delphi 3.
  
 DO NOT INSTALL THIS PROGRAMMER CLIENT WORKSTATION SOFTWARE AT END-USER
 CLIENT WORKSTATIONS.  If you are not using the BDK in any local or
 national development, you do not need to retrieve the Broker's programmer
 client workstation software. The software does not update the Broker
 software that is running at end-user client workstations.
  
 The software distribution includes:

        Use ASCII mode for .TXT file.
  
 To obtain the updated BDK, use FTP to retrieve the software from one of
 the following CIO Field Offices' ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:

 BROKER-DEPENDENT COMPONENTS:
  
 The following comments apply only to those developing applications with
 the BDK (programmer workstation software).  They are not relevant to
 server operation.
  
 Warning:
 Some components, such as the FileMan Delphi Components, reference the
 TRPCBroker component.  If you use such components for development, be
 aware that installing a new version of the TRPCBroker component (i.e. a
 new BDK) may cause incompatibilities in Delphi, resulting in a compile
 failure of the unit containing the Broker-dependent component and the
 following compilation error:
  
        Unit <unit1> was compiled with a different version of <unit2>.
  
 Check with the creators of the Broker-dependent component to make sure
 that, with regards to the version of the BDK you are about to install:
  
 a) Your current component is compatible, or
  
 b) You can obtain a new version of the component that is compatible.
  
 c) You have the source (.pas, .dfm, .dpk, etc.) files available so that
 the component can be recompiled successfully.
   
 If you're using the FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC), please note that the
 FMDC source code includes references to RPC Broker Development Kit (BDK)
 code. When you install a new version of the BDK, you will need to
 recompile the FMDC.
       
 As of patch FMDC*1.0*1, source code for FMDC is provided, allowing you
 to recompile FMDC if necessary. For instructions on how to recompile FMDC,
 please refer to FMDC*1.0*2.
