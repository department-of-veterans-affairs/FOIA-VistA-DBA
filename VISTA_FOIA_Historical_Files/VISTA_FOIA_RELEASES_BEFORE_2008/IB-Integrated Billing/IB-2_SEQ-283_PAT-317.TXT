Subject: CLAIMS TRACKING ENHANCEMENT

Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This is an enhancement to the Integrated Billing (IB) Claims Tracking 
 Module.  The IB Claims Tracking Module is used to capture Episodes of Care
 for the purpose of determining if the encounters can be billed. The 
 Episode Data is collected through several different processes. Certain 
 events, such as admissions, are captured in real time. Other events, such
 as Outpatient Encounters, are captured through a sweeping process that
 runs daily in the background. Coding Clerks or Coders review the entries
 in the Claims Tracking File and determine if they should be billed.
  
 This enhancement will allow the Coder to enter additional data that will 
 streamline the billing process. The Billing Clerks will be able to see 
 what action was previously taken on an event:  when it was taken, and the
 coder that took the action. This will institute a more efficient follow-up
 process.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 The editing of entries in Claims Tracking has been enhanced to provide new
 prompts for data capture.  The new prompts allow for input of multiple
 Billable Findings.  Billable Findings are possible adjustments to the
 coding of an event that may change the results when the claim is actually
 billed to the Insurance Carrier.  Possible choices for Billable Findings
 are:
  
    1            NO CHANGE
    2            UPCODED
    3            DOWNCODED
    4            WRONG CPT CODE
    5            WRONG DIAGNOSIS CODE
    6            SC TO NSC
    7            NSC TO SC
    8            BILL INSTITUTIONAL  ONLY
    9            WRONG PROVIDER
    10           NO INPT PRO FEES
    11           BILLER CONTACT UR
    12           OLD INCORRECT SC/NSC
    13           CODES ADDED
    14           E&M CODES LEVEL 1&2 UNREVIEWED
    15           LAB/XRAY
    16           BILL TC ONLY
    17           RESEQUENCED CODES
    18           NO REVIEW DONE
  
  
 Claims Tracking Edit [IBT EDIT BI TRACKING ENTRY]
 -------------------------------------------------
 When the user selects a Claims Tracking Event using View/Edit Episode 
 (VE), Claims Tracking Edit will now display any Billable Findings under 
 the Billing Information Section. When the user selects the Billing Info 
 Edit (BI) Option, they will be able to enter/edit the Billable Findings.
  
  
 Along with the entry of the Billable Findings is the availability of 
 three new reports.  The reports are:
  
  
 Un-reviewed Claims for Coders Report [IBT UNREVIEWED CODING REPORT]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 This new report is designed to be run by coding staff to determine which 
 Claims Tracking Events still require review.  The new report is added to a
 new menu named CODING VALIDATION MENU[IBT UNREVIEWED CODING REPORT],
 selected from the PATIENT BILLING REPORTS [IB OUTPUT PATIENT REPORT MENU]
 Menu.  Users will be prompted for the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER START DATE and
 OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER END DATE.
  
 Entered/Not Reviewed Report [IBT ENTERED NOT REVIEWED]
 ------------------------------------------------------
 This new report will allow the MCCF Staff to identify encounters that 
 have been:
   1.  Reviewed by the coders and are ready to bill (indicated by a 
       non-blank findings type); and
   2.  Not reviewed by the coders (indicated by a blank findings type).
 The report prints all Outpatient Reimbursable Insurance Claims in the 
 BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file with a status of Entered/Not Reviewed.  Users will
 be prompted for the Event Date Range.  The new report is added to a new
 menu named CODING VALIDATION MENU, selected from the PATIENT BILLING
 REPORTS Menu.
  
 Quick Review Coding Status Report [IBT QUICK REV CODING STAT]
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 This new report provides the MCCF Staff ability to select a specific 
 patient to see the status of the patient's claims so that they know at a
 glance whether or not they are ready for billing.  Users will be able to
 specify a patient and an Encounter Date Range.  The new report is added to
 a new menu named CODING VALIDATION MENU, selected from the PATIENT BILLING
 REPORTS Menu.
  
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 A new file, CLAIMS TRACKING BILLABLE FINDINGS (#356.85),
 is being exported
 with this patch that is pre-populated with the entries listed in the 
 Functional Description.  Along with this new file, 6 new fields are being 
 added to the CLAIMS TRACKING (#356) File.  Most of the new fields are 
 automatically populated based on a user's input choices utilizing the 
 updated input template [IBT BILLING INFO].
  
 IBBFAPI is being updated.  During testing of this software, there was an 
 issue found in this routine that prevented it from making the proper 
 determination of what an insurance policy will cover.  This incorrect 
 determination can be used by any other application since it is part of a
 supported API Call in the IB Package.
  
 IBTOECT is being added as a new routine to support two of the report 
 options included in this patch.
  
 IBTRED0 has been enhanced to display the Billable Findings, if any.
