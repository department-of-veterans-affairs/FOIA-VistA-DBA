Description:
============

 This patch is being released along with SD*5.3*478 (Scheduling), and 
 PX*1.0*176 (Patient Care Encounter) in host file: SD_53_P478.KID
  
 The Consult/Scheduling Appointment Link modifications include:
  
    1. It provides a new option to set up the linkage between entries in 
       the Consult Services file (#123.5) and the Clinic Stop file (#40.7).
  
    2. For consult services that have stop codes associated with them, the 
       schedulers are asked if they would like to associate a consult or 
       procedure request with an appointment.
  
    3. It automatically updates the status of linked consults or procedures
       when appointments are no-showed, cancelled or rescheduled.  This
       will increase the likelihood that medically sensitive consults are
       re-assessed rather than lost into the system when a patient no-shows
       a "consult-initiated" appointment.
  
    4. It automates the documentation of consult/procedure status for
       appointments that are no-showed or cancelled when patient letters 
       are printed (e.g., if a consult-linked appointment is no-showed the
       consult will automatically be updated with the following comment,
       "No-show letter printed").
  
    5. It sends a notification [via COMMENT] to the initiating provider of
       the consult when an appointment that has been linked to a consult is
       rescheduled, cancelled or marked as a no-show, even if the consult
       is an interfacility consult.
  
    6. It adds a reason for appointment cancellation to the consult when
       using the Scheduling option, Cancel Clinic Availability.
    
    7. It displays "CONS" in the Scheduling package Appointment Profile to
       indicate a consult request has been associated with the appointment.
