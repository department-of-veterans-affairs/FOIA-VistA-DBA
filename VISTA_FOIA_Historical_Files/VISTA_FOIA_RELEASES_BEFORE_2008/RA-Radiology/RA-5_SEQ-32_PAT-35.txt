Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the Radiology side of enhancements that are 
 described in the New Service Request for "CONDENSE RADIOLOGY PROCEDURE 
 DISPLAY IN CPRS AND PRINTED REPORTS."
  
     Previously, all Radiology reports (for the same patient and
     exam date/time) displayed all procedures and their associated
     procedure modifiers and CPT modifiers, whether or not a procedure and
     its modifiers are identical to another procedure and its modifiers.
  
     This patch will condense the display of procedures and their
     associated modifiers where possible.
  
 Routine Changes
 ---------------
  
 1.  Routines RAPROD, RART3, RARTR3 were changed to condense the display
     of procedures, procedure modifiers and CPT modifiers:
  
     Duplicate procedures with matching procedure modifiers and CPT
     modifiers will only be displayed once.  They will be preceded
     with   Nx, where   N   is the number of occurrence of this
     duplication.
  
     The blank line that used to separate one procedure from another
     will no longer be displayed.
  
     Procedure modifier and CPT modifier with the value of "None" will
     not be displayed.
  
      Options affected by changes in routine RART3:
  
           View Exam by Case No. [RA VIEWCN]
           Display a Rad/Nuc Med Report [RA RPTDISP]
           On-line Verifying of Reports [RA RPTONLINEVERIFY]
           Resident On-Line Pre-Verification [RA RESIDENT PRE-VERIFY]
  
      Options affected by changes in routine RARTR3:
                                                -
           Individual Ward [RA RPTDISTSINGLEWARD]
           Print By Routing Queue [RA RPTDISTQUE]
           Single Clinic [RA RPTDISTSINGLECLINIC]
           Draft Report (Reprint) [RA REPRINT]
           Select Report to Print by Patient [RA RPTPAT]
  
      Mail message affected by changes in routine RARTR3:
                                                      -
           The mail message that is sent to the requesting
           physician right after a report is verified.  It
           has the subject title of
               Rad/Nuc Med Report (mmddyy-nnnn)
  
  
 2.  Routine RAUTL11 was changed to prevent a page pause if the user
     specified viewing the ENTIRE REPORT, instead of PAGE AT A TIME in the
     following options:
  
         On-line Verifying of Reports [RA RPTONLINEVERIFY]  
         Resident On-Line Pre-Verification [RA RESIDENT PRE-VERIFY]
  
     Previously, from either of these 2 options, if the user specifies
     ENTIRE REPORT, there would be one or more page pauses, if there are
     more than one screen's worth of procedures and modifiers to display.
  
     This problem was noticed during testing of the changes for item 1.
  
 Option added
 ------------
  
 1.  Option 'Set preference for Long Display of Procedures' [RA SET
     PREFERENCE LONG DISPLAY]  has been added to the menu option
     'User Utility Menu' [RA USERUTL].
  
     This new option will allow the user to set his preference for
     the display of procedures and modifiers to the long (traditional)
     format, instead of the condensed (new default) format that is
     provided by this patch.
  
     The same option will allow the user to remove this setting that
     (s)he had made previously.
  
 Data Dictionary changed
 -----------------------
  
 1.  The RAD/NUC MED DIVISION (file #79) has a new field, USER PREFERS 
 LONG DISPLAY (field #150).  
  
     This field will be used to store the internal number of the user who
 prefers the long display of procedures over the condensed (new default)
 display of procedures in their Radiology reports.  Only the first record
 in this file will be used to store the user numbers, thus the same
 preference for this user will be recognized regardless of the sign-on
 division.

  The install time for this patch is less than two minutes.  Since there
  are frequently used routines included, this patch should be installed
  when all Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
