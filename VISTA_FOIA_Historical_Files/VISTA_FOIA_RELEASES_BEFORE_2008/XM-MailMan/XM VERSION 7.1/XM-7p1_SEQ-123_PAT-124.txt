Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*124
  
 NOIS: TAM-0400-30289
 Test Site:  Tampa, FL
 The API MOVEMSG^XMXAPI should not require XMK (basket number) when
 XMZ (message IEN in MESSAGE file) is used to identify a message,
 but it does.  This patch corrects that.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*110.
