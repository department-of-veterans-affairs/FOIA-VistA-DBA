Description:
============

 **********************************************************************
 * NOTE:  The compliance date for this patch install is June 26, 2006.*
 * This release is to support compliance with VHA Directive 2006-014  *
 * "ADMISSION CRITERIA, SERVICE CODES, AND DISCHARGE CRITERIA FOR VA  *
 * NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU)"                                    *
 **********************************************************************
  
 Software modifications will be made to increase the number of Nursing
 Home Care Unit (NHCU) treating specialty codes from 4 to 11 for use by
 all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) NHCU facilities.  Currently, 
 there are 4 Patient Treatment File (PTF) codes that can be used to 
 identify the types of services any given patient in the NHCU can be
 assigned.  With this increase, nursing home services will be categorized
 initially into two general service categories: short stay services or 
 long stay services.  Within these 2 categories, 11 new treating
 specialties will be established.  The new codes will serve to foster a
 more precise understanding of the types of services offered in VA nursing
 homes and will afford VA nursing home providers the opportunity to make
 admission decisions based on a framework of services offered rather than
 demand alone.
  
 The driving force behind this request is to develop a system-wide
 standardized approach to admissions for the NHCUs, which has been
 identified in the Geriatric and Long Term Care strategic planning
 process.  The results will provide quality indicators for patients whose
 stay in Long Term Care facilities is less than 90 days, i.e. short stay
 patients.  Additionally, it will support the Medicare Prospective Payment
 functions, which use the short form Minimum Data Set (MDS) for patients
 who are in VA nursing homes less than 90 days.  The indicators are required
 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services but cannot be 
 generated at the present time.  Based on a recent Government 
 Accountability Office visit, short stays account for an estimated 60% of
 our VA NHCU population.  This table update, along with changes to the
 Accumed product will help support compliance with these requirements.
  
 Additional information is available with this patch.  Please see Post 
 Installation Section.

 This patch will also inactivate several Mental Health Codes that will be
 listed below.
  
 The following will be added to the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file and to the
 FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file.  The specialties listed below
 will have the following defined, unless otherwise noted.  ANY NEW OR OPEN 
 ADMISSIONS OR MOVEMENTS ON OR AFTER 7/1/2006 NEED TO USE NEW OR 
 RENAMED CODES.

 The following code will be inactivated as of 8/2/06. The extended 
 effective date will give sites time to transfer patients on
 ASIH status to the new treating specialty codes when they return.  
 Current admissions that are using code 80 must be transferred
 to the appropriate new treating specialty code. Please Note:  This 
 code will remain active for Ward Definition and the VWM Segment 345
 (AMIS).

 If these entries are used in the Facility Treating Specialty file (45.7), 
 the first entry will be renamed as stated above.   These entries need 
 to be reviewed for accuracy.  The sites are responsible for ensuring 
 the correct SERVICE is identified in the Facility Treating Specialty 
 file (45.7).  Any other entries (if there are more than one) will be
 listed in the patch installation.  Please review the installation for
 further action if needed.  
  
 Modifications have been made to display the print name of the treating
 specialty, if known.
  
 The post-initialization routine will create entries in the
 FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7) with the same NAME (#.01),  
 SPECIALTY (#1), and EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) field in EFFECTIVE DATE (#100)  
 multiple field) found in the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file. Entries can be 
 modified in the Treating Specialty Set-Up, [DG TREATING SETUP], option 
 found in the ADT System Definition menu.
  
 Sites will need to complete the setup of the new treating specialty 
 codes as follows.
  
 Use the Treating Specialty Set-Up, [DG TREATING SETUP], option to
 initialize the number of patients for the new treating specialty and  
 populate the SERVICE (#2), PROVIDER (#10) if appropriate,
 and ABBREVIATION (#99) fields. 
  
 Any entries in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file (#45.7) with a 
 SPECIALTY of 80-NHCU will be inactivated as of 8/2/2006.  Any open 
 admissions or movements prior to 7/1/2006 will still use code 80. ANY NEW 
 OR OPEN ADMISSIONS OR MOVEMENTS ON 7/1/2006 OR AFTER MUST USE THE NEW 
 OR RENAMED CODES.
  
 This patch adds new treating specialties required for NHCU patient 
 movements.  We recommend that your clinical applications coordinator(CAC) 
 review your auto dc rules for treating specialty transfers in CPRS when 
 installing this patch.  Depending upon on how your site has created auto 
 dc rules, changes to exclude these treating specialties should be 
 evaluated.  If your site decides to exclude these treating specialties 
 from the auto dc rules in CPRS, you will need to add them to the excluded 
 treating specialties in the treating specialty change auto dc event using 
 the option [OR DELAYED ORDERS EDITOR].  If you have questions about this
 process consult your local CAC or log a remedy ticket to CPRS.
  
 Routine DGPTAE02 modifies PTF EDIT CHECK to accept the new codes
 when closing and transmitting PTF records to Austin. 
  
 PTF transmission to Austin Automation Center (AAC)
 ==================================================
  
 1)  If station type is Community Nursing Home (42), then AAC will ONLY 
     accept treating specialty code: 
  
       44-NH LONG STAY MAINTENANCE CARE 
  
     Otherwise, it will reject the record if another code is sent or it is 
     blank.
  
 2)  If station type is VA Nursing Home (40), then AAC will ONLY accept 
     the following treating specialty codes:
  
       42 - NH LONG STAY DEMENTIA CARE
       43 - NH LONG STAY SKILLED NURSING
       44 - NH LONG STAY MAINTENANCE CARE
       45 - NH LONG STAY PSYCHIATRIC CARE

       66 - NH SHORT STAY RESTORATIVE
       67 - NH SHORT STAY MAINTENANCE
       68 - NH SHORT STAY PSYCHIATRIC CARE
       69 - NH SHORT STAY DEMENTIA CARE
       95 - NH SHORT STAY SKILLED NURSING
       81 - NH GEM NHCU
       96 - NH HOSPICE
       83 - RESPITE CARE (MEDICINE)
  
     Otherwise, it will reject the record if another code is sent or it is
     blank.
  
 3)  AAC will use the following rejection codes:
  
       - Rejection within the 501 Segment - Error Code 506 - Invalid Bed 
         Section Code 
       - Rejection within the 601 Segment - Error Code 602 - Invalid Bed 
         Section
       - Rejection within the 701 Segment - Error Code 706 - Invalid Bed

 3. Sequence of Actions Summary:
 Note:
 1. Steps 1-7 of the Process Action Sequence document can be done 
    after installing the patch and prior to the July 1st deadline.  When
    you do step 5 you will use the 7/1 date.  You will also want to
    provide the NH Director or designee with the Inpatient Roster for your
    NH wards a few days in advance so that he/she can determine which new
    treating specialty will be assigned to the patient on July 1st.  Please
    be sure to provide the completed list prior to July 1st to the 
    individuals who will be entering the patient's treating specialty
    transfer in the computer.
  
 2. Steps 8-9 are done on July 1st when the patient's treating speciality
    is actually transferred.
  
 3. Step 10 is monitored from July 1st through August 2nd to ensure 
    that all patients who were absent on July 1st have the new treating 
    specialty assigned upon returning from their absence.  A good report to
    use for this review is the Treating Specialty Inpatient Information
    [DGPM TS INPATIENT INFORMATION].  This report is a daily report that
    can be run and identifies the patient's assigned treating specialty.
