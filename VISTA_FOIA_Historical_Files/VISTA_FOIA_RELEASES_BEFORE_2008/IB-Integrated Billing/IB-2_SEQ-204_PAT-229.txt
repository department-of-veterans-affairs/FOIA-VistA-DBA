Subject: CSA PROCESSING AND DATE DISPLAY FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two problems:
 1)  The sites are complaining that the CSA (Claims Status Awaiting
     Resolution) report is taking an excessive amount of time to run.
 2)  The Contact Date overwrites the Call Ref. No. on the Patient
     Insurance Info View/Edit screen [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE].
    
 ASSOCIATED E3R(s):
 ==================
    
 N/A
    
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================
    
 1. FGH-0203-31133  CSA processing takes too long
 2. BAY-0403-32311  'Contact Date' displays > 4 Digit Year
    
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 1. FGH-0203-31133  CSA processing takes too long
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the Claims Status Awaiting Resolution option [IBCE 
    CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING], there is a long delay while the computer 
    searches for records to include on the report. This delay impacts 
    the sites ability to complete their billing reviews in a timely, 
    cost-effective manner.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The report program processes an index of unreviewed bills. This
    index contains many old entries which were of Information/Warning
    status.  New entries of this type are cleared by an auto-review
    function but the old entries from prior to the auto-review are still
    hanging around.  These additional, unnecessary entries in the index
    cause a slow down in processing. This patch will run a conversion
    program to auto-review the old entries, remove them from the
    'unreviewed' index and add them to the 'completed review' index.
    Once these are removed, the CSA report generation should be much 
    faster.
    
 2. BAY-0403-32311  'Contact Date' displays > 4 Digit Year
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When viewing a patient's insurance policy information using the VP
    [POLICY EDIT/VIEW] action on the Patient Insurance Management screen
    [Patient Insurance Info View/Edit], the Contact Date field sometimes
    appeared to have more than 4 digits in the year. The problem was
    that the Contact Date field was being written on the same line as the
    Call Ref. No. field (overwriting it). This meant that the call 
    reference number was not being displayed as it should have been and 
    in cases where the reference number was longer than 12 characters 
    (i.e. longer than the date display), the extra characters appeared 
    to be part of the year.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Contact Date was moved down one line to where it was originally
    intended to be. This allows the Call Ref. No. field to be seen and
    allows the date to be displayed without extraneous characters showing.
    
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
    
 1.  RE:  FGH-0203-31133  CSA processing takes too long
     A conversion routine, IB20P229, has been written to update the BILL 
     STATUS MESSAGE (#361) file. All messages with a REVIEW STATUS of 
     "NOT REVIEWED" that were received prior to 03/24/2003 (compliance 
     date for IB*2*197) will be processed using the following rules.
     If they have a MESSAGE SEVERITY of INFORMATION/WARNING, they will:
     a. be reset to a REVIEW STATUS [.09] of "REVIEW COMPLETE"
     b. have their FINAL REVIEW ACTION [.1] set to "FILED - NO ACTION"
     c. be flagged "YES" for AUTO FILED WITH NO REVIEW [.14]
     This action will also move the record from ^IBM(361,"AREV",0,IEN) to
     ^IBM(361,"AREV",2,IEN).
    
 2.  RE:  BAY-0403-32311  'Contact Date' displays > 4 Digit Year
     The routine IBCNSP0 is modified at line CONTACT+18 as follows:
    
     Before -
     +17     D SET(START+4,OFFSET,"    Call Ref. No.: "...
     +18     D SET(START+4,OFFSET,"     Contact Date: "...
                         ^
    
     After -
     +17     D SET(START+4,OFFSET,"    Call Ref. No.: "...
     +18     D SET(START+5,OFFSET,"     Contact Date: "...
                         ^

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
     
  This patch can be installed at any time, however at some larger
  sites the installation may take considerable time and consume
  system resources so an off-hours installation may be a better choice.
     
  Install time - Installation time depends on the number of entries at
  the ^IBM(361,"AREV",0) node level and, to some extent, on local 
  system response time.  Test site installations ranged from a low of
  2 minutes, 17 seconds (Dublin) to a high of 3 hours, 28 minutes
  (Central Plains).  Processing took an average of .022 seconds per
  entry in the "AREV",0 level.  
  Optionally, an approximate installation time can be computed by running
  the following code from the M prompt:
   
 S X="",C=0
 F  S X=$O(^IBM(361,"AREV",0,X)) Q:X=""  S C=C+1
 S X=C*.022,H=X\3600,M=(X#3600)\60,S=(X#3600)#60
 W !,"Estimated conversion time = "_H_" hr. "_M_" min. "_S_" sec."
   
  *** JOURNALING WARNING ***
  At larger sites, the conversion process will involve a large number of
  Sets and Kills.  You may wish to consider turning off journaling for
  global ^IBM during the patch installation.  At least be aware that the
  journal file will be affected by this conversion process.
   
  If installed during the normal workday it is recommended that
  several options, related to the area of change, be temporarily
  taken out of service (See installation step 5 below).
     
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in
      the routine summary.  (DSM for open VMS sites only)
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in
      your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
            Edits and Distribution ...  
            Utilities ...

             Unload a Distribution
    
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter IB*2.0*229):
    
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed. It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
    
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package IB*2.0*229.
    
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//', answer NO.
      b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
          Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer YES.
      c.  When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of
          Order':' Enter the following:       
          Claims Status Awaiting Resolution   [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING]
          Patient Insurance Info View/Edit    [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
      d.  When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
          Order': Enter the following: (press return) 
    
  6.  Optional - Include the routines distributed with this patch in the
      mapped routine set.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
    
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if you 
      wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
    
  7.  Optional - You may delete the pre-init routine IB20P229
      after installation has successfully completed.
