Subject: National Release of new Race and Ethnicity Computed Findings

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  General Information
  =================
  Patch 14 will allow Clinical Reminders to meet the new standard set by the 
  Office of Management and Budget for race and ethnicity data. 
 
  This patch contains a change to the existing VA-RACE computed findings, two 
  new computed findings, one new pre-initialization routine, and a change to 
  an existing routine used by computed findings.
 
  A new pre-initialization routine, PXRMP14I, will rename the old VA-RACE 
  computed finding name to VA-RACE PRE 2003. PXRMP14I will be deleted upon 
  completion of the install. The VA-RACE PRE 2003 computed finding will 
  only return the old race values prior to the Race standard going into 
  effect in 2003.  Note: The old race field in the Patient File will no 
  longer be updated with the new Race updates made by PIMS users.  No 
  conversion is being done by PIMS to move a patients old race values to new 
  race fields.  
 
  The two new computed findings are VA-RACE 2003 and VA-ETHNICITY. The 
  VA-RACE 2003 computed finding will find races that were entered into PIMS 
  using the new standard set.  Routine PXRMPDEM contains changes that allow 
  Clinical Reminders to evaluate the new Race and Ethnicity fields. 
 
  The two new computed findings will return multiple race or eligibility 
  values for a patient to be evaluated by Clinical Reminders. The values 
  returned from these computed findings will be a concatenated string of the 
  multiple entries found (i.e., for VA-RACE 2003: "BLACK, WHITE").  The 
  CONDITION statements for these new computed findings should use "contains", 
  ("["), boolean logic (i.e., for VA-RACE 2003 I V["BLACK"). 
 
  The new VA-RACE 2003 and VA-ETHNICITY findings will begin to have finding 
  results available after patches SD*5.3*254 and DG*5.3*415 are installed. 
 
  Any reminders with VA-RACE PRE 2003 (the old VA-RACE) as a finding type  
  will need VA-RACE 2003 added as a new finding type.  If the old VA-RACE was 
  looking for CONDITIONS for HISPANIC patients, the VA-RACE PRE 2003 should 
  be changed to use VA-ETHNICITY.
