 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1)  ISP-1004-N0563   Updates to POW Work Sheet
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE worksheet for PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION, to add
     three new presumptives.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA79PI which will deactivate the
         current PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION worksheet (file
         396.6, IEN 135), and activate the new PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL
         EXAMINATION worksheet (file 396.6, IEN 190).
     b)  Created routines DVBCWPA1 and DVBCWPA2 that contain the text for
         the PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWPA to access the text routines in b),
         and print the new PRISONER OF WAR PROTOCOL EXAMINATION worksheet.
         Also, changed the worksheet to include bullets and rearranged the
         presumptive POW disabilities so that they print alphabetically.
