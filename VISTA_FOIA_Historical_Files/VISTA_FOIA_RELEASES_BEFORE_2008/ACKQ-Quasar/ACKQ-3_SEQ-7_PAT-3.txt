Subject: QUASAR AUDIOMETRIC MODULE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will add a new file and new routines under the QUASAR
 namespace.  The file and associated routines will be required to run the
 Audiometric Exam module that was developed in conjunction with the 
 Remote Order Entry System (ROES) Version 3.0 at the VA Denver 
 Distribution Center.  This is a "stand-alone",optional application that
 can be used with or without ROES 3.0, however, it is recommended that 
 ROES 3.0 be installed concurrently with this patch.
  
 This application is a GUI interface and may only be run in a Windows
  environment. Please refer to the Installation Guide for detailed 
 instructions on setting up this application.
  
 This application includes three functions: (1) an enter/edit module 
 allowing clinicians to enter or edit audiometric data for a patient, 
 (2) a module to view the audiograms recorded, and (3) a module to 
 transmit audiometric data to the DDC to be viewed or used when
 placing a hearing aid order.
  
 The Audiometric Exam module (ACKQ*3.0*3) provides new functionality
 for ASPS, to simplify and enhance the entry, display and use of
 information obtained during the Audiometric exam of a patient.
 This module is comprised of two distinct user applications:
 the Audiogram Edit and the Audiogram Display.
  
 The Audiogram Edit is a Windows based software application
 that allows clinicians to enter, edit or view a patient's audiogram
 exam information from the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 Tools menu or from the end user's desktop.  Using this application, a
 new audiogram record can be entered, or an existing record can be
 edited. Once signed, the edited data can only be viewed.
  
 Completed and signed records are stored in a local QUASAR global.
 They are also transmitted from this application to the Denver
 Distribution Center (DDC) through the VistA MailMan system for
 inclusion with orders for hearing aids and repairs when ordered
 through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package.
  
 The Audiogram Display is a Windows based software
 application that allows clinicians to view a patient's audiogram
 from the CPRS Tools menu or from the desktop.  It can also be
 called from the Audiogram Edit application, if they exist in the
 same directory and folder. This display presents the clinical
 information in a standard format recognized within the hearing
 industry. 
  
 There are 2 GUI options:
  
 (1) [ACKQROES3E] Enter or edit the data into file 509850.9. When
      signed this transmits the data to the DDC for use with ROES3
      Custom Hearing Aid orders.
  
 (2) [ACKQROES3] View the audiogram generated from that data and
      print VA form 10-2364.

 Technical Description
 =====================
 1. New file introduced with this patch:
    AUDIOMETRIC EXAM - ^ACK(509850.9
 2. New options introduced with this patch:
      ACKQROES3 - Audiogram Display - This option displays the audiogram 
      stored in the Audiometric Exam Data file using new remote procedure 
      call: ACKQAUD1. See the Option file entries to see other existing XWB,
      XUS, and DDR RPCs accessed.
      ACKQROES3E - Audiogram Data Edit - This option allows the user to 
      enter new audiograms which are then stored in the Audiometric Exam 
      Data file. Uses new remote procedure calls: ACKQROES and ACKQAUD2.
      See Option file entries to see other existing XWB, XUS, and DDR RPCs
      accessed.
 3. New remote procedures introduced with this patch:
      ACKQAUD1  - This RPC gets the audiogram data for up to the last 
      2 entries in the Audiometric Exam Data file and returns it to the
      calling program in the array ACKQARR(). It is called from the 
      option ACKQROES3.
      Routines used: ACKQAG01,ACKQAG06 
      ACKQAUD2 - This RPC takes the IEN of the Audiometric Exam Data 
      file entry and the patient DFN and returns an array of data 
      values for the audiogram. It is called by the option ACKQROES3E.
      ACKQROES - This RPC is used to set up and send the audiometric      
      data to the DDC. It is called by the option ACKQROES3E.
      Routine used: ACKQAG02
      ACKQROES: This RPC transmits data to the DDC & returns msg#, DDC
      msg#, err# and error msg.
      Routines used: ACKQAG03,ACKQAG04,ACKQAG05

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
 This patch was created with Kernel V8 KIDS.
  
 Users do not need to be off the system while the this patch is
 being installed.  You may wish to install this patch during non-peak
 hours. Installation will take less than 10 minutes.
  
     1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
         Answer YES to the prompt 'Want to Continue with Load? YES//'.
         This will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
     2. There is no need to stop Taskman or the background filers.
        The routines included in this patch are all new, so there are no
        routines to unmap.
  
     3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
     4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following option (when
         prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ACKQ*3.0*3):
  
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow 
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
             Transport Global.
  
     5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
         ACKQ*3.0*3.
         a) Select INSTALL NAME: ACKQ*3.0*3 
  
         b) When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon
            Completion of Install?' YES// respond "NO"
  
         c) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
            install?' YES// respond "NO".
  
         d) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu

     6. Unzip the ACKQ3_P3.ZIP file containing the executables
        ACKQROES3.exe and ACKQROES3E.exe onto the network.  They must
        reside in the same directory in order for the practitioner to
        view the audiogram display(ACKQROES3) from the audiogram edit
        program(ACKQROES3E). [An alternative is to place the
        executables on each client computer, referencing it in the
        application path of the CPRS Tools menu.]
  
     7. Assign Broker options ACKQROES3 and ACKQROES3E to selected ASPS
        staff members.  This will provide access to the options and
        allow them to startup successfully when the user logs in.
  
     8. Add the ACKQROES3 and ACKQROES3E applications to the CPRS Tools
        menu [See the separate installation guide for further 
        instructions].
