 CPH-1003-41171     Data removed on MT screen
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The message that displays at the bottom of Screen 4, (PREVIOUS CALENDAR

 reflecting the wrong status and Income for IVM converted cases, but not

 Income and status for all Income Tests except IVM Converted tests and only
 the message "Source of Test is IVM" for IVM converted tests.
