============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*289 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
 
 LR*5.2*289 is a mandated installation of the estimated Glomerular Filtration
 Rate (eGFR) delta check routine. Site(s) can setup the two new laboratory
 tests, Creatinine (including eGFR) and eGFR, in either a new or an existing
 Serum Creatinine test. One of the new tests holds the input value (test 
 result) and the other test holds the calculated output value. Both tests need
 to be setup in the same panel, which can be in either a new panel or, an
 existing panel.

 Background
 
 Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem. Adverse outcomes of
 chronic kidney disease can be prevented through early detection and treatment.
 Earlier stages of chronic kidney disease can be detected through routine
 laboratory measurements.
 
 The USRDS provides reliable nationwide data regarding the incidence, 
 prevalence, treatment patterns, outcomes, and cost of kidney failure treated 
 by dialysis and transplantation, the most severe stage of chronic kidney 
 disease. This guideline provides a definition of chronic kidney disease as
 well as definitions and estimates of prevalence of earlier stages of kidney
 disease.
 
 Chronic kidney disease is defined according to the presence or absence of 
 kidney damage and level of kidney function-irrespective of the type of kidney 
 disease (diagnosis). Among individuals with chronic kidney disease, the stages
 are defined based on the level of kidney function. Identifying the presence
 and stage of chronic kidney disease in an individual is not a substitute for 
 accurate assessment of the cause of kidney disease, extent of kidney damage, 
 level of kidney function, comorbid conditions, complications of decreased 
 kidney function, or risks for loss of kidney function or cardiovascular
 disease in that patient. Defining stages of chronic kidney disease requires 
 "categorization" of continuous measures of kidney function, and the "cut-off 
 levels" between stages are inherently arbitrary. Nonetheless, staging of 
 chronic kidney disease will facilitate application of clinical practice 
 guidelines, clinical performance measures and quality improvement efforts to 
 the evaluation, and management of chronic kidney disease.
 
 -----------------------------
 Reasons for estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)
 
 In February 2002, the National Kidney Foundation recognized the Glomerular
 Filtration Rate as an indicator of renal function.  The eGFR is calculated
 rather than measured, and the Washington, DC Medical Center has developed a
 routine known as a delta check that performs the calculation.  The Washington
 delta check uses the serum creatinine result, age, and sex from the local
 VISTA Laboratory package. The new program will calculate the eGFR for African-
 Americans and others according to the accepted calculation.
 
 It is important to note that National Kidney Foundation's "Kidney Disease
 Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic
 Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification" has stages of
 kidney disease based on eGFR and also action plan as per Guidelines 1 & 2.
 These guidelines are published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases Vol.
 39, No 2, supplement 1, February 2002.
 
 Adverse outcomes of chronic kidney disease can often be prevented or delayed 
 through early detection and treatment. Earlier stages of chronic kidney 
 disease can be detected through routine laboratory measurements. 
 
   * The presence of chronic kidney disease should be established, based on 
     presence of kidney damage and level of kidney function (glomerular 
     filtration rate [GFR]), irrespective of diagnosis.
 
   * Among patients with chronic kidney disease, the stage of disease should 
     be assigned based on the level of kidney function, irrespective of 
     diagnosis, according to the K/DOQI CKD classification Table 10.

     Notes: Chronic kidney disease is defined as either kidney damage 
     or GFR <60 mL/min/1.73m^2 for >=3 months. Kidney damage is defined 
     as pathologic abnormalities or markers of damage, including 
     abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies.
 
 VHA is probably one of the few organizations nationwide that has the potential
 to report eGFR whenever serum creatinine is done.  This will help us identify
 patients with kidney disease early and take preventive action.  We will save
 about $55,000 per year per patient for preventing or delaying dialysis. This
 does not take into account the morbidity associated with dialysis that will
 be prevented.
 
 Raye-Anne Dorn, National Tumor Registry Coordinator, has submitted a New
 Service Request for the creation of a laboratory test, the estimated
 Glomerular Filtration Rate, eGFR.  Thakor G. Patel, MD, Chief of Renal
 Diseases at Veterans Administration Central Office, endorses the request. The
 endorser is seeking an alternative to the creatinine clearance test, a
 laboratory test that measures renal function and requires all urine collected
 over a 24-hour period.  The request cites the difficulty of collecting such a
 specimen, particularly from elderly patients.  Additionally, the Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) Renal Program Office has recommended a standard
 process throughout VHA for performing and reporting the eGFR. The request is
 to release this locally created delta check as Class 1 software.
 
 The four-variable MDRD Study equation is recommended.  Although it has
 short-comings, it has been more rigorously evaluated than the Cockcroft and
 Gault equation, and performs better in patients with kidney disease, gives
 results in units of ml/min/1.73 m^2, and does not require measurement of
 weight.  Performance can be improved by calibration of the VA lab results
 with the MDRD Study lab (Cleveland Clinic).  Is there a VA "central lab,"
 that other labs relate to?  If so, it should be possible to "calibrate" that
 lab to the MDRD Study lab.  (Of course, there is no Cockcroft Gault central
 lab, so calibration is an uncorrectable error with the use of the Cockcroft
 and Gault equation.)
 
 The view is that it is difficult to interpret GFR values above about 60
 ml/min/1.73 m^2, due to differences in creatinine calibration among labs, and
 uncertainty in the measurement of GFR in that range.  This is the reason
 that the NKF defined CKD Stage 3 as GFR <60, and that there are few
 differences in the action plan for CKD stages 1 and 2 (kidney damage and
 GFR either greater than or less than 90).  It is important to instruct
 practitioners about the limitations of GFR estimates above 60.
 
 Stages of chronic kidney disease (R, O). Among individuals with chronic kidney
 disease, the stage is defined by the level of GFR, with higher stages
 representing lower GFR levels.

 Table 12 illustrates the classification of individuals based on the presence
 or absence of markers of kidney disease and level of GFR, according to 
 definition and staging of chronic kidney disease proposed by this guideline.
 In addition, it includes columns for the presence or absence of high blood
 pressure, because of the complex relationship of high blood pressure and 
 chronic kidney disease.
 
 All individuals with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 months are classified as
 having chronic kidney disease, irrespective of the presence or absence of
 kidney damage. The rationale for including these individuals is that reduction
 in kidney function to this level or lower represents loss of half or more of
 the adult level of normal kidney function, which may be associated with a
 number of complications (Part 6).
 
 All individuals with kidney damage are classified as having chronic kidney
 disease, irrespective of the level of GFR. The rationale for including
 individuals with GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is that GFR may be sustained at normal
 or increased levels despite substantial kidney damage and that patients with
 kidney damage is at increased risk of the two major outcomes of chronic kidney
 disease: loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease
 (Part 7).

 A. Simplified Equation To Predict Glomerular Filtration Rate from Serum
 Creatinine, Andrew S. Levey,(1) Tom Greene,(2) John W. Kusek,(3) Gerald J.
 Beck,(2) MDRD Study Group. (1) Boston, MA, (2) Cleveland, OH, (3) Bethesda,
 MD.
 
 We recently developed and validated an equation to predict GFR from serum 
 creatinine (Pcr), which is more accurate than creatinine clearance measured
 from 24-hour urine samples or predicted from the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation
 (Levey AS, Ann Intern Med 1999; l30:877-884). GFR is expressed as ml/min/l.73
 m^2.  Required variables include Pcr (mg/dl), age (y), race (black vs.
 non-black), gender, serum urea nitrogen (SUN, mg/dl), and albumin (alb.g/dl).
 In clinical practice and in retrospective studies, measurements of SUN and 
 alb may not be available.  Below, we list the full MDRD Study prediction
 equation (6 variables), as well as alternative prediction equations including
 fewer variables derived from measurements in the same 1628 patients.
 
        GFR = 170 x Pcr-0.999 x age -0.176 x 1.180 (if black)
               x 0.762 (if female) x SUN-0.170 x alb+0.318
        GFR = 270 x Pcr-l.007 x age -0.180 x 1.178 (if black)
               x 0.755 (if female) x SUN-0.169
        GFR = 186 x Pcr-l.154 x age -0.203 x 1.212 (if black)
               x 0.742 (if female)
 
 The table below compares the performance of these equations and the CG
 equation.
 
                        R 2     median A        75th % A        90th % A

        5 variables     .899    11.6%           19.9%           29.4%
        4 variable      .892    12.1%           20.5%           29.7%
        CG              .842    13.8%           26.4%           40.5%
 
 A=absolute value of the median (50th), 75th and 90th percentiles of the
 distribution of the differences between measured GFR and predicted GFR or Ccr
 for each equation (includes bias correction for CG equation).  We conclude
 that simplified versions of the MDRD Study prediction equation provide more
 accurate estimates of GFR than measured or estimated creatinine clearance.
