 Patch Tracking #: 40985075

 Blood Bank Clearance: 9/28/2005
  
 Problem: HD0000000100250
 Under Cache', the Kernel Error Trap displays numeric subscripts in string 
 collating order, making it harder than necessary to view and interpret the 
 symbol table. The display of subscripted variables always in string order.
 Fix: Change the way the variables are saved under Cache.  DSM used 
 different code. Changed the way the saved variables are ordered thru so 
 numeric subscripts should display first.
  
 Added code to save the VMS Username and Proccessname under Cache.
