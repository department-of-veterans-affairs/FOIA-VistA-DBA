Subject: NOIS problems in TM and DH fixes.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 E3R #8206   On VAX DSM to have TelNet links HALT from ZUVXD and not wait
 for the next user.
 
 NOIS DAY-0596-40526  A syntax error at RES+1^%ZOSV1VXD
 
 NOIS SDC-0596-60064  Problem was that users couldn't use ScreenMan after
 doing 'Print a spool document' because the IO parameters didn't get reset.
 
 -- The '%Index of Routines' option doesn't call the new version.
 
 NOIS DAY-0496-41713  Submanager count always low. Site and John Beaufait
 did a great job of researching this problem.
 
 NOIS WBP-0596-21109, SDC-0496-60862  After patch XU*8*18 if the site has
 error screens setup in taskman, a task getting an error would not get
 its status updated.  This was especially true when the error happened
 setting up Network Mail tasks, Follow-up Mail would check on the status
 of the task and not start new ones believing that one was starting.
 Thanks to David Dahlstrand for noticing the link.
 
 NOIS PUG-0596-51586  The new OPEN^%ZISH call wouldn't work to write a 
 newversion of a file.  Problem was only with the VAX DSM version.
 
 FILEMAN TEAM Problems with $$FTG^%ZISH on VAX DSM and reading records
 greater than 255 char.  ZISHMSM had the same problem.
 
 NOIS DES-0795-41067  TaskMan on MSM system could see the SYSTEM SHUTDOWN
 flag and would set the X-ref of the Inhibit Logon's field to prevent users
 from login on.  If the shutdown was aborted the X-ref would keep user from
 login on but looking at the Volume Set file would show the Logon Inhibit
 field still set to NO, this was confusing to sites.  This has been fixed
 by adding a new item to the set of codes System Shutdown that is set and
 cleared by taskman.
 
 NOIS IHS-0696-N0286  Site found a call to a missing TAG in %ZISH, it was 
 part of some code that is undocumented and the call has been removed.
 
 NOIS DAY-0196-42100  Intermittent UNDEF in XQALDEV.  One entry point didn't
 have all the variables setup.
 
 NOIS HUN-0396-20414  At VAX DSM sites running taskman from DCL the log 
 files could exceed the VMS limit and bring Taskman to a stop.  The fix
 is to not record a log file.
 
 FORUM errors.  UNDEF Error at SETVAR^%ZIS1 when selecting a item from the
 Local Synonym list.
 
 BRX-0296-10688 Site needed to help identify devices to users.  Site wanted
 the display the Mnemonic. This is a multiple and would cause problems.
 Added code to display the Device Location like the FileMan lookup does.

 ========================================================================= 
 Installation:
 
   1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Backup a Transport Global
   5.  Stop TASKMAN.
       Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
       user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors in 
       %ZIS is acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*24'
   7.  VAX DSM Sites in the production account rename ZUVXD to ZU.
   
       MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
       other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
       NOTE: You will see the following message: TASKMAN is not running.
       You must run XUP to setup the environment then run the routine XPDCPU
       in the production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed, 
       once the installation starts.
              
       MSM Sites - Once the install starts, KIDS will pause 5 minutes to
       allow time for you to go to the other CPUs, and make them ready to
       receive the patched routines.
       'D ^XUP' to setup the environment, then 'D ^XPDCPU' to load them.
            
   8.  After installing this patch, you need to move several routines from 
       your productions account to the manager account:
 
       ZIS5
       ZIS6
       ZISC
       ZISHVXD
       ZISHMSM
       ZISUTL
       ZOSV1VXD
       ZTER
       ZTER1
       ZTM
       ZTM5
       ZTMDCL
       ZTMS 
       ZTMS0 
 
 
       and in the manager account rename
 
       Example: ZL ZISUTL ZS %ZISUTL
       
       ZIS5       to %ZIS5
       ZIS6       to %ZIS6
       ZISC       to %ZISC
       ZISHMSM    to %ZISH   (MSM only)
       ZISHVXD    to %ZISH   (VAX DSM only) 
       ZISUTL     to %ZISUTL
       ZOSV1VXD   to %ZOSV1  (VAX DSM only)
       ZTER       to %ZTER
       ZTER1      to %ZTER1
       ZTM        to %ZTM
       ZTM5       to %ZTM5
       ZTMDCL     to %ZTMDCL
       ZTMS       to %ZTMS
       ZTMS0      to %ZTMS0
      
 
   9.  MSM sites now move both the % and non-% new routines to the MGR
       uci of the other CPU's.       
   9.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
  10.  Restart Taskman and enable user's login.
