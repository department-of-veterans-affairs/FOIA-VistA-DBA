 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
  
 1) REN-0503-60534   Writing to the null device
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In previous versions of Cache, the null device was allowed to be 
    written to without the device being opened. With Cache 4.1.x the 
    device needs to be opened.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified all entry points of ^DVBHQD1 to open output device if that
    device was not open.
  
    Test: use option  HINQ MENU  Generate HINQ requests
                                 Individual HINQ request
                 
  
 2) MAC-0601-60408   <NOTOPEN>OK+25^DVBHQD1
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When processing the HINQ suspense file, an error occurred when 
    writing to an unopened output device.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The modifications of ^DVBHQD1 in 1) above, will open the output 
    device prior to using it.
  
    Test: use option  DVB HSUSP-PROCESSFILE  Process the HINQ Suspense 
          File.
