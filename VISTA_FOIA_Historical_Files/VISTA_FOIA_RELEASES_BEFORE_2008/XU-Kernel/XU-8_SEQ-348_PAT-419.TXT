 Patch Tracking #: 43496521
 Test Sites: HEARTLAND-WEST HCS, Salisbury VAMC, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK
 Blood Bank Clearance: 8/18/2006
  
 IT Service Request ID: 20060309        
 Request Date: 3/24/2006        
 Request Name: C&A Remediation for strong Verify Codes
  
  
 During the C&A review of VistA the current practice of leaving the VERIFY
 CODE blank until the user signed on the first time was found to not comply
 with VA DIRECTIVE 6504.  This patch will bring VistA into compliance.
  
 A strong Verify Code will need to be assigned when setting up a user, This
 Verify Code will be expired and will have to be changed the first time the
 user logs on.
  
 The Access Agreement letters come from the HELP FRAME file (#9.2), "Batch 
 user access document" [XUSER COMPUTER ACCOUNT]. This has been modified to 
 report the Verify Code for the "Grant Access by Profile" [XUSERBLK] option.  
 It is passed to the form in the variable XUU2. After the install the site 
 will need to check that the local edits are put back in.  If you use an 
 alternative HELP FRAME you will need to update it to report the Verify 
 Code. For more information, please refer to the "Security Forms" topic
 under the "Adding New Users" topic in the "Signon/Security: Systems
 Management" chapter in the Kernel Systems Manual located at:
 http://www.va.gov/vdl/Infrastructure.asp?appID=10.
  
 A new field has been added to the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3). The 
 field AUTO-GENERATE VERIFY CODES (#11.2) is used to automatically select a 
 strong verify code.  If you are editing your own record this is skipped.
 Use the "Enter/Edit Kernel Site Parameters" [XUSITEPARM] option to edit.
  
 8989.3,11.2   AUTO-GENERATE VERIFY CODES 3;3 SET
  
                                 'n' FOR No; 
                                 'y' FOR Yes; 
               LAST EDITED:      AUG 17, 2006 
               DESCRIPTION:      During the C&A review of VistA the current
                                 practice of leaving the VERIFY CODE blank 
                                 until the user signed on the first time 
                                 was found to not comply with VA DIRECTIVE
                                 6504. 
                                  
                                 This field will be used when someone other
                                 that the user goes to enter a verify code.
                                 The system will select a strong verify
                                 code and tell the operator what the new
                                 code is.
                                 
  
 Also in this patch is a change to allow the CBO to use the CAPRI broker to 
 connect to a site and then use a Telnet session to finish there work.
 This was patch XU*8*403 but was folded into this patch so it would
 not delay this patch.  This can only be tested by sites working with
 CAPRI and the CBO.
  
 During a code review a bug was found in the ZU routine if a second error
 occurred during an error trap.
