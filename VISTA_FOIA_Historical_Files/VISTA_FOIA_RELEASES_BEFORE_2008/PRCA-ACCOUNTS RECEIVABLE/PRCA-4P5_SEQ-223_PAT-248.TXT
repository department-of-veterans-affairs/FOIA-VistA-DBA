  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 In September 2004, patches, PRCA*4.5*201 and IB*2.0*233, implemented 
 the design requirements for a software development project where the 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established a new set of revenue 
 metrics for use in monitoring the performance of the VHA revenue cycle 
 at all VHA facilities.  The desired metrics are industry-standard 
 measures that are commonly used in other public and private health 
 care institutions.  An existing VHA centralized data warehouse is used 
 to calculate these metrics and provides results via a web-based 
 performance metric site.  This data warehouse is updated on a monthly 
 basis.  VHA's Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified the daily 
 collection of this data as a high priority to support the metrics 
 development process. CBO needs the daily collection of data to populate 
 the centralized data warehouse with billing and collections transactions 
 from each VHA facility. The calculated metrics would be viewable to 
 field and headquarters staff through an existing website.  An automated 
 daily VistA extract would provide more timely and accurate data to this 
 centralized data warehouse.
 
 A second series of patches (PRCA*4.5*228 & IB*2.0*301) expanding the 
 data collected were released in August 2005.  This patch expands the 
 data collection further to include data elements for the National 
 Provider Identifier.
  
 The activation of the use of the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as 
 required by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act 
 (HIPAA) provides Department of Veterans Affairs with the ability to 
 more accurately report billing information based on an individual or 
 an institutional provider.  The NPI does not have the constraints of 
 matching spelling and addresses to ensure that the individual or 
 organization is the same.  If the NPIs match, it is the same 
 individual/organization.
   
 This enhancement will not change the timing of the data collection nor 
 what data is collected and transmitted with the exception of the 
 inclusion of the NPI where needed.  An explanation of the outgoing
 extract segments and their associated changes are listed below.
  
 Four instances of NPI have been included in the CBO Data Extract:
 
  1) The NPI for the Default Division that will be located in the 
     tenth piece of the 3-399A node following the Default Division name, 
     if the Default Division piece is populated.
  2) The Non-VA Facility NPI that will be located in the thirty-third
     piece of the 3-339A node following the Non-VA Facility name, if 
     the Non-VA Facility piece is populated. 
  3) The VA Provider NPI that will be located in the seventh piece of 
     the 4-399B node following the VA Provider name, if the VA Provider 
     piece is populated.
  4) The NPI for the Division Where Care Rendered that will be located in 
     the eighteenth piece of the 5-530A node following the Division Where 
     Care Rendered name, if the Division Where Care Rendered piece is 
     populated.  
 
 If no NPI is on file for any of these entries, the NPI piece will be null 
 in the node.
