Subject: NEW ACTION LINK TO FLAG

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch concerns authorization to re-link Patient Record Flag (PRF)
 notes that have been improperly linked, and to link existing notes created
 before Phase II of PRF.  It does NOT affect linking of notes during NOTE
 CREATION.
  
 This patch sends out new USR action LINK TO FLAG for Patient Record Flags
 Phase II, which is used to assign the above authorization.
  
 I. DESCRIPTION:
 ===============
 In setting up, sites will need to write business rules for action LINK TO
 FLAG before users can link existing notes created before Phase II of PRF,
 or re-link Patient Record Flag (PRF) notes that have been improperly
 linked.  The rules will probably bear some resemblance to the rules for
 linking Consults: For Unsigned notes, authors should be permitted to
 re-link their own notes.  For signed notes, re-linking should be reserved
 for a small group of users familiar with both TIU and Patient Record
 Flags.
  
 Rules will need to be set for both PRF Document Classes: PATIENT RECORD 
 FLAG CAT I and PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT II.
  
 TIU provides a new action to link existing, unlinked PRF notes (those 
 created before the implementation of PRF II) to flag assignment actions.  
 This new action is performed using List Manager action LINK TO OTHER 
 APPLIC. (Former action LINK TO REQUEST now appears as action LINK TO OTHER
 APPLIC on menus wherever action LINK TO REQUEST appeared before.)
  
 The action is available either directly or under submenu action 'Link ' on
 the following menus:
  
 Text Integration Utilities (MRT) ... [TIU MAIN MENU MRT]
 Progress Notes/Discharge Summary [TIU] ... [TIU MAIN MENU CLINICIAN]
 Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) ... [TIU MAIN MENU MGR]
  
 The LINK TO OTHER APPLIC action may also be used to correct PRF notes
 mistakenly linked to an incorrect flag action.  It is this LINK TO OTHER 
 APPLIC action which requires authorization using USR action LINK TO FLAG.

  USR ACTION FILE [#8930.8]
  =========================
  New action LINK TO FLAG is exported with IEN 26.  An environment check 
  routine prevents it from being exported with any other IEN.  If the site 
  already has action LINK TO FLAG with IEN 26, it is overwritten.
  
  The Data Dictionary is NOT updated.
