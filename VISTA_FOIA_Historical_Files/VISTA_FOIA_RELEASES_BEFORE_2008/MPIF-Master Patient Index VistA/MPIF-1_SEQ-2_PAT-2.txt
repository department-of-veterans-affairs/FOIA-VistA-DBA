Subject: PROTOCOL UPDATE FOR HL*1.6*57 AND HL*1.6*54

Category: 
  - Other

Description: 
============

  Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0
  
  The HL7 package is issuing patch HL*1.6*57 to enhance messaging.  
  As a result of this patch, the fields 'Sending  Facilty Required' and
  'Receiving Facility Required' for the subscription type Protocols in the
  MPIF namespace are no longer required and they need to be set to NO.
  
  Regardless of whether HL*1.6*57 has been installed, this patch (MPIF*1*2)
  can be installed immediately. This patch can be installed either before
  or after installing HL*1.6*57.
  
  We will resend out the following Protocol file (#101) entries with fields
  SENDING FACILITY REQUIRED and RECEIVING FACILITY REQUIRED set to NO:
  
  MPIF A28 RESPONSE
  MPIF A29
  MPIF A30
  MPIF COMPR COMPARISON CLIENT
  MPIF CMOR RESPONSE
  MPIF CMOR RESULT CLIENT
  MPIF TEST
  
  HL*1.6*54 corrected the message type VTQ and changed it to the correct
  message type, VQQ.  Two of the MPIF protocols used the VTQ message type.
  If you installed CIRN and MPI v1.0 and then HL*1.6*54, the fields were
  automatically converted.  If HL*1.6*54 was installed prior to CIRN and 
  MPI v1.0, the Message Type Generated and Message Type Received fields 
  in Protocol file (#101) will be blank.  This patch will ensure that the
  correct entry, VQQ, is present.
  
  The two protocols affected by patch HL*1.6*54 are:
  
  MPIF TEST
  MPIF ICN-Q02 SERVER
  
  **Note:  There are no routines associated with this patch -- only
  protocols.
  
  TEST SITES:  All CIRN/MPI sites
