Description: 
============

  
 This patch installs new software and data dictionaries to print Patient
 Medication Information Sheets (PMIs). It will delete the previously used
 MEDICATION INSTRUCTION SHEETS file (#54.7) stored in the global PSPPI. The
 new files are stored in the PS global and the seven new file numbers
 range from ^PS(50.621 - ^PS(50.627. The source for the PMI data is First
 Data Bank. There are three data dictionary changes to the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68). Field 11 named PMIS defined as a pointer to a file, has been
 renamed GCNSEQNO. It is defined as a number between 0 and 999999999.
 Field 12 named PMIS PRODUCT LINK defined as a number, has been renamed
 PREVIOUS GCNSEQNO. It is defined as a number between 0 and 999999999.
 Field 13 named NDC LINK TO GCNSEQNO is a new field. It is defined as free
 text 1-12 characters in length. The option, Print a PMI Sheet
 [PSNPMIS PRINT] , is exported.
  
 New files to be Installed include:

 National Drug File (NDF), Outpatient Pharmacy (OP), Pharmacy Data Management
 (PDM), Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS), and Bar Code Medication
 Administration (BCMA) users should be off the system when this patch is
 installed. Installation takes less than ten minutes.  This patch should be
 installed during non-peak requirement hours.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
  
 The environment check routine for this patch checks that the installing
 person is a valid user with DUZ(0)="@", and that the patch has not been
 installed.
  
 The post-install routine will set file security at the field level for
 standard NDF files and also adds data to fields in the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68).
  
  1. Restore the globals from file NDF4P62.GBL using the appropriate
     Operating System utility.
  
  2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  3. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  4. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  5. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*62).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*62.
  
  7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
   
  9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
