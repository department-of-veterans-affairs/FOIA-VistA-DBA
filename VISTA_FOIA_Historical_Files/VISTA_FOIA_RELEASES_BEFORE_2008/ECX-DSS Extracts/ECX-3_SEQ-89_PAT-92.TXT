 Overview
 ========
 The Decision Support System (DSS) Support Office specifies yearly 
 enhancements to the current DSS VistA package to improve the collection of
 information needed for cost and workload management reporting. In order to
 accomplish this objective, additional data will be added to the current
 extracts, current definitions and collection of data will be modified, and
 the process will be streamlined by eliminating superfluous extracts.
  
 Nutrition Extract
 =================
 New extract, worksheets, menu options and files have been created and it
 allows Decision Support Systems (DSS) teams to extract data from the
 Nutrition Patient file (#115). The extract will only pull outpatient 
 data. Non-patient data will not be extracted.
  
  
 Add Nutrition Extract (NUT) As A Menu Option
 ============================================
 A new menu option entitled Nutrition Extract [ECX NUT] has been added to 
 the Package Extracts [ECXMENU] Menu, which is located on the Extract 
 Manager's Options [ECXMGR] Menu, it allows the DSS sites to run the new 
 NUTRITION EXTRACT. 
  
 NUTRITION EXTRACT file  
 ======================
 A new Nutrition Extract file (#727.832) has been created to store the
 nutrition extract records.
  
   A.) FILE NAME:------------- NUTRITION EXTRACT
                                                 
   B.) FILE NUMBER:----------- 727.832           
                             
   C.) NUM OF FLDS:----------- 58  
  
   D.) DATA GLOBAL:----------- ^ECX(727.832,
  
 DSS-NUT Mail Group 
 =======================
 A new mail group 'DSS-NUT' has been created for the purpose of 
 receiving messages related to the generation and transmission of the 
 NUTRITION EXTRACT.
  
 Nutrition and Food Service (N&FS) Configuration Set-up Required For The
 DSS EXTRACT LOG File (#727)
 ==========================================================================
 The configuration set-up required for entries to the DSS EXTRACT LOG file 
 (#727) has been created for the new NUTRITION EXTRACT. 
  
 The DSS EXTRACT LOG file (#727) contains data about the extracts from
 VistA packages. Each entry includes the date of the extract, the package
 for which the extract was run, the date range covered by the extract, and
 the number of records sent. Data is entered into this file by the extract
 routines at the time extracts are run or transmitted to Austin Automation
 Center (AAC). Data in this file may be viewed by appropriate options
 within the DSS package.
  
 N&FS Configuration Set-up Required For The DSS EXTRACT DEFINITIONS
 File (#727.1)
 =======================================================================
 The configuration set-up required for entries to the DSS EXTRACT 
 DEFINITIONS file (#727.1) has been created for the NUTRITION EXTRACT 
 entries.
  
 The DSS EXTRACT DEFINITIONS file (#727.1) provides a mechanism for sites
 to tailor the running of package extracts by defining the frequency
 (daily, weekly, or monthly) with which the extracts will run and the
 number of days in the past for which data will be extracted. The EXTRACT
 NAME field (#.01) and the FILE NUMBER field (#1) are national standard
 entries, exported with the file, and should not be edited locally.
  
 N&FS Configuration Set-up For The DSS EXTRACT File (#728)
 =============================================================
 The configuration set-up required for entries to the DSS EXTRACT file 
 (#728) has been completed for the NUTRITION EXTRACT entries. 
  
 This file contains various data extract information utilized by the DSS
 Extracts software. This data includes the last date an extract was run,
 the Austin queue receiving the extract data, and extract setup
 information.
  
 Add LAST DATE NUT Field To The  DSS EXTRACT File (#728) 
 =======================================================
 The DSS EXTRACT file (#728) has been modified to add a new field entitled 
 LAST DATE NUT. This field reflects the last date the NUTRITION 
 EXTRACT was generated. If the extract has already been generated, this 
 shall prevent the user from generating the NUT extract for the same 
 timeframe. This date is set by the extract routine and should not be 
 manipulated via FileMan. 
  
 Add NUT STATUS Field To The DSS EXTRACT File (#728) 
 ===================================================
 The DSS EXTRACT file (#728) has been modified to add a new field entitled 
 NUT STATUS. This field is used to inform the user that the NUT extract is
 presently running. The data type code value is R = Running.
  
 Add NUT As A Selection On The Feeder Keys Print Menu Option   
 ============================================================
 The Feeder Keys Print [ECXFEKEY] Menu option was modified to add NUT as a
 new selection. This allows the user to print the list of Feeder Keys for
 the NUTRITION EXTRACT.
  
 Example Of The Current Feeders Keys Print Menu Selection Screen:

 field (#25) entitled REQUESTING PROVIDER. This field is extracted from the
 PROVIDER field (#6.5) located in the ACCESSION file (#68) multiple. The
 value of this field is prefixed with a '2'.
  
 Important Note: The ACCESSION file (#68) is purged every 90 days so sites
 need to be made aware of this limitation and need to run their extract
 within the 90-day timeframe.
  
  
 REQUESTING PROVIDER PERSON CLASS FOR BLOOD BANK (LBB) EXTRACT File
 (#727.829)
