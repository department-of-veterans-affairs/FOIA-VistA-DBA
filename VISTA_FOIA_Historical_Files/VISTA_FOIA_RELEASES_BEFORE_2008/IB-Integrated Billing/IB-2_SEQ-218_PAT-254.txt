 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. ISD-1103-71657   IB*2.0*205 Caused Problem with DM Extract        
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Diagnostic Measures DM Reports did not transmit for the month of
 October for a majority of the sites, due to the Unbilled Amounts report
 remaining in a "REPORT QUEUED" status.  Because of this one report
 remaining in this status, none of the DM reports were transmitted. While 
 some sites were successful in transmitting, in researching this, it was
 noticed that the sites that were successful in transmitting all of their
 DM data for October, had not installed patch IB*2.0*205, which updated and
 overwrote IB DM EXTRACT REPORTS (#351.7) file.  The sites that installed
 IB*2.0*205 overwrote the new input statements for the Unbilled Amounts
 report that were sent out in patch IB*2.0*235.  Therefore, the unbilled
 report was not running as it should have.  Also, further researching this
 problem, it was noticed that the reason the Unbilled Amounts report
 remained in a "REPORT QUEUED" status was that the code was updating the
 previous months unbilled report and not the current month status. 
 Therefore, there were two critical problems causing this.  This patch will
 fix the transmission of the data for October, and also fixes the problem
 so that it will not happen in the future. 
  
 Another change that is included in this patch is that the data for
 the Unbilled Amounts report will no longer be transmitted with the
 DM reports, but will still be generated locally at each site.

 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the transmission of the DM reports for the future runs of
 the DM reports only.  IB DM EXTRACT REPORTS (#351. 7) file has been sent
 with this patch to update the input statements for the Unbilled Amounts
 report that accidentally got overwritten by patch IB*2.0*205.  Also,
 changes to the routine IBJDE were made to correct the status updates for
 the Unbilled Amounts report. We changed the code to fix the date ranges
 and then made it so the report is not extracted each month, but is marked
 as complete so when the rest of the DM reports are run on the first,
 UNBILLED REPORT will not go but it will also not hold up the rest of the
 reports.  The report will be marked as extract complete so the other 
 reports will go,  but no data will be sent. To transmit the DM reports for
 October, post install, IBY254PO sets the status for the unbilled
 report entry to completed and then runs the transmit code to send the data
 for OCT 2003.
  
  
 Post-init routine IBY254PO has been sent with this patch to set the
 October data to extract complete.  After the patch is installed
 successfully, you can delete the post-install routine IBY254PO.
