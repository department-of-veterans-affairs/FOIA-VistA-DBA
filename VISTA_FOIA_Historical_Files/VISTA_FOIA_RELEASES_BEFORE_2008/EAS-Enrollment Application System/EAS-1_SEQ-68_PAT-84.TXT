Subject: 10/10 PRINT PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  I. OVERVIEW
  
     This patch addresses two Remedy tickets that pertain to the 10-10EZ 
     print functionality when executed from the Electronic 10-10EZ
     Processing option [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING].
  
  II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
      The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service 
      Requests associated with this patch.
  
     1.  Associated Remedy Tickets:
         ------------------------- 
         HD0000000064810 LAH-0205-60086  EAS EZ 1010 Print Problem
         HD0000000147261 Problem with 1010EZ Print
  
      2. Associated New Service Request(s):
         ---------------------------------
         NONE 
   
  III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
       This patch corrects the following problem:
       The 10-10EZ does not print if the output is not queued.
  
       Problem: When using the option Electronic 10-10EZ Processing [EAS EZ
           1010EZ PROCESSING], if the user does not queue the output, the
           print device selected is tied up, the 10-10EZ form does not 
           print and control is never returned to the screen.  This 
           happens because the queuing logic is called regardless of
           whether or not queuing was selected. 
      Solution: Fix the logic to call the queuing code only if the user
           elects to queue the output.

   V. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
    * Users On the System: 
    
       This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
       loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
       reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
    
    * Software Installation Time:
    
       The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off 
       peak hours.
