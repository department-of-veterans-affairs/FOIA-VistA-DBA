Description:
============

 This is a maintenance patch for fixing bugs and providing minor 
 enhancements.
  
 NOIS: 
   BUT-0804-20544

 Sites are experiencing a crash in routine RAORD2 when using the 
 Detailed Request Display [RA ORDERDISPLAY] option.  The RADFN variable is
 getting set to a null piece of a VistA alert variable if the variable
 exists.  This option may once of had a relationship to VistA alerts but no
 longer does.  If the user goes from a VistA option that processes VistA
 alerts and does not clear up the alert variables then uses the Detailed 
 Request Display [RA ORDERDISPLAY] the crash will occur.  If the user tries
 this option with no VistA alert variables in the symbol table the error
 will not happen thus making this an intermittent problem.
  
  
 NOIS: 
   A NOIS has not been logged for this issue.  
  
 Note: This fix will only effect sites who are running Talkstaion.
  
 Within Talkstation, Radiology users could not direct Addendum report text 
 to specific Addendum report areas.   Talkstation Addendums were rejected 
 if only Addendum impression text was entered.  A fix has been developed 
 to allow users to enter either Addendum report text, Addendum report and 
 Addendum impression text or just Addendum impression text.   Please note 
 that the following text must precede the impression text within Addendum 
 section of Talkstaion 'Impression:'.
  
  
 NOIS: 
   A NOIS has not been logged for this issue.
  
 An error occurs when the user enters the pipe '|' character at the time
 a Radiology order is placed.
  
 The clinical history is moved over to the exam record when a user tries to
 exercise the Report Entry/Edit [RA RPTENTRY] option, the option errors
 because the variable DIWF was not defined correctly.
  
 Before patch 51 DIWF equaled: "WC75".
 After patch 51 DIWF equals: "|WC75".

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
 Since the Radiology HL7 mechanism is affected by this patch, you should
 install it at a time when Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system. The 
 installation will take less than one minute.
  
 1.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
   
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
   
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
   
  2.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RA*5.0*51):
      
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
  
 3.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     RA*5.0*51.
   
      a. When prompted:
         "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options? YES//",
         respond YES.  
      b. When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
         enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med options:
            RA*
      c. When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
         Order':", 
         enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
            RA*
  
 4. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using
    the KIDS 'Utilities...' option [XPD UTILITY] and 'Install File
    Print' [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch
    (RA*5.0*51).
   
 5.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
