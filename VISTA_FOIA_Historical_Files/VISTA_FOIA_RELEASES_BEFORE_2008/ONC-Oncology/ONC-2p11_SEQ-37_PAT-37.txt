 This patch implements NAACCR Eighth Edition Record Layout Version 10.1.
 
 In addition to the implementation of NAACCR V10.1 this patch includes 
 the following enhancements, modifications and problem resolutions:
 
  1) NOIS NYH-0503-10540 (Data Submission Error re: Annual Call for Data)
 
     The following NAACCR data items export a FIN (Facility Identification
     Number).
 
     Registry ID [40]
     Reporting Hospital [540]
     Institution Referred From [2410]
     Institution Referred To [2420]
     Last Follow-Up Hospital [2430]
     Following Registry [2440]
     Archive FIN [3100]
 
     There are currently 2 FIN coding systems:
 
     7-digit FINs = a constant 6 + a 6-digit facility-specific code in the
                    range 020009-953290 (assigned pre-2001)
 
     8-digit FINs = 10000000 or greater codes (assigned 2001+)
 
     Vista ONCOLOGY only supported the pre-2001 7-digit FIN coding system.
     Some Vista sites have been assigned the 8-digit code.  When the FIN 
     code for these sites was extracted, the constant "6" was being prefixed
     to the 8-digit code creating an invalid FIN value.
  
     To accommodate both FIN coding systems the following change has been
     made:
  
     The "6" prefix has been added to the stored pre-2001 FIN codes.  (e.g.
     stored code 211145 will now be stored as 6211145.)  This will make the
     prefixing of the "6" unnecessary when the FIN code is extracted for 
     export.
     
  2) NOIS POR-0803-50617 (No line error)
 
     If the registrar attempted to delete an ONCOLOGY PATIENT (160) record 
     via the [DP Delete Oncology Patient] option AND the patient in question 
     had RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS (165.5,52.2) data, the application would 
     abort with a "noline" error.
 
     This has been fixed.
 
  3) RETIRED FIELDS
     
     a) PAIN ASSESSMENT (165.5,154)
        This data item was published in FORDS but later withdrawn by the 
        COC.  The NAACCR UDSC approved the COC proposal to retire this data
        item.
 
     b) At the users' request the following fields have been retired.
 
        In the OCCUPATION (160,42) multiple:
          YEARS IN OCCUPATION     (160.042,1) 
          LAST DATE IN OCCUPATION (160.042,2)
 
        In the SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT (165.5,60) multiple:
          SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY  (165.51,35)
          NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED      (165.51,37)
          SURGICAL PROC/OTHER SITE     (165.51,36)
          RECON/RESTORE - DELAYED      (165.51,33)
          RECON/RESTORE - DELAYED DATE (165.51,34)
     
  4) STATUS (160,15)
 
     In a previous patch the STATUS code descriptions were changed from
     mixed-case to uppercase.  Due to this change, the survival options, 
     which are case sensitive, ceased to operate correctly.  This has been
     fixed.
 
  5) FACILITY (160.19)
 
     a) The following entry has been added to the FACILITY file:
 
        6340185 SACRAMENTO VA HCS
 
     b) The following FACILITY NAME has been changed for FACILITY 6432165:
 
        old name: MARION MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
        new name: HEARTLAND REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
 
  6) MALIGNANT MELANOMA OF THE CONJUNCTIVA
     PATHOLOGIC M (165.5,87)
 
     The registrars were unable to enter PATHOLOGIC M values for MALIGNANT
     MELANOMA OF THE CONJUNCTIVA cases.  This has been fixed.
 
  7) DATE OF NO TREATMENT (165.5,124)
 
     If a DATE OF NO TREATMENT was entered, the registrar was prohibited 
     from entering any of the FORDS treatment codes which recorded the reason
     the treatment was not administered.
 
     e.g. If the patient refused chemotherapy, the registrar was prohibited
     from entering a code 87 (Refused by pt) in the CHEMOTHERAPY (165.5,53.2)
     field.
  
     This has been fixed.
      
  8) NOIS WBP-0903-20057 (Undefined Variable when Entering Abstrac)
     [ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...]
       [MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts]
         [4 Incidence Report]
 
     The "Incidence Report" print template was using the discontinued
     field *GRADE ABBREVIATION (165.5,25).  It should use the field
     GRADE/DIFFERENTIATION (165.5,24).  This has been fixed.
 
  9) SPANISH ORIGIN (160,9)
 
     It was requested that the field SPANISH ORIGIN (160,9) be provided with
     a default value of 0 (Non-Spanish, non-Hispanic).  This has been done.
 
 10) NOIS MEM-1003-70488 (fix casefinding radiology option)
     [SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...]
       [RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search]
 
     The Radiology casefinding option [RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology
     Search] searches the PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE (70.03,13) field of the
     RAD/NUC MED PATIENT (70) file for suspicion of malignancy.  If no
     suspicion of malignancy is found the case is bypassed.
 
     Many of the facilities are now indicating suspicion for malignancy in 
     the SECONDARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE (70.14,.01) field as the "differential 
     diagnosis".
 
     For this reason we have expanded the radiology casefinding to include
     searches of the SECONDARY DIAGNOSTIC CODE multiple.
 
 11) INTESTINAL TRACT NOS     C26.0
     DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OVERLAP C26.8
     GASTROINTESTINAL NOS     C26.9
 
     TNM coding and staging are not available for the above sites.  All of 
     the staging fields for these sites will be stuffed with the appropriate 
     "Not applicable" value.
 
 12) SEER SUMMARY STAGE 2000       (165.5,35)
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #1 (165.5,34) 
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #2 (165.5,34.1)
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #3 (165.5,,34.2) 
 
     If SEER SUMMARY STAGE 2000 is not 7 (Distant metastasis/systemic 
     disease), the SITE OF DISTANT METASTASES #1-3 fields will be stuffed
     with 0 (None).
 
 13) STAGE GROUPING
     URINARY BLADDER (C67.)
 
     The clinical and pathological TNM combinations T2 N0 M0 and T3 N0 M0
     for Urinary Bladder were computing a STAGE GROUPING of 99.  This was
     incorrect.  They will now compute STAGE GROUPING as follows:
 
     II  (T2 N0 M0) 
     III (T3 N0 M0) 
 
 The following NOIS calls have been resolved by this patch:
  
 NOIS NYH-0503-10540 (Data Submission Error re: Annual Call for Data)
 NOIS POR-0803-50617 (No line error)
 NOIS WBP-0903-20057 (Undefined Variable when Entering Abstrac)
 NOIS MEM-1003-70488 (fix casefinding radiology option)
