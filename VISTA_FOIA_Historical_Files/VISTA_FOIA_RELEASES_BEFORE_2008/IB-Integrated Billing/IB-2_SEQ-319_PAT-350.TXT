Subject: UPDATE VALID GROUP NUMBER VALUES & ADD NEW ADJUSTMENT CODE TO AUTO BILL LIST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

   This patch modifies the IB software to allow double leading colons
  and hyphens as part of the group number and adds CO 94 to the list
  of adjustment codes that meet auto-generation criteria to
  automatically create a Medicare Remittance Advice (MRA) secondary
  claim.
   
   
 Associated Remedy ticket(s):
 ============================
  HD0000000116391     E-claims error (colons in group # field)
   
  HD0000000144372     Add adjustment code CO 94- Processed in excess of
                      charges - to list of codes that meet secondary
                      claim auto-generation criteria.
    
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Dublin, GA
 Eastern CO HCS
 Louisville, KY
   
    
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  1)  HD0000000116391     E-claims error (colons in group # field)
   
    
 Problem: 
 ========
  It is possible for a payer to have double leading hyphens (--) or
  colons (::) in their group number, but VistA strips the leading colons
  and doesn't allow hyphens so when the claims are transmitted they are
  rejected by the payer. 
     
   
 Resolution:
 ===========
  Modify the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file internal entry number 137
  so that double colons (::) are no longer stripped.  Modify the input
  transform for GROUP NUMBER (#.04) field in the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN FILE
  (#355.3) to allow leading double hyphens (--) as a valid entry.
     
   
   
  2)  HD0000000144372   Add adjustment code CO 94- Processed in excess of
                        charges - to list of codes that meet secondary
                        claim auto-generation criteria.
   
   
 Problem: 
 ========
   There has been an increase of adjustment code CO 94 showing
   up on all sites MRA work list.  Due to the large number of these
   adjustment codes that need to be processed manually, it was
   decided that this adjustment code should be added to the list of
   codes that automatically create an MRA secondary claim. 
      
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
   Add CO 94 to the list of adjustment codes that are  automatically
   processed.
