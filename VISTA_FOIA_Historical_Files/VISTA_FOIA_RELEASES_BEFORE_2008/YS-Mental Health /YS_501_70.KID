This patch addresses the following issues in the Mental Health software. 
"BLD",3834,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,3,0)
 1. Patients who take the BECK SCALE FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION (BSI) test on
"BLD",3834,1,4,0)
    the Mental Health Assistant are presented with questions that do not 
"BLD",3834,1,5,0)
    make sense when compared to their previous answers. For example, the 
"BLD",3834,1,6,0)
    patient says that he/she is not suicidal but the test asks him/her 
"BLD",3834,1,7,0)
    detailed questions about the last attempt and possible future attempts
"BLD",3834,1,8,0)
    at suicide.  The skip logic for the BSI was not included in MHA.
"BLD",3834,1,9,0)
    The skip logic for the BSI using the List Manager software worked
"BLD",3834,1,10,0)
    properly. This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10.
"BLD",3834,1,11,0)
    CLE-0303-41699
"BLD",3834,1,12,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,13,0)
 2. New scales have been added to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
"BLD",3834,1,14,0)
    Inventory-2 (MMPI2).  The new scales are the Restructured Clinical
"BLD",3834,1,15,0)
    (RC) Scales for the MMPI2.  The RC scales are based on recent factor
"BLD",3834,1,16,0)
    analyses of the existing Clinical Scales, and are intended to be used
"BLD",3834,1,17,0)
    as aids in the interpretation of the Clinical Scale profile.  The names
"BLD",3834,1,18,0)
    of the 9 RC scales are as follows (note that there is no RC5 scale):
"BLD",3834,1,19,0)
    RCd: Demoralization
"BLD",3834,1,20,0)
    RC1: Somatic Complaints
"BLD",3834,1,21,0)
    RC2: Low Positive Emotions
"BLD",3834,1,22,0)
    RC3: Cynicism
"BLD",3834,1,23,0)
    RC4: Antisocial Behavior
"BLD",3834,1,24,0)
    RC6: Ideas of Persecution
"BLD",3834,1,25,0)
    RC7: Dysfunctional Negative Emotions
"BLD",3834,1,26,0)
    RC8: Aberrant Experiences
"BLD",3834,1,27,0)
    RC9: Hypomanic Activation
"BLD",3834,1,28,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,29,0)
    Note:
"BLD",3834,1,30,0)
    The set of MMPI2 scales that are scored and the order in which they are 
"BLD",3834,1,31,0)
    presented has been changed to be consistent with the recommendations of 
"BLD",3834,1,32,0)
    the test authors and publisher. 
"BLD",3834,1,33,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,34,0)
    The PTSD-Schlenger scale is no longer scored.
"BLD",3834,1,35,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,36,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,37,0)
 3. Three new psychological tests have been added to the MH INSTRUMENT 
"BLD",3834,1,38,0)
    (#601) file.  The new depression measures include the 20-item version
"BLD",3834,1,39,0)
    Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), the Center 
"BLD",3834,1,40,0)
    For Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 5 Items (CESD5) and the 
"BLD",3834,1,41,0)
    Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).  The PHQ9 is based on 
"BLD",3834,1,42,0)
    the 9 DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode, and test results
"BLD",3834,1,43,0)
    include both the number of criteria met as well as indication of 
"BLD",3834,1,44,0)
    whether the criteria for MDE are met.  All can now be administered 
"BLD",3834,1,45,0)
    using the Mental Health Assistant.
"BLD",3834,1,46,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,47,0)
 4. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed (AUDC) has been
"BLD",3834,1,48,0)
    revised to meet the new Alcohol Screening Performance Measure issued by
"BLD",3834,1,49,0)
    the Office of Quality and Performance.
"BLD",3834,1,50,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,51,0)
 5. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed Revised (AUDCR)
"BLD",3834,1,52,0)
    has been made non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the 
"BLD",3834,1,53,0)
    MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).
"BLD",3834,1,54,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,55,0)
 6. An entry to the COPYRIGHT HOLDER file (#601.3) has been made for the new
"BLD",3834,1,56,0)
    psychological test PHQ9.
"BLD",3834,1,57,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,58,0)
 7. The instrument Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEOPI) in the MH
"BLD",3834,1,59,0)
    MULTIPLE SCORING file (#601.6), which allows the user to score
"BLD",3834,1,60,0)
    multiple instruments, has been edited to correctly return scale 
"BLD",3834,1,61,0)
    scores to be displayed on the Test Results in the Mental Health
"BLD",3834,1,62,0)
    Assistant (MHA).
"BLD",3834,1,63,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,64,0)
    Also corrected within the NEOPI is item #86 which read "When I'm under 
"BLD",3834,1,65,0)
    a great deal of stress, sometimes I fell like I'm going to pieces.".  
"BLD",3834,1,66,0)
    Item #86 now reads as "When I'm under a great deal of stress, sometimes
"BLD",3834,1,67,0)
    I feel like I'm going to pieces." 
"BLD",3834,1,68,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,69,0)
 
"BLD",3834,1,70,0)
 8. When running option List Test and Interviews [YSMLST] from programmer
"BLD",3834,1,71,0)
    prompt...%DSM-E-ENDOFILE, end of file encountered.  This error has been 
"BLD",3834,1,72,0)
    corrected.

 9. The instrument Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI3) in the 
"BLD",3834,1,77,0)
    MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) ITEM NUMBER field (#1) entry #41 which read
"BLD",3834,1,78,0)
    "I've done a number of stupid things on impulse that needed up causing 
"BLD",3834,1,79,0)
    me great trouble.". Item Number #41 now reads as "I've done a number of
"BLD",3834,1,80,0)

The MMPI-2 contains a number of items whose content may indicate the
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,2,0)
presence of psychological problems when endorsed in the deviant direction.
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,3,0)
These "critical items", developed for use in clinical settings, may provide
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,4,0)
an additional source of hypotheses about the respondent.  However, caution
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,5,0)
should be used in interpreting critical items since responses to single
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,6,0)
items are very unreliable and should not be treated as scores on full-length
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,7,0)
scales--for example, an individual could easily mismark or misunderstand
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,8,0)
a single item and not intend the answer given.  The content of the items and
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,9,0)
the possibility of misinterpretation make it important to keep the test
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,10,0)
results strictly confidential.  Special caution should be exercised when
"DATA",601,202,"G",1,1,11,0)
interpreting these items in nonclinical settings.

"DATA",601,215,7,2,0)
the 5-factor model of personality proposed by Costa and McCrae.
"DATA",601,215,8,0)

The test report consists of both raw and percentile scores for each of 5
"DATA",601,215,8,2,0)
domains and 30 facets of personality.  (There are 6 facets for each
"DATA",601,215,8,3,0)
domain.)  Separate norms are used to derive percentile scores for men and
"DATA",601,215,8,4,0)
women.

        The NEO inventory measures five broad domains, or dimensions, of  
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,2,0)
personality. The responses that you gave to the statements about your
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,3,0)
thoughts, feelings, and goals can be compared with those of other adults
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,4,0)
to give a description of you personality. 
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,5,0)
       For each of the five domains, descriptions are given below for
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,6,0)
different ranges of scores.  The descriptions that are checked provide
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,7,0)
descriptions of you, based on your responses to the inventory items. 
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,8,0)
       The NEO inventory measures differences among normal individuals.
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,9,0)
It is not a test of intelligence or ability, and it is not intended to
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,10,0)
diagnose problems of mental health or adjustment.  It does, however, give
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,11,0)
you some idea about what makes you unique in your ways of thinking,
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,12,0)
feeling, and interacting with others. 
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,13,0)
       This summary is intended to give you a general idea of how your
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,14,0)
personality might be described.  It is not a detailed report.  If you
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,15,0)
completed the inventory again, you might score somewhat differently.  For
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,16,0)
most individuals, however, personality traits tend to be very stable in
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,17,0)
adulthood.  Unless you experience major life changes or make deliberate
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,18,0)
efforts to change yourself, this summary should apply to you throughout
"DATA",601,215,"G",1,1,19,0)
your adult life.

This patch addresses the following issues in the Mental Health software. 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
 1. Patients who take the BECK SCALE FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION (BSI) test on
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
    the Mental Health Assistant are presented with questions that do not 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
    make sense when compared to their previous answers. For example, the 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
    patient says that he/she is not suicidal but the test asks him/her 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
    detailed questions about the last attempt and possible future attempts
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
    at suicide.  The skip logic for the BSI was not included in MHA.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
    The skip logic for the BSI using the List Manager software worked
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
    properly. This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
    CLE-0303-41699
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
 2. New scales have been added to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
    Inventory-2 (MMPI2).  The new scales are the Restructured Clinical
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
    (RC) Scales for the MMPI2.  The RC scales are based on recent factor
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
    analyses of the existing Clinical Scales, and are intended to be used
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
    as aids in the interpretation of the Clinical Scale profile.  The names
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
    of the 9 RC scales are as follows (note that there is no RC5 scale):
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
    RCd: Demoralization
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
    RC1: Somatic Complaints
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
    RC2: Low Positive Emotions
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
    RC3: Cynicism
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
    RC4: Antisocial Behavior
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
    RC6: Ideas of Persecution
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
    RC7: Dysfunctional Negative Emotions
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
    RC8: Aberrant Experiences
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
    RC9: Hypomanic Activation
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
    Note:
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
    The set of MMPI2 scales that are scored and the order in which they are 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
    presented has been changed to be consistent with the recommendations of 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
    the test authors and publisher. 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
    The PTSD-Schlenger scale is no longer scored.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
 3. Three new psychological tests have been added to the MH INSTRUMENT 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
    (#601) file.  The new depression measures include the 20-item version
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
    Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), the Center 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
    For Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 5 Items (CESD5) and the 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
    Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).  The PHQ9 is based on 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
    the 9 DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode, and test results
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
    include both the number of criteria met as well as indication of 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
    whether the criteria for MDE are met.  All can now be administered 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
    using the Mental Health Assistant.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
 4. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed (AUDC) has been
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
    revised to meet the new Alcohol Screening Performance Measure issued by
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
    the Office of Quality and Performance.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
 5. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed Revised (AUDCR)
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
    has been made non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,53,0)
    MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
 6. An entry to the COPYRIGHT HOLDER file (#601.3) has been made for the new
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
    psychological test PHQ9.
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
 7. The instrument Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEOPI) in the MH
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
    MULTIPLE SCORING file (#601.6), which allows the user to score
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
    multiple instruments, has been edited to correctly return scale 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
    scores to be displayed on the Test Results in the Mental Health
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,62,0)
    Assistant (MHA).
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
 
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,64,0)

"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,65,0)
    a great deal of stress, sometimes I fell like I'm going to pieces.".  
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,66,0)
    Item #86 now reads as "When I'm under a great deal of stress, sometimes
"PKG",24,22,1,"PAH",1,1,67,0)
    I feel like I'm going to pieces."
