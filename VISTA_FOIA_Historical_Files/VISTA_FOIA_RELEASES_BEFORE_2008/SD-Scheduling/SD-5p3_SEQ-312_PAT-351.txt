Description:
============

 BACKGROUND
  
 Office of Information Assurance, Office of Information, Veterans Health
 Administration, requested modifications to the VHA Information Systems and
 Technical Architecture (VistA) Patient Information Management System (PIMS)
 package that would allow for the use of multiple versions of the code sets
 employed in financial transactions. This work was completed in 2003 in the
 Code Set Versioning (CSV) project that was deployed in October of 2003.
 CSV included the Health Information Portability and Accessibility Act
 (HIPAA) stipulation that diagnosis and procedure codes used for billing
 purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the time service was
 provided. Four code sets, (ICD-9-CM, DRG, CPT, and HCPCS) for this project
 were modified as required under HIPAA legislation to be date-sensitive
 under the first phase of the project, i.e., CSV I.
  
 At the time that CSV I was developed, a request was made to defer
 applicable text versioning to the next iteration. This deferment of the
 short and long-text versions from the CSV project makes up the scope of
 this Code Text Descriptor (CTD) project. This follow-up project, Code Text
 Descriptors, intends to add the functionality of date-sensitive versioning
 for all applicable code text descriptors for the four code sets, effective
 with all textual changes occurring since October 1, 2002.
   
    
 This patch makes changes to AmbCare reports in support of the Code Text
 Descriptor project.  The following reports were modified to use date
 specific code text for the procedures and diagnoses included in their
 output:
  
    Ad Hoc Report                    [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT]
    Outpatient Diagnosis/Procedure   [SCRPW DX/PROCEDURE CODE SEARCH]
    Code Search

  1. Download the KIDS file CTD_MS_1_0.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
     directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the 
     appropriate directory on your system.
  
  2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
     enter: CTD_MS_1_0.KID
  
  3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
  4. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the appropriate patch
     designation - EC*2.0*63, PX*1.0*149, SD*5.3*351, DG*5.3*606 and
     IB*2.0*266):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package CTD MS 1.0.
