Description:
============

 This patch releases a new NATIONAL reminder and dialog required for the Iraq
 &Afghan Post-Deployment Reminder project.  It is placed into the REMINDER
 EXCHANGE file (#811.8).
 
      VA-IRAQ &AFGHAN POST-DEPLOY SCREEN
   
 This clinical reminder patch has been developed by the Office of Quality
 & Performance and the Office of Information (OI) System Design & Development
 (SDD) Health Data systems group.
 
  PRINT NAME: Iraq&Afghan Post-Deployment Screen
  REMINDER DESCRIPTION:   Patients who served in combat in either Iraq
  (Operation Iraqi Freedom) or in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom)
  should be screened for illnesses related to their service.  Screening for
  PTSD, depression, problem alcohol use, infectious diseases, and chronic
  symptoms should be part of the initial evaluation of these Veterans.  
   
  COHORT: veterans with separation date after 9/11/01.  This finding is
  part of the reminder term: IRAQ/AFGHAN PERIOD OF SERVICE and is determined
  by a computed finding.  
   
  RESOLUTION: entry of a health factor for NO IRAQ/AFGHAN SERVICE which is 
  found in the reminder term IRAQ/AFGHAN SERVICE NO will resolve the reminder.
  If the veteran served in Iraq or Afghanistan (IRAQ/AFGHAN SERVICE) then
  all the other items are required to resolve the reminder: 
    1) screen for PTSD, 
    2) screen for depression, 
    3) screen for alcohol use, 
    4) all 4 screening questions related to infectious diseases and other 
  symptoms.  
   
  An entry of IRAQ/AFGHAN SERVICE on the reminder dialog then requires all of
  the screening questions to be answered. 
  All of the individual elements of the screening tool are exported with 
  attached health factors and reminder terms. The national health factors 
  and reminder terms for the 2 question depression screen are used for the 
  depression screening.  The reminder dialog for alcohol screening allows 
  the use of the standard AUDIT-C tool from the Mental Health package or entry 
  of a refusal or entry of a health factor for no alcohol in the past year.
  The reminder term for ALCOHOL USE SCREEN contains the AUDIT-C and CAGE from 
  the Mental Health package, the health factor for no alcohol use in the past 
  year and the health factor for refusal. Additional health factors are
  included for PTSD screening and for the Infectious Diseases/Chronic
  symptoms screening.
  
  If your site does PTSD screening, then you will need to map your local health
  factors to the national PTSD reminder term (PTSD SCREEN) that is exported  
  with this reminder.  
   
  The Health Factors for all of these screens should be entered in the site
  parameters  as ones that cannot be added outside of a reminder dialog.
  Use the parameter ORWPCE EXCLUDE HEALTH FACTORS to exclude these from the
  electronic encounter forms.  Entry of these health factors should ONLY occur
  during reminder dialog use.
   
  REMINDER FREQUENCY: 99Y
  FINDING ITEM: IRAQ/AFGHAN SERVICE NO    USE IN RESOLUTION LOGIC: OR
  FINDING ITEM: IRAQ/AFGHAN PERIOD OF SERVICE
   USE IN PATIENT COHORT LOGIC: AND      EFFECTIVE DATE: SEP 11, 2001
 
 During the Alcohol Screen, if the patient answers yes to consuming alcohol 
 in the past year and the user clicks on that response in the dialog, a 
 button for completing the Audit-C will appear which consists of asking the 
 patient 3 Audit-C questions. If the user does NOT do the Audit-C at that 
 point,  the reminder will not be resolved since the reminder requires 
 completion of all of the elements.  The reminder will continue to show as 
 DUE on the cover sheet and the details will indicate that no alcohol screen 
 has been done. The reminder requires the entry of something that represents 
 an alcohol use screen in order to be satisfied. The reminder term for 
 alcohol use screen contains the HF for 'no alcohol use in the past year' 
 and the CAGE and the AUDIT-C.
  
 Functionality to require completion of AUDIT-C mandatory if the patient 
 answers 'Yes' to alcohol consumption in the past year will be included in 
 the release of CPRS GUIv24 in February 2004.
