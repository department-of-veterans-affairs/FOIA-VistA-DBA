Category: 
  - Routine

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch allows PXRM MENTAL HEALTH ACTIVE and PXRM GUI REMINDERS ACTIVE 
 parameters to be selected by service.  It also contains new remote
 procedure calls required by CPRS GUI V15, which will be released as 
 OR*3.0*85.
   
 Three new menu options are created for CPRS Configuration.
    
 A new option [PXRM NEW REMINDER PARAMETERS] is created in the [PXRM CPRS
 CONFIGURATION] menu. This allows the new cover sheet parameters released
 with CPRS GUI V15 (OR*.30*85) to be enabled for users, service, division or
 system. 
    
 A new option [PXRM DEFAULT LOCATION] is created in the [PXRM CPRS 
 CONFIGURATION] menu. This allows the default outside location used in 
 reminder dialogs to be specified at user, service, division or system 
 level.
    
 A new option [PXRM TEXT AT CURSOR] is created in the [PXRM CPRS 
 CONFIGURATION] menu. This allows the option to insert reminder text at 
 cursor to be enabled at user, service, division or system level.
  
 The patch includes three new RPCs for CPRS GUI V15 and also deletes 16 
 obsolete RPCs which are no longer required.
