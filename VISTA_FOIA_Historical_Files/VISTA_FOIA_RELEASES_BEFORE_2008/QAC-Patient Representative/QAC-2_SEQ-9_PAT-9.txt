Description: 
============

 This patch addresses problems from several E3Rs concerning the ability to
 call reports by division, and improving the VA Alerts for the Patient
 Representative package.  It also addresses one report related NOIS issue.
  
 Overview of E3Rs: 
 -----------------
 Sites that have been integrated can now specify a division when entering a
 Report of Contact.  This patch will allow many of the Patient
 Representative package reports to be sorted by division.  Addressed by
 E3Rs 11110, 9381.
  
 Report headers should show the date range selected for the report.
 Addressed by E3R 7248.
  
 The text that displays when a VA Alert is being processed has been changed
 to make it more more user friendly.  Addressed by E3R 9897.
  
 If a user deletes a VA Alert this fact will be reflected in the Resolution
 Comments along with any user responses.  Addressed by E3R 9204.
  
 A new report has been created, the Location Issue Totals [QAC
 LOCATION] report. It is similar to the Discipline Issue Totals [QAC
 DISCIPLINE TOTALS] and the Service/Discipline Issue Totals [QAC SERV/DISC
 ISSUE TOT] but sorts and displays the Issue Codes by location.  This
 option will be placed in the Statistical Reports Menu [QAC STATISTICAL
 RPTS].
  
  
 Overview of NOIS 
 ----------------
 Currently Service Level Patient Advocates cannot print a copy of a Report
 of Contact for security and confidentiality reasons.  The Report of
 Contact option is now being added to the User Menu [QAC USER] with one
 change.  If the user does not have the QAC EDIT key (normally given only
 to Medical Center level Patient Advocates) he/she can only use the option
 to print Reports of Contact he/she originally entered.  This was reported
 in NOIS PHO-0399-62866.

 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts.  Other DHCP users will not be
 affected.

 5. Select Installation Option:
 ---------------------------
    NOTE: The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME
    enter QAC*2.0*9)
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option creates a MailMan message
        that will backup all current routines on your system that would be
        replaced by the Packages in this Transport Global. Those components
        that are not routines must be backed up separately if they need to
        be preserved.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option lets you
        compare the components of a Transport Global, that is currently
        loaded in the XTMP global, to your current system.
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will verify
        checksums for the components of a Transport Global and will report
        any checksums that are incorrect.
  
 6. Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
    (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter QAC*2.0*9)
  
    **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch.
    a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
    b. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//' answer YES.
    c. When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':'
       Enter the following options:
  
                Patient Representative Manager Menu [QAC MAIN MENU]
                Reports Menu                        [QAC REPORT]
                Responses Due                       [QAC RESP DUE]
  
     d. When prompted 'Enter Protocols you wish to mark as "Out of Order':
        press <return>.
     e.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install', respond NO as long as the menu trees are re-built
        regularly. There is one new option and two additions to menus, but
        re-building the menu trees adds considerably to the time of the
        installation.
  
  
  
 7. ENABLE MENU OPTIONS
