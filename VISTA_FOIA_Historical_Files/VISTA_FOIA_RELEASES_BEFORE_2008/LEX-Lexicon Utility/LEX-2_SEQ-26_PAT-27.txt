Subject: API/PROTOCOL FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 
   This patch fixes the API responsible for the installation of new data
   and calling of post-installation protocols.  It fixes three problems 
   reported by NOIS calls.  It also fixes a cross-reference in the CHANGE
   LOG file #757.9 to reflect all files exported by each change.
 
   NOIS SUMMARY
   ============
 
   An Undefined Variable ^LEX(757.01,180726,0) at        NOIS OKL-1003-71528
   occurs at PICK+36^LEXAS2:2.  This error only               SBY-1003-31537 
   occurs if the user misspells the input.  Once              ALB-1003-51761
   the misspelling is detected, the LEXAS* routines
   (an internal spell checker) try to make sense
   of the user's input.  When doing this, it 
   encounters the broken pointer in the MAJOR 
   CONCEPT MAP file #757.
   
   The abbreviation "BPH" was mapped to the term         NOIS DAN-1003-41641
   "Hypertrophy (Benign) of Prostate" coded as 600.0          TUC-1003-61552
   (which was inactivated in patch 26).  The 
   abbreviation "BPH" has been re-assigned to 
   "Hypertrophy (Benign) of Prostate without 
   Urinary obstruction" (600.00) and "Hypertrophy
   (Benign) of Prostate with Urinary obstruction"
   (600.01).
  
   Fix the inactivation date of Sep 30, 2003 to          NOIS CPH-1003-41541
   Oct 1, 2003.  This was causing the STATCHK                 TAM-1003-31739
   API to return an inactive on Sep 30th, a date              ELP-1003-71852
   that should have been active.                              AMA-1003-72231
