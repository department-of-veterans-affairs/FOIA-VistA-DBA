 Description
 ===========
 The current version of the Health Level Seven (HL7) standard is 2.4.  
 Prior to this patch, the VistA HL7 package only supports versions 2.1, 
 2.2, 2.3, and 2.3.1.
  
   Note: The version numbers listed above are stored in the 
         HL7 Version file (#771.5).
  
 Every HL7 message is required to specify a version number in the MSH 
 segment. When applications use the VistA HL7 package for sending and
 receiving messages, the required version number in each message is checked
 against the supported versions that exist in the HL7 version file. If the
 HL7 version number found in the message does not exist in the HL7 Version
 file, the message is not processed.
  
 The VistA HL7 package will be upgraded to version 2.4 in two phases.  
 This phase one patch adds a new HL7 Version file entry of '2.4'. This
 will enable applications to send and receive messages through the VistA
 HL7 package with the '2.4' version number.  This patch does not update 
 other VistA HL7 package files holding entries that point to the HL7 
 Version file.  (E.g., the HL7 Message Type file (#771.2).)  These other 
 files will be updated by a second HL7 patch that will be released soon 
 after this patch HL*1.6*95 is released.
  
   Note:  After this patch HL*1.6*95 is released, applications may
          send messages holding version '2.4' in the MSH segment.
          However, they may only create messages holding version 2.3.1
          or earlier HL7 standard-based message types and event types.
          After the phase two patch is released, there will be no
          restrictions on the message types and event types usable in
          HL7 messages.
