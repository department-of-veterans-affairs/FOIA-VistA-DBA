Subject: MAKE ACTIVE A REQUIRED FIELD

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 It was possible to enter a new USR CLASS, via the USER CLASS DEFINITION
 option, and to leave the ACTIVE field null. If this was done then the newly
 entered class could not be seen from the option. The only way to make
 it visible was to edit the ACTIVE field using FileMan. This patch makes the
 ACTIVE field required so that it cannot be left null.
