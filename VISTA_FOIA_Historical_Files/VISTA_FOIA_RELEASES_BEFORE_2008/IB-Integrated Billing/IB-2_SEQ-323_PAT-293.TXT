Subject: Clarify Exemption date & fix IVM Backbilling bug

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues. The first is that site requested to change
 the heading "Last test date" to "Last RX Copayment Exemption date" in the
 DG Patient Inquiry option to match up to the data. The second issue is
 about a bug discovered in the IB's IVM backbilling functionality. If the
 veteran has an appointment in a billable clinic but also has a non billable
 stop code added, charges are not being generated.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD63266- MAC-0102-61448 Means test date on Patient Inquiry  bdj
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Patient Inquiry option [DG PATIENT INQUIRY] to view a
    patient, the heading "Last test date" can be very confusing to the
    users because the data is pulled from the patient's entry in the
    BILLING PATIENT (#354) file. It indicates the last updated date of the
    patient's Medication Copay Income Exemption but not the Means Test date.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBARXEU to change the heading "Last test date" to "Last
    Rx Copay Exemption date" in the Patient Inquiry option [DG PATIENT
    INQUIRY].
  
 2. HD64320- HWH-1004-41456  VISITS NOT GENERATING
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The code was found to be flawed at CARE+52 and CARE+53 in IBAMTV1.
    The logic of those two lines is stated as: "An encounter may also be
    excluded from billing in the additional two scenarios:
  
    1. The encounter is a disposition of a registration, and the patient had
       an appointment or add/edit stop on the same day.
  
    2. The encounter is an add/edit stop, and the patient had an appointment
       on the same day or the stop code (for the stop) was set up to be
       non-billable."
  
    How did the flawed code impact the process? "We checked a visit date 
    where the vet had a Derm appointment and a Lab Stop. The appointment  
    processed first and added an entry into ^TMP("IBAMTV". Then the Lab Stop
    was processed. Since CARE+53 failed to work properly, the Lab Stop was
    added to ^TMP("IBAMTV". Since that array is really only subscripted by 
    visit day, it overlaid the entry for the appointment for that day. Thus,
    the system tried to bill the Lab Stop and not the appointment. That stop
    code is set as Non-Billable in file #352.2 and thus that add/edit (as
    well as no encounter for that date) was not billed."
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBAMTV1 to implement the logic as follows: "An encounter
    may also be excluded from billing in the additional two scenarios:
  
    1. The encounter is a disposition of a registration, and the patient has
       a potentially billable appointment or add/edit stop on the same day.
  
    2. The encounter is an add/edit stop, and the patient has a potentially 
       billable appointment on the same day or the stop code (for the stop)
       was set up to be non-billable."
