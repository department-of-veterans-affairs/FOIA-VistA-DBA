Associated patches: (v)PSO*7*116   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*151'

Subject: INTERNET PRESCRIPTION REFILL CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1.  Currently, the HealtheVet system invokes the Outpatient Pharmacy
 V. 7.0 application to order a prescription refill and to check the status
 of the prescription refill process. The required input parameters include
 Integration Control Number (ICN), Social Security Number (SSN), and
 Prescription number (Rx #). This has caused a duplication in functionality
 and slow response time. To help speed up the process, a minor enhancement
 has been requested that will eliminate the use of ICN and remove the cross
 checking of SSN because the HealtheVet system itself verifies the accuracy
 of the SSN and supplies the patient number. This patch would provide this
 enhancement.
  
 Furthermore, besides the information that Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 
 currently returns to the HealtheVet system, it is also requested that two
 new fields be made available to them: Outpatient Pharmacy Division and
 Prescription Refill Status. This patch provides this information in the
 requested format.
  
 2. The HealtheVet team has requested an additional Outpatient Pharmacy
 V. 7.0 Application Program Interface (API) to provide Outpatient Pharmacy
 division information. The information requested is Inactive Status,
 Division Name, Area Code, Phone Number, and Refill Narrative Text. This
 patch makes the required information available.
  
 Note: Sites installing this patch will not notice any changes unless they
 are using the HealtheVet Internet Prescription Refill system.

  Installation should take no longer than 2 minutes.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.

        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
