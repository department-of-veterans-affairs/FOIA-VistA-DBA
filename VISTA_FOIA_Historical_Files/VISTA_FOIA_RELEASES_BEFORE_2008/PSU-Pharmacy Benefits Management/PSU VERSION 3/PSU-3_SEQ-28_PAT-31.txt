Subject: MISSING DIVISION NAME ON OUTPATIENT PHARMACY DATA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 MISSING DIVISION NAMES ON OUTPATIENT DATA WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENTRIES 
 IN THE OUTPATIENT SITE FILE (#59) WITH THE SAME SITE NUMBER. 
  
 ASSOCIATED E3R(s):
 ==================
 N/A
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================
 HIN-0903-40937
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Cleveland, OH
 Oklahoma City, OK
 Upstate New York HCS
         
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 Associated NOIS: NOIS HIN-0903-40937 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When there are multiple entries in OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) with the 
 same site number, the dictionary lookup fails and no division name prints 
 on the reports or mail messages for the sites that have the same 
 exact site number.
  
 Resolution:

 When doing a dictionary lookup on the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and it 
 fails, a lookup will be done on the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8)
 using the site number.

         components of the KIDS build.
