 NOIS OVERVIEW
 ==============
  
 1) IVM-1104-31949  HINQ no longer displaying POA information
    
                                 
    Problem:
    --------
  
    If there is only a Beneficiary Identification and Resource Locator System
    (BIRLS) record, the Power of Attorney (POA) value is set into a variable - 
    DVBPOA.  If there is a Compensation & Physical (C&P) record the POA value 
    is set into a piece of an array and totally ignored.  It is important for 
    the sites and for the Health Executive Council (VA/DoD) (HEC) users to be 
    shown the POA information regardless of where this information comes from.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    DVBPOA is set to "0"_the two characters in the response string.
    In the BIRLS Only segment POA is 3 characters starting with a "0",
    the "0" is discarded later.  Then, POA^DVBHQR2 is called, which
    puts the characters into display format (external values).   
    POA^DVBHQR2 was changed to handle two of the codes that are still
    being misinterpreted.
