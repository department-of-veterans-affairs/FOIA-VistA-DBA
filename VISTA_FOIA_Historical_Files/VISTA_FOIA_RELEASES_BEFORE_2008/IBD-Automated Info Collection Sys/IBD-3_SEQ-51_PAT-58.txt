Subject: CORRECT VITAMIN B12 INJECTION DOSAGE IN ENCOUNTER FORM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses the incorrect Vitamin B12 injection dosage shown on 
 the NATIONAL MEDICINE/ER VERSION 2 Encounter Forms, if imported. It does
 this by looping through the SELECTION file (#357.3), and the ENCOUNTER
 FORM BLOCK file (#357.1) and correcting all incorrect vitamin B12 dosages
 found.

 1. TOM-0704-42006     INCORRECT ENCOUNTER INJECTION DOSAGE
   
    Problem:
    -------
 The dosage for procedure J3420 is incorrect on the following Encounter 
 Form.
 NATIONAL MEDICINE/ER V2
 Description: National Primary Care Form April 2003
 Block: PROCEDURES (V2.1)
 This is what is listed on the block under the INJECTION header:
 [ ] J3420 Vitamin B12, per 1000mg
  
 It should be: 
 [ ] J3420 Vitamin B12, per 1000mcg
  
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
 The Vitamin B12 dosage is taken from the SELECTION file (#357.3), and 
 the ENCOUNTER FORM BLOCK file (#357.1). A Pre-Init routine attached to 
 this patch will process through these files and correct all occurrences 
 of the incorrect Vitamin B12 dosage from 1000mg to 1000mcg.
