  PERSON CLASS file patch.
  User documentation for this patch in PDF (Portable Document Format) is
  available on the Infrastructure Home Page at
  http://www.vista.med.va.gov/softserv/infrastr.uct/ under New
  Person file.  The PDF documentation may also be retrieved from the
  anonymous directories at Hines, Albany, and Salt Lake City with the 
  filename of 'XU_8_27.pdf'. 
   
  This patch adds a new file PERSON CLASS (8932.1) with data.  
    
  NOTE: The file PERSON CLASS is in global ^USC.  This will be a NEW global
  for most sites. Please be sure to place this global and add it to your
  translation tables.  This is a static file.
   
  The patch also:
  Adds a PERSON CLASS field to the NEW PERSON file.  This multiple includes
  the following fields:  NUMBER (.001),  PERSON CLASS (.01), EFFECTIVE DATE
  (2), EXPIRATION DATE (3).
   
  Adds the PERSON CLASS field to the following options: Edit an Existing
  User, Add a New User to the System, and Reactivate a User.
   
  Adds three  new menu options:
   
  PERSON CLASS EDIT ,(XU-PERSON CLASS EDIT), to the User Management menu.
  This option only allows entry of PERSON CLASS data.
   
  User PC Build Print, (XUSER PC BUILD) to print the entries of the
  individuals in the NEW PERSON file who hold the Provider key AND have a
  Verify Code.  It prints these fields:  NAME, PROVIDER CLASS (free text),
  and PROVIDER TYPE (set of codes).  The last two fields may contain data
  only at sites that have implemented Decision Support System (DSS).  This
  option is not attached to a menu but may be added to the secondary menu of
  any user who will be working on this project.
   
  User PC Build Edit, (XUSER PC BUILD EDIT), a straight DIE option to allow
  fast entry of PERSON CLASS data.  This option is not attached to a menu
  but may be added to the secondary menu of a user who will be performing
  data entry.
