Description: 
============

 Associated NOIS: None
 Associated E3Rs: None
  
 This patch makes the following enhancements:
  
 1) Transfers Military Sexual Trauma (MST) data (FILE #790, Field #.27) to
 the Registration package. After this patch is installed the Women's Health
 (WH) package will retrieve the patient's MST status from the Registration
 package for display and reporting purposes.
  
 The WH package will continue to store Civilian Sexual Trauma data, but in
 a new field called CST (FILE 790, Field #.28).
  
 a) A post-installation routine will check all the entries in the WV
 PATIENT file (#790) and convert the SEXUAL TRAUMA field value (#.27) into
 an MST and a CST value. The MST value will be transferred to the
 Registration package and the CST value will be moved to a new field (CST -
 #.28) in FILE 790. The SEXUAL TRAUMA field will then be deleted.
  
 If a patient's SEXUAL TRAUMA value equates to an MST status then an
 attempt is made to add an entry to the MST HISTORY file (#29.11) of the
 Registration package. If the patient's current FILE 29.11 MST status is
 the same as the WH equivalent MST status then no additional entry is made
 to FILE 29.11. A mail message is sent to the WH case managers listing
 those patients who were added to FILE 29.11 and those patients who could
 not be added to FILE 29.11. Patients who could not be added to FILE 29.11
 by the post-installation should be entered manually using the MST Status
 Add/Edit [DGMST ENTER NEW MST] option of the Registration package.
  
 After the post-installation every patient will have a CST value. If there
 is no value in the SEXUAL TRAUMA field then the patient will have
 "Unknown" as their CST value.
  
 b) Two data dictionary changes will be made to FILE 790.
  
 The SEXUAL TRAUMA field (#.27) will be deleted.
  
 A new field, CST (#.28) will be added to FILE 790. It will contain the
 Civilian Sexual Trauma status of the patient.
  
 c) In the Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA] option
 users will be able to enter a CST value which is stored in FILE 790. The
 patient's current MST status will be displayed in the header of the data
 entry screen.
  
 d) The following options display the MST and CST values:
    Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA]
    Patient Profile [WV PATIENT PROFILE]
    Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW PROCEDURE]
    Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE]
    Print a Procedure [WV PRINT A PROCEDURE]
    Add a Refusal of Treatment [WV REFUSED PROC-ADD]
    Edit a Refusal of Treatment [WV REFUSED PROC-EDIT]
    Add a New Notification [WV ADD A NEW NOTIFICATION]
    Edit a Notification [WV EDIT NOTIFICATION]
    Patient Profile Including Errors [WV PATIENT PROFILE W/ERRORS]
    Edit a Procedure Result [WV LAB EDIT PROCEDURE RESULT]
    List Sexual Trauma Data [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA LIST]
  
 e) The Sexual Trauma Summary Report (WH only) [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA SUMMARY]
 option is renamed Sexual Trauma Summary Report (i.e., '(WH only)' is
 removed). This option uses the MST status value from FILE 29.11 in the
 report counts. The option now prompts for one or all case managers. The
 report output no longer includes percentages. The counts in the report
 output are displayed in a different format. 
  
 f) The List Sexual Trauma Data [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA LIST] and Sexual Trauma
 Summary Report [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA SUMMARY] options are modified to allow
 the user to stop the report output if it has been tasked as a background
 task and TaskMan is in the midst of processing the job. 
  
 If the report output has begun to print when the user stops the task a
 message will appear on the output stating the report was stopped at the
 user's request. If the output has not begun to print when the user stops
 the background job no message is displayed.
  
 g) The List Sexual Trauma Data [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA LIST] option sorts the
 output differently. The output is sorted by case manager first, then MST
 status and finally patient name. The MST status order is:
   1) Yes, Screened reports MST 
   2) No, Screened does not report MST 
   3) Screened Declines to answer 
   4) Unknown, not screened   
  
 Non-veteran patients are displayed after the veterans.
  
 h) The Add Sexual Trauma Data to MST Module [WV ADD TO MST] option is
 removed from the File Maintenance Menu [WV MENU-FILE MAINTENANCE] menu. It
 is no longer needed. This option is deleted from the OPTION file (#19).
 The two routines, WVMST and WVMST1, that perform this option's
 functionality are deleted, too.
  
 i) The MST Status Add/Edit [DGMST ENTER NEW MST] option is removed from
 the Patient Management [WV MENU-PATIENT MANAGEMENT] menu. It is no longer
 needed. This option is not deleted from the OPTION file (#19).
  
 j) ScreenMan forms that are changed:
    WV NOTIF-FORM-1             FILE #790.4           
    WV NOTIF-FORM-2             FILE #790.4           
    WV PATIENT-FORM-1           FILE #790           
    WV PROC-FORM-1              FILE #790.1            
    WV PROC-FORM-2-COLP         FILE #790.1       
    WV REFUSED PROCEDURE-ENTRY  FILE #790.3
  
 k) OPTION file (#19) entries changed:
    WV SEXUAL TRAUMA LIST
    WV SEXUAL TRAUMA SUMMARY
  
 2) While testing the MST changes a problem was found in code that displays
 the date/time in the report header of several options. The entry point of
 the code is RUNDT^WVUTL1A. If the letter 'C' is passed as a parameter to
 this entry point, it should display the date/time in the center of the
 line of output. Before this patch, the date/time was not always centered
 in the report header when the letter 'C' was passed as a parameter. After
 this patch the date/time will appear centered in report header if the
 letter 'C' is passed as a parameter. This code is called from:
  
  Print Results/Diagnosis File [WV PRINT RES/DIAG FILE] 
  Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA]
  Procedure Statistics Report [WV PRINT PROCEDURE STATS]
  Sexual Trauma Summary Report [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA SUMMARY] *
  Browse Procedures [WV BROWSE PROCEDURES]
  Patient Profile [WV PATIENT PROFILE]
  Patient Profile Including Errors [WV PATIENT PROFILE W/ERRORS]
  Browse Procedures for Possible Duplicates [WV BROWSE PROCEDURES
                                             DUPLICATE] **
  Print a Procedure [WV PRINT A PROCEDURE]
  Snapshot of the Program Today [WV PRINT SNAPSHOT] ** 
  Retrieve/Print Earlier Snapshots [WV PRINT/RETRIEVE SNAPSHOT] **
  Automatically Load Patients [WV AUTOLOAD PATIENTS] **
  Display/Print Daily Log [WV LAB PRINT LOG] 
  
    * Indicates that this option was modified to pass 'C' as a parameter 
   ** Indicates that this option does not pass 'C' as a parameter (i.e.,
      the date/time should not be centered for this output).
