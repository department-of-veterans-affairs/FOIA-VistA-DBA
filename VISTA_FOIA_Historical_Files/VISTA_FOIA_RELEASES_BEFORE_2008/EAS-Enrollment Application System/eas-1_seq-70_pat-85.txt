Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC)  will install Patch 
 IVMB*2.0*925 (IY 2007 MT/GMT/RX THRESHOLDS) before January 1,2008.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2007-042 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2008. The patch is being released as an emergency patch (together with 
 DG*5.3*768 (2008 Means Test Thresholds) and IB*2.0*379 (2008 RX COPAY 
 THRESHOLDS) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to other
 released EAS patches.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2008
 provided in VHA DIRECTIVE 2007-042, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS
 TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2008 are distributed with this patch.  
 The updated values for GMT THRESHOLDS file #712.5 are used in the
 determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year, based 
 on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index.  The geographic based 
 income limits for FY 2007 can be found at:
 http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/pubs/GMTIncomeThresholds/
  
 Thirteen fields within the GMT THRESHOLDS file #712.5 and two fields 
 within the GMT MSA CODE file #712.6 will also be made un-editable by this 
 patch.  Depending on the environment at your site, additional routines 
 may be created during installation.  These are not core routines sent 
 with the patch but rather a by-product of the changes made to the data 
 dictionary in support of EAS*1.0*85.  If your environment 
 does not require such routines, none will be created.
  
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*85, is one of three VistA 2008 threshold patches.  It 
 addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds.  Patch DG*5.3*768 
 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual 
 Pension Rate.  Patch IB*2.0*379 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.
