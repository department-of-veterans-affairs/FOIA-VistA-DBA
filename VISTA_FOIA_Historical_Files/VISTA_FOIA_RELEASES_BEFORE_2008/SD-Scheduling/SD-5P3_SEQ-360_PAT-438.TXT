    Problem:
    --------
    This patch will place DSS Stop Code 690 (Telemedicine) on the exemption
    table for the Performance Monitor measures, as requested and approved
    by VA Central Office.  Stop Code 690 will be used by the Care
    Coordination group for the mental health telecommunications program.
    When a veteran receives mental health services via telecommunications
    there will be two encounters set up:
   
      Patient site - using secondary stop code 690.
      Provider site - using secondary stop code of either 692 or 693.  Both
                      are "count" clinics and will transmit workload to
                      Austin.
  
    The 690 clinic visit (patient site) will not have a progress note
    appended to it.  The 692 or 693 clinic visit (provider site) will have
    a progress note appended to it.  One of the performance monitor
    indicators is that all clinic visits have a progress note entered into
    CPRS.  Stop code 690 will be placed on the exemption table because it
    is known, and recognized, that it will not have a note appended to it.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Stop Code 690 will be added to the table of stop code exemptions
    in routine SCRPW303 at linetag EXCSTOP.
