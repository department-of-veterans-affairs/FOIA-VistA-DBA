Subject: Duplicate Messages and HLL Array Revised

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is to patch the released patch HL*1.6*117 for addressing two
 issues:
   1) This patch will compare the whole message header for duplicate
      messages in order to make the COTS interfaces, Optifill and
      Powerscribe to be working as usual even though both interfaces do
      not comply with HL7 Standard.  In the meantime, those two 
      COTS/Applications will fix their interfaces to comply with the
      HL7 Standard.
   2) Enhance code to honor that the HLL array is defined and used by the
      Processing Application when the variable, HLL("SET FOR APP ACK"), is
      defined by the Processing Application, such as Lab.
  
 No NOIS addressed.

  Installation Instructions (takes fewer than 10 minutes):
  =========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  VMS SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
        routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using the
        option listed below:
  
          Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
        VMS SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7-related OpenVMS TCPIP services 
        for this installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
        MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following 'Installation'
        menu options in the order shown below:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
  
        When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
        the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
        questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
        shown below.
  
          INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*125>
          Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols?  <NO>
  
    6.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
        VMS Sites:  If you previously disabled an HL7-related TCPIP OpenVMS
        service for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
    7.  VMS Sites:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
        map set, if necessary.
