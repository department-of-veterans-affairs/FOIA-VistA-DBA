Run Date: JUN 12, 1998                     Designation: HL*1.6*34

Subject: Msg ID, HLLP data blocks & LLP priority

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch solves the following problems:
    1.  IND-0797-40843: A corrupted message with message ID missing crashed
                        the HL7 incoming filer.
    2.  SLC-0897-50592: LLP priorities are no longer set by the routine.
                        The mailman LLP is fixed in patch 35.
    3.  STX-0897-70964: An unexpected message block sequence, issued by the
                        VIC machine, blew out the HL7 LLP process.
    4.  IND-0198-40985: system monitor/process priority.
    5.  Fixes the problem with undefined application name in fields (MSH;3)
                        and/or (MSH;5).
    6.  Messages arriving via the Mailman server option that are addressed
        to a protocol that does not have a logical link defined do not
        trigger an update to the system link monitor. This is likely to
        happen when messages are dynamically addressed using the API's
        described in the Patch 14 documentation.
    7.  Local application-to-application communication did not work if 
        'enhanced mode' commit acks were enabled.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
    2.  Stop all the incoming filers and LLPs.  
    3.  DSM/VMS SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines
        listed in the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be
        removed from the mapped set at this time.
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
    5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
     
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
           INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*34
                         =========
           Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
           and Protocols?'.
    6.  DSM/VMS Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
    7.  Restart the incoming filer(s) and LLPs, which have been stopped in
        step #2.
