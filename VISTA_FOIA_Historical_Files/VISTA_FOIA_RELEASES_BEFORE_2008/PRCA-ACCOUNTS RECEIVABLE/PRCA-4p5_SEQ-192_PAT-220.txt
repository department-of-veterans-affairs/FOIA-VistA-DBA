Description:
============

 The Additional Point Accounts/Revolving Fund project is required to
 support instructions from the Department of Treasury to establish point
 accounts for the Medical Care Collection Fund (MCCF) within the Financial
 Management System (FMS) to maintain accurate funds collection
 accountability. The Establishing Point Accounts project, released in
 October of 2003, provided enhancements to the VistA Accounts Receivable
 application to bring the Department of Veterans Affairs into compliance
 with Public Law 108-7 (FY 2003 Medical Care Appropriation).
  
 Point Account 528709 - Long Term Care, is a continuation of the original
 Establishing Point Accounts project, and Public Law 108-199 has provided
 additional direction for the VA Office of Finance regarding these funds.
  
 The functional objectives of the Additional Point Accounts/Revolving
 Fund project are as follows:
  
 -  Modification of Long Term Care routines to determine the general ledger
    number, bills for the Bad Debt Report, Cash Receipt (CR) documents,
    Write-Off documents and Standard Voucher documents.
 -  Modification of the display of the Bad Debt Report.
 -  Updating the routine table that associates the AR Category with 
    the fund.
 -  Creating an Application Program Interface (API) that returns the
    effective date for the new Long Term Care fund.
 -  Inactivation of the BD10 (Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)) Billing
    Document.
 -  Modification to the Category for Listing Bills Report to sore by 5287
    funds.
 -  Funds implemented in patch PRCA*4.5*203 with a point "." in the fund
    designation will have the point replaced by the number zero "0". These
    funds will have an effective date of September 28, 2004.
  
 They are as follows:
                     5287.1 will change to 528701
                     5287.3 will change to 528703
                     5287.4 will change to 528704
  
 This patch also implements the remaining Point Accounts for MCCF:
 The post-init routine, RCY220PT, will add these new categories to the file
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY (#430.2). The user may delete this routine
 after successful completion of the patch.
  
      Nursing Home - 528705 
      MCCF Parking Fees - 528706
      MCCF CWT - 528707
      MCCF Compensation and Pension - 528708
      Enhanced Use Lease Proceeds - 528710
  
 Bills using the above five new point accounts will be entered through the
 AR Billing Module as 1114 type bills. These bills will be transmitted to
 FMS on the BD09 Billing Document. Payments on these bills will be
 transmitted on the CR23 Cash Receipt and Write-offs to these bills will be
 transmitted on the WR04 Write-Off document.
  
  
 Eight new revenue source codes have been added to file to accommodate
 the new point accounts. The post-init routine, RCY220PT, will add the
 following new revenue source codes to file REVENUE SOURCE CODE (#347.3).
