Subject: DRUG BALANCE NOT UPDATED ON NAOU

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the issue where the drug balance is not updated when using
 menu option Receipt of Controlled Substance from Pharmacy [PSD REC GS].  
 Currently, it only updates the balance if there is not a patient defined in 
 the Drug Accountability Transaction file (#58.81) for the transaction.
 This check is also in menu options Receive Green Sheets from Another NAOU
 [PSD NURSE REC TRANSFER GS], Transfer Green Sheet and Drug to another
 NAOU [PSD NURSE TRANSFER GS] and Complete Green Sheet [PSD COMPLETE GS] for 
 statuses of RETURN TO STOCK and TURN IN FOR DESTRUCTION only.
