Description:
============

 This patch introduces the changes necessary to standardize the data in 
 supporting files of the Order Entry/Results Reporting package in 
 preparation for inclusion in the Health Data Repository (HDR).
   
 VHA Unique Identifiers (VUIDs) will be implemented in the ORDER STATUS 
 file (#100.01) and the NATURE OF ORDER file (#100.02); three new fields 
 and two cross references will be added to each file:
   - VUID (#99.99)
   - MASTER ENTRY FOR VUID (#99.98)
   - EFFECTIVE DATE/TIME (#99.991)
   - "AVUID" regular cross reference on VUID
   - "AMASTERVUID" index on VUID and MASTER ENTRY FOR VUID
 A post-init will populate the VUID values in every active entry or 
 inactivate non-standard ones.  In addition, every direct look-up into 
 these files will now use a new Kernel function to screen out inactive 
 items.
   
 A new option, "Print Parameters for Nature of Order" [ORCL NATURE], will 
 also be created with this patch, to allow continued edit access to the 
 print and display attributes within the NATURE OF ORDER file (#100.02); 
 because the file itself will now be locked down, all fields in this file 
 will be uneditable via regular FileMan options.  After installation of 
 this patch, this new option may be found on the "Print/Report Parameters" 
 [OR PARAM PRINTS] sub-menu of the "CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)" [OR 
 PARAM COORDINATOR MENU] option menu.  The Orders Domain has approved 
 editing of the following four fields in the NATURE OF ORDER file 
 (#100.02) via this option: 
   - PRINT CHART COPY (#.12) 
   - PRINT DAILY SUMMARY (#.13) 
   - PRINT WORK COPY (#.15) 
   - INCLUDE IN ACTIVE ORDERS (#.16)
  
 Following is an example of the new option, showing the four editable
 fields:
  
   Select Print/Report Parameters Option: NA  Print Parameters for Nature 
   of Order
  
   Select NATURE OF ORDER: AUTO       A
   PRINT CHART COPY: NO// 
   PRINT DAILY SUMMARY: NO// 
   PRINT WORK COPY: NO// 
   INCLUDE IN ACTIVE ORDERS: NO// 
  
   Select NATURE OF ORDER:
