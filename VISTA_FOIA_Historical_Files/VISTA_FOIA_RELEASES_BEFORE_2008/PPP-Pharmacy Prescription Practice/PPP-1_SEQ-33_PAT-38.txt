Subject: UPDATING NEW PATIENTS IN PPP BATCH JOB

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the problem of the PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF file
 (file 1020.2) not updating and the PPP NEW SSN file (file 1020.7) not
 purging. This patch will also update the file description for the data
 dictionary file, DIC(1020.2). An updated version of the technical
 manual for the package has been created as well.
  
 ********************************************************************
                                 NOTE: 
 The old version of the routine being changes used VOL/UCI/NAMESPACE 
 for to set the TMP global.  The new version sets the TMP global where
 it is running.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Pharmacy Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH]
 used to run a routine PPPBLD4, which added patients into the
 PPP Foreign Facility x-ref file (file 1020.2) if the patient had a visit to
 another facility on the MPD CD-rom disc. The routine also purged the entries
 from the PPP New SSN file (file 1020.7). With the release of patch 
 PPP*1.0*35, this routine was removed from the Pharmacy Prescription 
 Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH]. Therefore, the PPP Foreign 
 Facility x-ref file (file 1020.2)was not being updated, and the New SSN file
 (file 1020.7) was not being purged. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PPPBLD4 was modified and returned to the Pharmacy Prescription 
 Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH]. It was modified to not look at 
 the MPD server but to instead look at the Treating Facility List file 
 (file 391.91) via an integration agreement (#2990) with the Registration
 package. Now the PPP Foreign Facility x-ref file (file 1020.2) will be 
 updated daily, and the PPP New SSN file (file 1020.7) will be purged daily.
