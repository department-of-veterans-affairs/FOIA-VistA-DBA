 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 This patch, EAS*1*34, and associated patch, DG*5.3*518, introduce 
 enhancements to the VistA Enrollment Application System, needed to 
 support the Millennium Healthcare and Benefit Act, Public Law 106-117 
 Section 101.  This law defines the application of copayments for veterans 
 receiving Long Term Care (LTC) services.  These patches represent Phase 
 III of the Long Term Care Copayments project and will address the 
 following requirements:
  
 1. Allow the addition of a new LTC Copayment Test for the veteran at any 
 time, including multiple tests within the same year.
  
 2. Allow the entry of burial and funeral expenses for veterans with no 
 spouse or dependants.
  
 3. Allow the entry of expenses greater than total income on the input 
 screen for the LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC).
  
 4. Enable a user to delete a LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC) or edit the 
 date of a LTC Copayment Test if the user has been assigned the 
 appropriate security key (DG MTDELETE).
  
 5. Display the veteran's LTC copayment status and last test date on the 
 following Registration screens: Load/Edit, Patient Inquiry, and Register 
 a Patient.  If the test is more than a year old, the message "**NEW TEST 
 REQUIRED**" is also displayed.  If the veteran did not agree to pay the 
 copayments, a message is displayed that indicates that the veteran is 
 ineligible for LTC services.
  
 6. Prevent the entry of a LTC Copayment Test for a patient who is not a 
 veteran.
  
 7. Correct the display of the Declines to Provide Financial Information 
 field to include both the "YES" and "NO" responses when the LTC Copayment 
 Test is displayed. 
  
 8. Modify the Calculated LTC Copayments report to correctly display the 
 maximum copayment amounts for veterans who refuse to pay the copayment.
  
 9. Correct the determination of the LTC Copayment status when a veteran's 
 income is $0.  The LTC Copayment status will be Exempt.  This change will 
 address the NOIS call MAC-1102-61792.
  
 NOIS CALLS
 ==========
 This patch will resolve the following NOIS calls:
  
 MAC-1102-61792  LTC Copay charge incorrect
 CPH-1102-40590  LTC DOM charge may be incorrect (this is a duplicate of
                    MAC-1102-61792)

 key DG MTDELETE will have access to this option.
  
 The following option was modified:
  
 1. LTC Copayments Menu [EASEC LTC COPAY MENU] - The new option, Delete a 
 LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC), was added to this menu.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
 It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business 
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
   Installation Steps:
   ==================
   
   1. Download the KIDS file EAS_1_P34.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
      directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the
      appropriate directory on your system.
   
   2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION 
      menu, and enter:  EAS_1_P34.KID
   
   3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1*34 or DG*5.3*518
      are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this 
      time.
   
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select 
      the Installation menu.
   
   5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*34).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
         
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*34.
   
   7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is
      recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
      rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
   
   8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
   9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond NO.  
  
  10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
