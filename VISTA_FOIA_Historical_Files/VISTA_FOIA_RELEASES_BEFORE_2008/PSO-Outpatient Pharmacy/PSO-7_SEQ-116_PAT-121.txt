Subject: EXTERNAL INTERFACE DC'S/RX PATIENT STATUS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1) When an order entered through Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) V. 3.0 is finished in Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, fields can be
 edited during that finish process. One of those fields is the PATIENT
 STATUS field (#3) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). When this field is
 edited during the finish process, not only does that field get updated for
 that prescription, but the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55) also gets updated. Then when the next prescription is
 entered for that patient, the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55) is used as the default Patient Status, and that
 includes default and maximum values for various fields during the order
 entry process, whether the order is being entered through CPRS V. 3.0 or 
 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0. A request has been made to not update the
 PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) when the
 Patient Status is edited during the finish process if ADMINISTERED IN
 CLINIC was entered as the Pick Up for the order in CPRS V. 3.0.
  
 2) Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch PSO*7*111 introduced new functionality
 that enables the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package to receive New and
 Discontinue Pharmacy orders from an external system. When these orders are
 received, an immediate update is then sent from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0
 to CPRS V. 3.0. A problem has been reported on the Discontinue orders,
 when the update is sent from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to CPRS V. 3.0. In
 some cases, CPRS V. 3.0 will enter the current user into the DC'ed BY
 field (#62) in the ORDER file (#100). Since the only defined user on the
 system for this process could be the person who started the HL7 filers,
 this patch makes the change to send the requesting provider as the current
 user when the discontinue messages are sent to CPRS V. 3.0. This fix will
 only affect orders received from an external system using the interface
 introduced in patch PSO*7*111.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
  Because this patch modifies routines involved in the exchange of messages
  between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy, this patch should be installed when
  there are no Outpatient Pharmacy users on the system, and also when
  Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not being acted upon through CPRS. There
  are also three tasked jobs that generate message exchanges between
  CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy, and this patch should be installed at a
  time when these jobs are not running. These jobs are PSO AUTOCANCEL, PSO
  EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS, and ORMTIME RUN. Installation of this patch should 
  take no longer than 3 minutes.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*121)
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*121.
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
