Description:
============

 Background
 ----------
 The Health Administration Center (HAC) Decision Support System (DSS) 
 office, requested an enhancement to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VISTA) to implement an electronic means of 
 restricting medical centers from entering secondary DSS stop codes, also 
 known as DSS Identifiers, in the primary DSS stop code position.  Also to 
 prevent stations from putting stop codes in the secondary position that 
 should be primary only.
 
 This project is being implemented in 2 phases.  The first phase adds two 
 (2) new fields, restriction type and restriction date, to the CLINIC STOP 
 file #40.7 - done in patch SD*5.3*309. The next phase will be released in 
 a future patch and will perform validation on primary and secondary stop 
 codes when setting up a clinic in Scheduling.
 
 Patch ECX*3.0*53 is part of a combined build along with SD*5.3*309. 
 ECX*3.0*53 generates a report with clinics from the CLINICS AND STOP CODES 
 file #728.44 not conforming to the stop code requirements.  
  
 This patch is contained in the MULTIPLE BUILD DISTRIBUTION: SD_RSC_1_0.KID
   
    
 Technical
 ---------
 This patch ECX*3.0*53 implements the following functionality.
  o  Creates a new report,'DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report' that
     lists entries from the CLINICS AND STOP CODES File (#728.44) that
     have Primary Stop Codes and/or Secondary Stop Codes that are
     non-conforming to the stop code restriction types.
  o  Creates a new option, 'ECX CLN STOP REP', for the 'DSS Identifier 
     Non-Conforming Clinics Report'.
  o  Adds a new routine, ECXSCRP for the 'DSS Identifier Non-Conforming 
     Clinics Report'.
  o  Modifies menu option ECX SETUP CLINIC to add 'DSS Identifier 
     Non-Conforming Clinics Report' as a submenu.
  o  Produces a MailMan message of problem Clinics and their corresponding 
     stop code in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES File #728.44 after the 
     restriction is being applied.  This is done by the post install routine 
     ECX353PT.
