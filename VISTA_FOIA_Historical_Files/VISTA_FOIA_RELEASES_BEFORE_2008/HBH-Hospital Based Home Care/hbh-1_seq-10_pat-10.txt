    Description:
    ===========
  
    1)  Direct outpatient encounter information file reads changed to
        utilize AIT (Ambulatory Care Reporting Project Interface Toolkit)
        calls 
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCAPP1, HBHCAPPT, HBHCCAN, HBHCFILE,
        HBHCRP1A, HBHCRP1B
 
    The AIT functionality will access outpatient encounter data regardless
    of the option used to enter it originally.  This means that HBHC can now
    obtain the data even if it was entered using some other method besides
    Appointment Management [HBHC APPOINTMENT]  (e.g. Progress Notes entered
    using Text Integration Utility (TIU)).  (NOIS:  SFC-1297-60451, TIU 
    impact on HBHC software.)  The only known exceptions to this are neither 
    the Event Capture nor the TIU software creates an outpatient encounter
    entry if the patient is an inpatient.  Since HBHC wants to track
    inpatient workload, be aware that an appointment should be made for HBHC
    counting purposes.  (HBHC software obtains encounters that are flagged
    as inpatient, even though PCE (Patient Care Encounter) omits these from
    their workload.) 
 
    If other options besides Appointment Management are used for data entry, 
    then there may be instances where Appointment Management cannot 'see'
    the record that contains an error.  Data from other options should be
    visable utilizing the Appointment Management Report [SDAM RPT
    MANAGEMENT] option.  This report lists all encounters with action
    required.  Also remember that if other options are used for data entry,
    the same option must be used to resolve any errors found. 
 
    Utilizing AIT changes HBHC software from processing only HBHC clinic
    appointments for a parameter-controlled date range to processing thru
    all outpatient encounters (file 409.68) for a date range, checking to
    see if the encounter involves an HBHC clinic.  A new auto-queued file
    update option has been added to accommodate this additional processing  
    overhead.  This option performs the HBHC Visit (#632) file update   
    processing that also exists as part of the Build/Verify Transmission
    File [HBHCFILE] option.  The update processing includes both additions &
    cancellations for any encounters within the previous 7 days.  If an
    appointment is cancelled after being 'filed' in the HBHC Transmit file
    (#634), the processing will also remove the record from the Transmit
    file.  As has been true in the past, once a visit record is transmitted
    to Austin, there is no method in place for deletion/cancellation of that
    encounter at Austin. 
 
    The [HBHC AUTO-QUEUED FILE UPDATE] option should be scheduled to run
    daily at shortly after midnight.
 
    If any errors are found during the auto-queued visit file update,
    members of the HBH mail group will receive a mail message such as
    follows: 
 
    ====
    Subj: MAR 25,1998 HBHC File Update  [#10383533] 25 Mar 98 09:24  1 Line
    From: HBHC File Update Mail Group  in 'PATCH 10, HBHC' basket.   Page 1
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Please run Form Errors Report option for HBHC errors to correct.
    ====
 
 
    If no errors are found, no message is generated.  (Folks that receive
    the transmission confirmation messages from Austin are members of the
    HBH mail group.) 
 
    Note the From: HBHC File Update Mail Group in the message header. There
    is no such mail group.  This was simply a method to identify the message
    origination. 
 
    The Visit Error file (#634.2) is deleted & rebuilt as part of the
    scheduled auto-queued job.  When the Form Errors Report [HBHCRP1] is
    run, it will contain all existing visit file errors, including those
    from previous dates that have not been corrected.  Thus the user may
    receive 3 mail messages over a week-end (Saturday, Sunday, & Monday)
    stating errors were found, but the Form Errors Report generated will
    contain all visit errors to correct. 
 
    The Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE] option functionality has
    not changed.  The user should set the 'Number of Visit Days to Scan'
    system parameter to a large enough number to scan the entire date range 
    to be included in the transmit batch (normally 35-40, depending on what
    day of the month it is being run).  The user should set the parameter to
    365 one time after this patch is installed to gather any encounters that
    may not have been input via Appointment Management, or may have been 
    missed due to the parameter date range being too small sometime in the 
    past. 
 
    The 'Build' option has been changed to a queued job so as not to   
    disrupt the user for a potentially lengthy processing time.  The Task   
    Number is now displayed following the 'Transmission request has been 
    queued.' message.  The user who queued the option will receive a mail
    message when the job is complete.  The user will receive a 'Please run   
    Form Errors Report option for HBHC errors to correct.' message if any 
    errors are found.  The following is a sample of the message content if
    no errors are found: 
 
    ====
    Subj: MAR 25,1998 HBHC Build Transmit File  [#10386369] 25 Mar 98 12:55
    9 Lines
    From: HBHC Build Transmit File Mail Group  in 'PATCH 10, HBHC' basket.   
    Page 1
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    MAR 25,1998 HBHC Build Transmit File is complete with no errors found.
   
       Number of Visit Days to Scan system parameter:  365
   
       Date range:  SEP 30,1997  thru  MAR 25,1998
   
       Start time:  14:54:30   End time:  15:23:49   Elapsed minutes:  29
 
    *****   Reminder:  Please run Transmit File to Austin option.   *****
    ====
 
 
    Note the From: HBHC Build Transmit File Mail Group in the message   
    header.  Again there is no such mail group.  This was simply a method to
    identify the message origination. 
 
    The date range processed will only go back to 9/30/97 regardless of how
    large the Number of Visit Days to Scan parameter is set.  Date range
    will start with 10/1/97 during processing.  This is to ensure that only 
    fiscal year 1998 (FY98) data is processed.  (FY97 data did not include
    inpatient appointments, while FY98 does.) 
    
    The start time, end time, & elapsed minutes information allows the user
    some idea of how much time will be needed for processing future Austin
    transmissions. 
 
 
    2)  Visit error processing sequence was rearranged to better define
        actual error found by options:
          -  Auto-queue HBHC File Update [HBHC AUTO-QUEUED FILE UPDATE]
          -  Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE]
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCAPPT
 
 
    3)  Omit cancelled appointments in report options:
 
        QA Indicator Report  [HBHCRP13]
        Unique Patients by Date Range Summary Report  [HBHCRP20]
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP13, HBHCRP20
 
 
    4)  Display Task Number with 'Transmission request has been queued' 
        message in Transmit File to Austin [HBHCXMT] option, added check to 
        ensure Transmission not initiated while File Update in progress
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMT
 
 
    5)  PROMPT2+4^HBHCR15B null subscript error if Transmit Report Printer 
        (field 6) not defined in ^HBHC(631.9, System Parameter file, when
        using Print Transmit History Report [HBHCR15A] option, NOIS:
        BRX-0298-10318
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCR15B
 
    
    6)  Added 'Run Edit Form Errors Data option when corrections are 
        complete.' to 'use appointment management' reminder message in Form
        Errors Report [HBHCRP1] option.  This reminder message will be      
        printed only when visit errors exist.  Seconds were removed from    
        visit time for formatting purposes. 
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP1A, HBHCUTL3
 
 
    7)  'build' reminder message was removed from Edit Form Errors Data
        [HBHCUPD] option 
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCUPD
 
 
    8)  HBHCADDT variable obtains information from historic Evaluation
        Date field (#1, file 631) if Date (#17, file 631) is blank
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMD
 
 
    9)  Date range validated ensuring month of data to be procressed (which 
        established ending date of date range) follows beginning date
        created by Number of Visit Days to Scan system parameter in
        Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE] option 
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCFILE
 
 
   10)  New option:  Auto-queue HBHC File Update [HBHC AUTO-QUEUED FILE
        UPDATE].  This option should be scheduled to run daily at shortly
        after midnight.  This option runs against the outpatient encounter
        file (409.68) for the previous 7 days.
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCAPP1, HBHCAPPT routines, [HBHC
    AUTO-QUEUED FILE UPDATE] option added 
 
 
   11)  New field:  File Update in Progress Flag, field 7, file 631.9, used 
        to determine if file update processing is currently in progress by 
        options:
          -  Auto-queue HBHC File Update [HBHC AUTO-QUEUED FILE UPDATE]
          -  Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE]
          -  Form Errors Report [HBHCRP1] 
          -  Transmit File to Austin [HBHCXMT]
 
    Solution/Routine(s) changed:  field 7, file 631.9 added
