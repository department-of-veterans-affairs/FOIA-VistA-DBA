Subject: PROBLEM WITH POST INSTALL PSOPOST7

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 A problem was discovered with the post-install routine PSOPSOT7 that was 
 a part of PSO*7*115. A future patch will be released to correct the 
 affected orders. However, the list of orders is stored in ^XTMP and is
 queued to purge 30 days after the installation of PSO*7*115.
  
 In order to prevent this from being purged, please perform the following 
 at the programmer prompt:
  
 S $P(^XTMP("PSOPOST7",0),"^")=3030228
