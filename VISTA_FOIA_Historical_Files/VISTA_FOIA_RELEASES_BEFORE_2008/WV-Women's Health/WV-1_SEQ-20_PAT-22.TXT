Category:

Description:

 This patch corrects a problem caused by LEX*2*46 which inactivates
 mammogram CPT codes that were used by the Women's Health package.
 The 76090 CPT code for MAMMOGRAM DX UNILAT has been inactivated  
 and replaced by 77055. The CPT code 76091 for MAMMOGRAM DX BILAT
 was inactivated and replaced by 77056.  The CPT code 76092 for
 MAMMOGRAM SCREENING was inactivated and replaced by 77057.

 ===========
 LEX*2*46 inactivates some mammogram CPT codes that are used in the
 Women's Health Package file (#790.2).

 Create a post-init routine (WV22PST) which replaces (in file 790.2)
 the inactivated CPT codes for "MAMMOGRAM DX UNILAT","MAMMOGRAM DX
 BILAT", and "MAMMOGRAM SCREENING" with CPT codes that have been
 designated as replacements by the WH Program Office.
