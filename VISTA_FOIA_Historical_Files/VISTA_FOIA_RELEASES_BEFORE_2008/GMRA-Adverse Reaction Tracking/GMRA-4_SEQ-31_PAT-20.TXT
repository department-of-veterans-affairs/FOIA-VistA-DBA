 This patch updates the free text utility that was distributed in patch
 GMRA*4*17 so that it can now be used to identify ingredient file based and
 drug class file based allergies.
  
 The remedy tickets and Patient Safety Issues listed above describe
 situations where order checks did not fire due to the fact that only
 ingredient information was stored with the patient allergy.  While this
 patch will not stop a user from selecting from the ingredient file while
 entering an allergy, or reduce the risk associated with not receiving an
 order check, it does give the site a tool to identify and fix entries that
 are associated with an ingredient file entry.
  
 When reactants are selected from either the ingredient or drug class 
 files only that specific piece of information is stored with the 
 patient's allergy.  Order checking looks at both the ingredients and the 
 drug classes when determining if an order check should be fired.  As a 
 result, reactants should be selected from either the GMR ALLERGY file or 
 one of the National Drug files, to have the best chance of producing an
 order check.
  
 The order in which the files are searched when looking for reactants was 
 altered in patch GMRA*4*19 so that the ingredient and drug class files 
 were at the bottom.  This change helped promote selection from files that 
 include both ingredients and drug classes as part of the definition of 
 the reactant.  The ingredient and drug class files are still available to 
 choose from as there are times when selection from one of these files is 
 the best choice.
  
 In an effort to identify and update entries related to ingredient or drug 
 class file entries, the free text utility was updated to create and 
 maintain a list of free text, ingredient, and drug class allergies.  The 
 same options that were available for updating free text allergies will be 
 available for ingredient and drug class based entries.
  
 In addition to the update to the free text utility, which has been 
 renamed to the 'Allergy clean up utility', the bulletin that is sent when 
 a user cannot find a matching term has been updated to include the name
 of the reactant in the message.  This makes the message consistent with
 what the user sees when requesting the addition of a new term.
  
 The progress note that is sent when an allergy has been marked as entered 
 in error has been updated to clarify that the reactant may have been 
 entered in error or may have been found to no longer be an allergy or 
 adverse reaction for the patient.
  
 This patch also includes a post-installation routine that will review the 
 site's "top 10" sign/symptom list to make sure it only has 10 entries.  
 In a previously released patch, additional sign/symptoms may have been 
 added at positions 11 or higher.  The site is unable to delete or edit 
 these entries and the user never sees these entries as possible choices 
 when adding signs/symptoms.  However, when NTRT updates are sent out, it 
 is possible to get an email message telling you that an entry on the top 
 10 list is now inactive and that you must update the entry.  As stated 
 above, you have no way to do that and entries above number 10 shouldn't 
 be part of the definition.  This post-install will remove any entries 
 numbered 11 or higher.  The post-install also identifies any allergies 
 with an invalid pointer in the GMR ALLERGY field of file 120.8.  If 
 invalid data is found the entry is converted to a "free text" entry and 
 an email message with information related to that allergy is sent to the 
 installer after the post-install finishes. The allergy clean up utility
 can then be used to fix the entry.

 INSTALLATION
 ============
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users entering allergy information during the 
 installation process.  This patch should take less than 2 minutes to 
 install, but could be longer depending on whether you choose to rebuild 
 menu trees as part of the installation.
  
 **NOTE: Please be aware that test accounts are not standardized.  As a 
 result, when searching for a term the list produced in the test account 
 may not be the same as the list produced in the production account.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*20):

         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRA*4.0*20.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? YES//' Answer yes if you want the rebuild to occur as part 
     of the installation.  If you prefer to do it at a different time,
