 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000063744   Unable to inactivate stop code on wait list
  
     Problem:
     --------
     A user is allowed to enter a patient onto the wait list for a 
     service/specialty stop code that has been inactivated.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDWLE2, which uses Fileman API DIC for the lookup, will be
     modified to properly screen out inactivated stop codes.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000064233  Desired date of apt is wrong
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Menu option Enter/Edit Wait List, when entering the Desired Date
     of Appointment, the field in the SD Wait List file (409.3) is
     getting set to a -1.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     This problem occurs periodically because the Fileman variable %DT(0) 
     is still defined in the user's partition when Fileman API ^%DT is called.
     The logic in this case is only using this API in order to echo back the 
     user's input at the Desired Date of Appointment prompt, which uses the 
     Fileman Reader (API ^DIR).  The logic will be changed to use Fileman API
     ^%DT exclusively, resetting the input variables as necessary and 
     explicitly killing them when done.
  
  
 3.  HD0000000063702  2 problems with wait list
  
     Problem:
     --------
     1)  Users have the ability to enter past dates for the Desired Date
     of Appointment; and 2)  When entering just the month and day for
     the Desired Date of Appointment, the software does not always
     default to the correct year.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The current logic uses the Fileman Reader (API ^DIR), which will be
     removed and replaced with Fileman API ^%DT and set up so that users
     will only be able to select the current date or future dates and
     when entering just the month and day, the software will default
     to the correct year.
