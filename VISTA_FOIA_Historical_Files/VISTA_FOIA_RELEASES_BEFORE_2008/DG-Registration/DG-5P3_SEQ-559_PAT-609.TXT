 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HD63905 - STC-0404-42164  PTF Problem with Rendering Provider
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Attempting to select an inactive Provider in the CPT Capture action under
 PTF Menu - LOAD/EDIT PTF DATA the selection process will not allow any
 Provider with an inactive date since the check is made against data entry
 date and should be checked against the CPT Procedure Date.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Modify Data Dictionary entries under CPT RECORD DATE/TIME for
 Input Transform and Screening to allow entry of Provider as long as it
 falls before the Provider Inactive date. The following Data Dictionary
 entries have been modified:
               45.06,.02  REFERRING OR ORDERING PROVIDER
               45.06,.03  RENDERING PROVIDER
