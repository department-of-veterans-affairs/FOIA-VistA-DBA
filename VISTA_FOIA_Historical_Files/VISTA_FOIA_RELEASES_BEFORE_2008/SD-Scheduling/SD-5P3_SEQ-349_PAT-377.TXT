Subject: SORT ROUTING SLIPS BY PHYSICAL LOCATION.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem associated with the Scheduling 5.3 package.
 Users using the option ROUTING SLIPS (SDROUT) have requested that routing
 slips be sorted and printed by PHYSICAL LOCATION (Field 10) of the
 HOSPTIAL LOCATION file (#44). 
  
 Sorting and printing by PHYSICAL LOCATION will reduce the time required
 for facility staff to manually sort routing slips and provide improved
 Patient services. 
  
 Now if a patient has a prior appt in more than one clinic on the same day 
 his/her routing slip will print for each clinic by sorting and printing by
 PHYSICAL LOCATION
  
 A post install report listing of Clinics that do not have the Physical
 Location populated will be provided to assist the user.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HD63969 - MAD-0604-40367 - ROUTER PRINT  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 1. Routing slips required new sort and print ability. The sort and print 
 by the PHYSICAL LOCATION (#11) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION would reduce the
 time required for facility staff to manually sort routing slips
 to provide improved Patient services.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. Modifications to the scheduling package routing slip routines were
 required. A post install routine was created to identify clinics which
 would require the entry/edit of the PHYSICAL LOCATION (field #10) of the
 HOSPITAL LOCATION FILE (#44) in order for this modification to correctly
 sort and print the routing slips.
  
 Any location that does not have a PHYSICAL LOCATION in field #10 of
 the HOSPITAL LOCATION FILE(#44) will be assigned the generic value 
 of "Not Defined" and will sort accordingly when using the PHYSICAL 
 LOCATION option of the Routing Slips Output Option.
  
 Also fixed using this sort only- Now if a patient has a prior appt in more
 than one clinic on the same day his/her routing slip will print for each
 clinic by sorting and printing by PHYSICAL LOCATION.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 1. Problem:
    --------
 Routing slips were not designed to sort or print by PHYSICAL LOCATION (field
 10) of the HOSPTIAL LOCATION file (#44). Facility staff requested a new sort
 and print option which would reduce processing time and increase Patient
 services.
  
 2. Resolution:    
    -----------
 The routines SDROUT, SDROUT0, SDROUT1 and SDROUT2 required modifications
 to provide this functionality. In addition, a post-install routine was 
 created to provide the sites with a mail message containing missing
 PHYISCAL LOCATIONS (field 10) of the HOSPTIAL LOCATION file (#44).
