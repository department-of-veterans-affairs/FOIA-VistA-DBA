Associated patches: (v)RG*1*19     <<= must be installed BEFORE `RG*1*32'

Subject: MPI/PD EXCEPTION PURGE FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

    
 NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
 systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
 Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
 or subscribers.
    
 This patch addresses issues with the MPI/PD EXCEPTION PURGE option, 
 the option is not purging old exceptions with no value in the 
 EXCEPTION STATUS (#6) field of the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file.
 The option is also designed to not run if the ^TMP("RGEXC" global is
 present.  The global should only be present when a user is in the MPI/PD
 Exception Handler option. The problem has occurred that if the MPI/PD
 Exception Handler is exited improperly, the ^TMP global is left and the
 purge will not run.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1. VAC-0603-20450     INCORRECT EXCEPTION COUNT ON REPORT
    
    Problem:
    -------
    The report which can be run to report the number of exceptions by 
    type that exist at a facility is giving erroneous numbers, which are
    sometimes much higher than they should be. There may be numerous
    exceptions that have no status that should be purged automatically by
    the system, but they are not being purged.
   
    Resolution:
    ----------
    This patch corrects the MPI/PD EXCEPTION PURGE so that the old 
    exceptions with no value in the EXCEPTION STATUS (#6) field of the
    CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file are purged. A post installation 
    routine is also included to purge old exceptions that are missing
    data.
    
 2.CLE-0603-42283        UNABLE TO RUN EXCEPTION PURGE PROCESS
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The option is designed to not run if the ^TMP("RGEXC" global is
    present.  The global should only be present when a user is in the
    MPI/PD Exception Handler option.  The problem has occurred that if the
    MPI/PD Exception Handler is exited improperly, the ^TMP global is left
    and the purge will not run.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The option has been modified so that it will run if the ^TMP("RGEXC"
    global is present.  It will also run if there is a user in the MPI/PD
    Exception Handler, as long as data is not being updated.
