 **INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH IS TRANSPARENT TO USERS**
  
 PURPOSE OF THE PATCH
 ====================
 This patch contains a new API that will be used by VistA applications
 to integrate M-based Class I, Class III and local applications
 with the Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) Scheduling application being
 developed by the Scheduling Replacement team.
  
 The API will replace other methods of accessing the patient appointment
 information stored in the Patient sub-file(#2.98) and the Hospital 
 Location sub-file (#44.001).  During implementation of the new GOTS 
 Scheduler, this appointment information will be moved to the GOTS 
 database and deleted from the Scheduling files.
  
 Installing the patch will not modify existing functions or data in any
 way.  It contains nine routines.

 OVERVIEW
 ========
 The API is designed to be 'flexible' and will switch from the old 
 database source (VistA Scheduling files) to the new database source (GOTS
 SQL tables) without re-programming the requesting application.  Any 
 hard-coded or Fileman references to Scheduling globals in routines or data
 dictionaries that are not replaced with one of the Scheduling Replacement 
 APIs will cause the application to error.
  
 The API accepts user-specified criteria, in the form of an array, and 
 returns the matching appointment data.  The following appointment data
 can be requested:
  
   1. APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME
   2. CLINIC IEN and NAME
   3. APPOINTMENT STATUS AND DESCRIPTION
   4. PATIENT DFN and NAME
   5. LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT
   6. COMMENTS ("OTHER")
   7. OVERBOOK
   8. ELIGIBILITY OF VISIT ID and NAME
   9. CHECK-IN DATE/TIME
  10. APPOINTMENT TYPE IEN and NAME
  11. CHECK-OUT DATE/TIME
  12. OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER IEN
  13. PRIMARY STOP CODE IEN AND CODE
  14. CREDIT STOP CODE IEN AND CODE
  15. WORKLOAD NON-COUNT
  16. DATE APPOINTMENT MADE
  17. DESIRED DATE OF APPOINTMENT
  18. PURPOSE OF VISIT AND SHORT DESCRIPTION
  19. EKG DATE/TIME
  20. X-RAY DATE/TIME
  21. LAB DATE/TIME
  22. STATUS
  23. X-RAY FILMS

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours. Users can be on 
 the system. Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
    
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*301):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
             backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
             (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
             allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
             the transport global.
   
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*301.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES??//',respond NO.
   
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
