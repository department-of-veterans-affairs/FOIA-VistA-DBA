Subject: Blank sign/symptom problem

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patient Safety Issue - PSI-05-049 identifies a problem where an allergy
 may be stored without the corresponding drug classes or drug
 ingredients.  As a result, order checking may not occur as expected.
  
 In version 25 of the GUI, a change was made to the way allergies
 are entered.  When the list of signs/symptoms are displayed on
 the form the site's top ten entries are listed first and then there's
 a space and a dashed line and another space.  It's possible for the
 user to accidentally select the dashed line or the space as a 
 sign/symptom.  When this happens the system fails when attempting
 to store the allergy data.
  
 With this update, the allergy package will no longer attempt to
 store non-existent signs/symptoms.
  
 This patch also contains a post-installation routine that will
 attempt to identify any allergies that may not have been saved
 correctly.  Upon completion of the post-install, a report will be
 generated listing any patients and their associated allergies that
 need to be reviewed.  In general, the best course of action is to
 mark the existing allergy as entered in error and then re-enter
 the allergy information to make sure all required data is
 accounted for.
  
 PSI
 ===
 PSI-05-049: When entering an allergy for a patient in CPRS, when selecting
 an entry from the Signs/Symptoms window and drop down list, after the
 first 10 selection possibilities, there is a space, then a line, then 
 another space, then the rest of the possible selections from file 120.83. 
 If you click on one of the spaces or the line, it will be transferred to
 the Selected Symptoms window. If at this point you exit the entry process,
 an error occurs on the system. The record that gets created in file 120.8
 is incomplete. No Drug Ingredients or VA Drug classes are recorded and as
 a result, no order checks will work related to the entry.
  
 REMEDY
 ======
 90006 - Error when entering allergies.
 94503 - Subscript error when entering allergies via GUI
  
 During the selection of signs/symptoms in CPRS GUI v25, it was possible 
 to select the solid line as a sign/symptom.  When this data is passed to 
 the allergy package for storage, it errors out when encountering the 
 solid line.  After installing this patch, the solid line will be ignored 
 and all of the other valid data will be stored.  With CPRS GUI v26, you 
 will no longer be able to select the line.

 INSTALLATION
 ============

 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users entering allergy information during the 
 installation process.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes to 
 install.
  
 ************************************************************************
 NOTE: This patch includes a post-install that will check to see if you 
 have any allergies on file that need to be reviewed for accuracy of 
 data.  A mail message will be sent with a list of patients and the 
 respective allergies should there be any to fix.  If there are no entries 
 to fix you'll simply receive an email indicating that the post-install 
 finished.
