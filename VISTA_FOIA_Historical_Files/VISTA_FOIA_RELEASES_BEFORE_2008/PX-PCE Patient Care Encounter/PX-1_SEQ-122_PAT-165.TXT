 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 MAC-0205-61378  Errors on print from patient list
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When choosing to print the report using option PXRR PATIENT ACTIVITY 
 BY LOC, the user receives an undefined error for a missing entry
 point 'FMDFINVL' in routine PXRMDATE. The release of version 2.0
 for Clinical Reminders is the root of the problem.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify routine PXRRPAPI by adding the inverted date logic formerly
 located in routine PXRMDATE, but accidently removed. Logic will be
 added at tag 'FMDFINVL'.
