Description: 
============

 This patch is a means to distribute Encounter Forms to the field in 
 accordance to "Veterans Health Administration Revenue Cycle Improvement 
 Plan", Final Report, September 2001.
  
 The following forms will be included in this patch.
  
     NATIONAL GI                     
     NATIONAL UROLOGY                
     NATIONAL PULMONARY              
     NATIONAL PODIATRY               
     NATIONAL EYE                    
  
 "Secretary Principi directed the Under Secretary for Health, through the 
 VHA Chief Financial Officer, to develop a revenue cycle improvement plan. 
 To accomplish this charge, the VHA Chief Financial Officer assembled two 
 groups of experts in the form of two distinct committees:  (i) VHA 
 Revenue Cycle Steering Committee -- comprised of a diverse group of VA 
 senior management -- provided vision and strategic oversight of the plan; 
 (ii) VHA Revenue Cycle Work Group, comprised of Central Office and field 
 staff, which developed the detailed recommendations of the plan."
  
 "This vision of the Revenue Program is based on two solid principles: the 
 principles of standardization and accountability.  The standardization of 
 policy, technology, data capture, measurement, and training and education 
 should enhance VHA's ability to effectively manage its revenue cycle."
  
 Within this report, the following was tasked.
  
 "Develop and mandate use of electronic encounter forms & documentation 
 templates"
  
 Rationale
 ---------
 VHA provider documentation, in many instances, lacks the required 
 elements that result in either a non-billable service or a lower valued 
 service.  Each VISN, and in many cases, each line of service, may use 
 different encounter forms and documentation templates for encounter data 
 capture. 
  
 Description 
 -----------
 This plan proposes collaboration among Revenue Office and OI staff to 
 develop standardized, electronic encounter forms for use in the CPRS 
 system that can be used throughout the VHA by clinicians.  Providers at 
 several medical centers contributed their expertise in the development of
 the documentation templates and the encounter forms.  After completing
 their review, they suggested broadening the code sets, as well as
 sectioning the forms.  This would allow clinicians easier access to the
 the appropriate code(s).The use of the electronic claim form will
 eliminate the need for manual data entry into PCE or Appointment
 Manager.  These encounter forms will ensure the standardization of code
 sets for specialty areas in the near-term and all areas eventually; they
 will reduce or eliminate the data validation required by coders to ensure
 proper code assignment.  This patch is to correct problems relating to
 encounter forms only.
  
 Outcome(s)
 ----------
 Electronic encounter forms will benefit VHA through improved quality of
 data capture.  In addition, the implementation of national encounter forms
 will eliminate the manpower required to create encounter forms at each 
 facility while also ensuring standardization.
  
 A new performance measure is being developed to monitor the percentage of 
 encounters with electronic notes.
  
 NOTE:  After the release of annual procedure and diagnosis codes updates, 
 appropriate menu options on the Maintenance Utility for Active/Inactive 
 Codes [IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY] menu will need to be used to ensure
 the accuracy of each released form in use at your facility (attached to a
 clinic).  Also, codes that have changes to the definition must be
 evaluated for appropriateness.  A patch will be released to update the
 ICD-9-CM and CPT codes on the toolkit forms annually through 2004.
