Description:
============

 Due to the large amount of data associated with this patch, the
 changes for this patch are distributed in a host file, RA_5_79.KID.
 Please refer to the section "Host File Retrieval and Documentation" 
 (below) for retrieval of this host file.
  
 This patch is not associated with any Remedy tickets, it is part of 
 NSR 20050207.
  
 This patch adds a new Fileman file, RADIOLOGY CPT BY PROCEDURE TYPE 
 (#73.2) to this application.  The data for this file are supplied by the 
 Office of Patient Care Services and include PROCEDURE TYPE and CPT CODE.
  
 The 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] option for Outpatient
 Procedure Wait Time has been revised to use "PROCEDURE TYPE" for Wait 
 Times from this file to group cases, instead of "TYPE OF IMAGING" from the
 IMAGING TYPE file (#79.2) to group cases.  Cases are associated to the
 PROCEDURE TYPE via its procedure's CPT CODE.
  
 The user prompt for:
          I   Imaging Type
          P   Procedure Name/CPT Code
  
           What do you want to choose next: I// 
  
 Has been changed to:
          C   CPT Code/Procedure Name
          P   Procedure Type
  
           What do you want to choose next: P//
  
 Previously, the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] option 
 counted only the first case from a printset and excluded the remainder 
 cases.  Now, it will count the case from the printset that has the highest
 ranked modality and exclude the remainder cases.  The modalities are 
 ranked in this order, (1) being the highest:
     (1) Interventional,      (2) MRI,            (3) CT,    
     (4) Cardiac Stress Test, (5) Nuc Med,        (6) US,
     (7) Mammo,               (8) General Rad,    (9) Other
  
 At this time, cases in the RADIATION THERAPY group will be excluded from 
 the summary and detail reports, because not all sites use the 
 Radiology/Nuc Med package to enter data for Radiation Therapy.  The 
 display of "All PROCEDURE TYPES" in the user option and the display of 
 "PROCEDURE TYPES: All" in both report headers will include "except
 RADIATION THERAPY".
  
  
  
 Revisions to the Summary Report
 -------------------------------
  
 1.  The selection of individual Imaging Types have been removed.
 2.  The page heading will display either "PROCEDURE TYPE" or "CPT CODES 
     and PROCEDURES", but not both.
 3.  The "average number of days wait" is removed.
 4.  The percentages and counts are in separate tables, grouped by 
     PROCEDURE TYPE.
 5.  A screen pause has been inserted between the tables.
 6.  A footnote has been added to define "Procedure Type".
 7.  If the user selects by "CPT Code/Procedure Name", then the output will
     not display a row if it contains all 0's.
  
 Here are examples of the new tables within the revised summary report :

 Revisions to the Detail Report
 ------------------------------
  
 1.  The selection of individual Imaging Types have been removed.
 2.  The page heading will display either "PROCEDURE TYPE" or "CPT CODES 
     and PROCEDURES", but not both.
 3.  A new column, "PROC. TYPE", is added to the far right of the output.

 7.  A "p" will be displayed to the immediate left of the case number, to
     indicate that the case is the highest ranked modality from a
     printset and passed the business rules for inclusion.  A footnote has
     also been added to explain the "p" in the printout.

 The data are supplied by the Office of Patient Care Services and cannot 
 be edited locally.  Records may be added by this Office via a new
 Radiology patch.  Existing records may be updated but never deleted by
 this Office.
  
  
 Routines modified
 =================
  
 Routines RAPMW, RAPMW1, and RAPMW2 have been modified to make the above 
 changes.
  
 Routine RAPMW3 is new but is not included in this patch because it is 
 only used by the field office to import an Excel spreadsheet into the new
 file, RADIOLOGY CPT BY PROCEDURE TYPE (#73.2).
  
 Host File Retrieval and Documentation
 =====================================
  
 The modified routines and the new file, RADIOLOGY CPT BY PROCEDURE TYPE 
 (#73.2), are exported in a host file, RA_5_79.KID.  
  
 Two manuals have been updated for this patch:  
    User Manual (RA5_0UM.PDF)
    Tech Manual (RA5_0TM.PDF)
  
 The host file and the new manuals can be found in the following 
 [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE] directories:

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   The install time for this patch should take less than 5 minutes.  This 
 includes the time to import the new file and its data. Radiology users may
 remain on the system during the installation, because only the  RA TIME*  
 options need to be locked during the installation.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. Retrieve the host file, RA_5_79.KID, from one of the FTP addresses 
     listed above.
  
  2. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
  
      a. Load a Distribution - this option will load the host file from
         step 1.  You will need to include the directory name where you 
         have stored the host file.
   
      From this point on, when prompted for "INSTALL NAME:", enter: 
         RA*5.0*79
  
      b. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  3. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
  
         When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*79.
    
         When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//", respond NO.
   
         When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? YES//", respond YES.
  
         When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
         enter the following:
      
           RA TIME*
   
         When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of 
         Order':", press the RETURN key to skip this prompt, since there
         are no protocols to place out of order.
   
  4. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*79).
