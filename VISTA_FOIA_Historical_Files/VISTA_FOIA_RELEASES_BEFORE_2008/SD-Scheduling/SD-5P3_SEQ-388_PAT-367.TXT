Subject: STOP MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF PCMM HL7 TRANS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem associated with the PCMM HL7 Transmission
 process.  Running the PCMM HL7 Transmission [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT]
 option when there is a current transmission running already has led to
 system degradation and, in some instances, crashes have been reported.

 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ====================
 1. HD63734 - PCMM RESEEDING UPDATE REQUEST.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This problem is occurring when multiple transmissions of the PCMM HL7 data
 are being transmitted to ACC. If the first instance of the transmission
 has not completed and a second instance is tasked the site reports that
 the system is compromised, and in some cases crashes have been reported.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch has been created to prevent multiple PCMM HL7 tasks from
 running if the previously queued task has not completed.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
  
 Problem:
 ========
 There were no existing limitations on how many PCMM HL7 transmissions 
 could be running at the same time.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The routine SCMCHL will be modified to not allow the transmission to 
 begin if there is an existing transmission in progress. The user will be 
 given a message that the "HL7 Transmission is in progress, please try 
 again later."
