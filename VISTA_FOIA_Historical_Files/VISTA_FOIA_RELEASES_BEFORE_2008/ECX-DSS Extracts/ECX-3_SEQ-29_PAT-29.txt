Description: 
============

   
   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 patch ECX*3*24, and are generating extracts for 
   FY2000 data.
   
   Please insure that the DSS Site Manager obtains a copy of this
   patch description.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
   Please note: 
   Release of this patch is covered by the VistA Y2K Moratorium
   Waiver.  It may be installed anytime before 12/15/1999 or after
   01/15/2000.
   
   Patch ECX*3*29 provides an additional enhancement to the CLI extract
   logic for FY2000 processing per new specifications provided by the
   Bedford Technical Services Office (BTSO).
    
   This patch must be installed before any CLI extracts for FY2000
   are generated.
   
   Previously, Clinic data for an outpatient encounter associated with 
   a stop to Xray (105), Lab (108), an appended EKG visit (107), or a 
   disposition was not included in the CLI extract record.
   
   After installation of ECX*3*29, Clinic data will be included in 
   every CLI extract record.

   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the

       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
