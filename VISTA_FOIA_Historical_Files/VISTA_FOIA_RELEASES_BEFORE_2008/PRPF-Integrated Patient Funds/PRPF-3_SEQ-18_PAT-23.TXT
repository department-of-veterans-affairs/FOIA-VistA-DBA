 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:                 ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
  Hines:                  ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
