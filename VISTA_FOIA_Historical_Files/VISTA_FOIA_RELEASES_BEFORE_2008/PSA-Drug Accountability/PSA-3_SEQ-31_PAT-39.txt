Subject: DRUG NAME STUFFED INTO NDC FIELD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will modify Process Uploaded Prime Vendor Invoice Data to always 
 prompt the user when there is a change in the Vendor Stock Number's NDC.  
 This is currently happening only if the current NDC is numeric.
 
 This patch does not conflict with CoreFLS.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 SPO-1003-52362		PSA PROCESS PRIME VENDOR DATA	Process Uploaded Prime
 							Vendor Invoice Data 
 
 Problem:
 --------
 When processing uploaded vendor invoices, if the NDC code on the invoice is
 different than the NDC code in the Drug File (#50) and the Drug File (#50) NDC
 code is numeric then the user is prompted if the new NDC code is correct prior
 to updating the Drug file (#50).  If the NDC code on the invoice is different
 than the NDC code in the Drug File (#50) and the Drug File (#50) NDC code is
 not numeric, the user is not prompted if the new NDC code is correct prior to
 updating the Drug file (#50).  When the Drug file (#50) is updated a new
 synonym is created and the Drug file (#50) NDC code is changed.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify the processing of uploaded vendor invoices so the user is prompted if
 the new NDC code is correct even if the new NDC code is non-numeric.

 SPO-1003-52362		PSA PROCESS PRIME VENDOR DATA	Process Uploaded Prime
 							Vendor Invoice Data
 Problem:
 -------- 
 When processing an uploaded invoice, if the NDC code from the invoice does not
 match the Drug file (#50) NDC code for non-supply items, the user is only
 prompted if the new NDC code is correct if the current Drug file (#50) NDC
 code is numeric.  Need to modify routine PSAPROC9.

 DISTRIBUTION:
 =============
 This patch is exported using KIDS.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because the option 
 will be out of service during the installation process it is suggested 
 that it be queued for non-peak hours.
 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
    
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
      
 2. (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
       for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.  
  
       NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in 
       your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
 
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*39)
     
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
     
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
    PSA*3.0*39
     
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//', respond NO
     
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
    you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
 
 PSA PROCESS PRIME VENDOR DATA	Process Uploaded Prime Vendor Invoice Data
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation 
    has run to completion.
