Description:
============

  Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation &
  Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) Phase II provides VistA updates
  necessary to support the new Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam
  template functionality implemented during Phase I of the CAPRI
  CPWM project.
  
  The goal of the CAPRI CPWM project is to implement the current
  Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) C&P exam worksheets
  in an electronic format that will upload exam results into Text
  Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to Computerized
  Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
  CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
  Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*71.  This CAPRI GUI
  version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
  the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
  exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
  Please refer to patch DVBA*2.7*71 for further information on CAPRI CPWM.

  USER SETUP
  ==========
  To activate CPWM for a particular user, the DVBA CAPRI GUI menu option
  and several keys must be assigned:
  
  1.  DVBA CAPRI GUI - This is the option context to the main CAPRI
      application.  All CAPRI users will need this menu option assigned.
  
  2.  DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB - This security key makes the C&P Worksheets
      tab visible inside CAPRI.  All VHA CAPRI users should get this key.
  
  3.  Depending on the local processes established at each site, ONE of the
      following security keys MUST be assigned for anyone who will be
      creating new C&P exam templates with CPWM.
  
      a.  DVBAB CPWM DISALLOW REVIEW - User doesn't need their documents
          reviewed prior to release.
  
      b.  DVBAB CPWM OPTIONAL REVIEW - User can choose to send some
          documents for review and not other documents.
   
      c.  DVBAB CPWM REQUIRE REVIEW - User must have all documents reviewed
          by a reviewer prior to upload.
  
  4.  DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER - If the site chooses to uses the review process
      (by assigning anyone either the OPTIONAL or REQUIRE REVIEW keys), one
      or more users MUST be designated as a reviewer and assigned the DVBAB
      CPWM REVIEWER key.
  
  IRM will need to coordinate with C&P staff to determine what keys a user
  should receive.  The majority of users will need only two new keys (the
  WORKSHEET TAB key and one of the REVIEW keys).  Users designated as
  reviewers will additionally need the CPWM REVIEWER key.
