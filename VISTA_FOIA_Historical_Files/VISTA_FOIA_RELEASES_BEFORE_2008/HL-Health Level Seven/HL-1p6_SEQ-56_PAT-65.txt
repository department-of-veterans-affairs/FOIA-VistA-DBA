Subject: ENHANCE SYSTEM LINK MONITOR

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description: 
============

   
  This patch addresses the following issues:
   1. Corrects problem creating an acknowledgement message MSH for a serial
      connection.
   2. Enhancements to the System Link Monitor.  Display is now alphabetical
      and views can also be defined. Use the 'Site Parameter Edit' option
      to create Link Monitor VIEWS. See Documentation below for example.
   3. New computed field in file 773, MESSAGE SIZE. This field counts the
      number of characters in a message.  It can be used in FileMan reports.
   4. Update the INITIAL MESSAGE field in file 773 for a response to a Direct
      Connect message. This is for the Remote Data View project.
  
  
  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  
   
    2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
   
        the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from 
        the mapped set at this time.  
   
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager. Use the options:
   
          Filer and Link Management Options -> 
              SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
              LM     TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop
  
        For DSM sites ONLY, disabled all HL7 UCX Services 
        for this installation.
   
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
   
    5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
        options: 
   
           2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           3 Print Transport Global 
           4 Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           5 Backup a Transport Global 
           6 Install Package(s) 
               INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*65
                             =========
    
          Answer 'NO' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?'.
  
          Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
           and Protocols?'.
  
    6.  Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers. Use the 
   
          Filer and Link Management Options ->
              RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
          (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need to
          be restarted manually)
     
        For DSM sites ONLY, if you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
        for this installation, you may now enable it.
   
    7.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
   
    8.  Start Link Manager using the option: "TCP/IP
          Link Manager Start/Stop."

 Documentation:
 ==============
  
 ADPACs and Site Managers now have the ability to define what links they 
 wish to see in the System Link Monitor.  As an example, a site may wish to 
 define a view of all the links that are in their VISN. They would name this 
 view, VISN 99.
