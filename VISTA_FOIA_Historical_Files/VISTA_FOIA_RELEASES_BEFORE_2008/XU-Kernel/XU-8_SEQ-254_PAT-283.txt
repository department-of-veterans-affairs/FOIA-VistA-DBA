 Patch Tracking #: 35703753
 Test Sites: Hines VAMC.
 Blood Bank Clearance: 2/20/2003
  
 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group, in 
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested 
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot 
 project, named Public Key Infrastructure for Electronic Prescriptions 
 Pilot Project. The objective is to develop an electronic order entry 
 system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital signatures. A 
 Memorandum of Understanding between the DEA and the Department of 
 Veterans Affairs authorizes only specified sites to use the full 
 functionality of this pilot, although additional functionality is 
 included that will benefit non-pilot sites. This patch contains the 
 functionality required for this pilot and lays the foundations for the 
 future implementation of the PKI once the DEA regulations are revised 
 and published. It is installed with the PKI functionality disabled and 
 will not have any impact until the PKI functionality is enabled. PKI 
 functionality can be enabled via Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) parameters at a site level and a user level. Additional hardware 
 and software is required from various sources before PKI can be 
 implemented at a site. DO NOT enable the PKI parameters until all 
 required software and hardware has been installed.
  
 To make this project viable, modifications to the following packages 
 were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0  (This patch and XU*8*288)
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0

       the installation and implementation of PKI for DEA/VA Schedule II 
       drugs.

 ***
 This patch creates a new global ^XUSSPKI, which should be placed before 
 installing the patch.  Following national deployment, a site could see 
 approximately 3000 characters in this file for every Schedule II, III, and 
 IV out patient drug that is prescribed.  This data must be held for a 
 minimum of two years.
 ***
  
   Post install instructions only for a site in the pilot:
  
       1. Use the "Kernel PKI Parameter Edit" option [XUSSPKI EDIT] to 
       edit/enter the IP address of the Verification Server. 
       
       2. Use the "Mail Group Edit" option [XMEDITMG] to add users to the 
       "XUSSPKI CRL SERVER" mail group. 
       
       3. If you need debug information, use the General Parameter Tools 
       option [XPAR MENU TOOLS] to set the value of the XUSC1 DEBUG 
       parameter to 1 for debug logging. 
       
       4. From EVE, go to TaskMan's "Schedule/Unschedule Options" option and 
       schedule "XUSSPKI CRL UPLOAD" to run once an hour.
  
       5. From one of the national download site get the following files. 
       a. XuDigSigSC.exe  This is a self-extracting ZIP file of a install 
       disk, that expands into C:\temp\PKI-c\. Switch to this folder and 
       Double click on the SETUP icon.  This will install the signing COM 
       file (XuDigSigSC.exe) into C:\program files\vista\Common files\ and 
       register it.It installs a COM object that is used by CPRS when doing 
       a digital signature.  It will need to be installed on each 
       workstation.
          
       b. XuDigVerify.exe   It gets installed on the Verification Server, a 
       Windows 2K Pro box provided by the site. This is a self- extracting 
       ZIP file of a install disk, that expands into C:\temp\PKI-v\. Switch 
       to this folder and Double click on the SETUP icon. It runs two 
       services that are used by Pharmacy to verify the digital signature.
