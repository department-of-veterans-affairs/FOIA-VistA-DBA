Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*19 is a required build for patch RG*1*21.
   
  This patch includes enhancements that are proposed in the Master
  Patient Index / Patient Demographics, Phase III Enhancements, Software
  Design Document.
   
  1. A new option, Add/Edit Point of Contact [RG UPDATE POINT OF
     CONTACT] is included in this patch.  This option allows a facility
     to transmit information to the Master Patient Index / Patient
     Demographics (MPI/PD) Data Management team so that the Point of
     Contact website can be updated.  The data comes from the ADMIN POINT
     OF CONTACT (#50), ALT ADMIN POINT OF CONTACT (#53), IRM POINT OF
     CONTACT (#51), ALT IRM POINT OF CONTACT (#54), HL7 POINT OF CONTACT
     (#52), and ALT HL7 POINT OF CONTACT (#55) fields in the CIRN SITE
     PARAMETER (#991.8) file as well as the COMMERCIAL PHONE (#.135) field
     in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for each of these individuals.
   
     The user can select all or a list or range of fields to edit.
     After the selected name(s) and phone number(s) have been edited, if
     a change has been made, that information is sent in an E-Mail message
     to the MPI/PD POC UPDATE mail group on the Austin MPI.  Members of
     that mail group will keep the Point of Contact website up-to-date.
   
  2. A diagnostic tool that has been on your system as a class III
     product is being moved into class I routines and options.  The
     options are stand alone options and are not attached to any menu.
     The diagnostic tool will continue to be used primarily by the
     MPI/PD development team and National VistA Support (NVS) for the
     purpose of diagnosing Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging problems.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
  or subscribers.
   
  New Options:
  ============
  1.  The Add/Edit Point of Contact [RG UPDATE POINT OF CONTACT] option
  has been added to the MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN
  COORD MENU].  This option allows a facility to update their point of
  contact information for Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
  (MPI/PD).  Names and phone numbers can be edited for the administrative,
  Information Resource Management (IRM), HL7, and alternate contacts.  At
  the conclusion of the edit process, the information is transmitted to
  a remote mail group on the Austin MPI system.  The Data Management staff
  will use this information to update the website.
  2.  The MPI/PD HL7 Diagnostic Menu [RGMT DIAG MGR] is a stand alone
  menu that should not be attached to any menu.  This diagnostic
  tool will be used primarily by the MPI/PD development team and NVS.
  3.  The Compile MPI/PD HL7 Data [RGMT DIAG COMPILE HL7 DATA] option
  searches the HL7 MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION (#773) file for a selected date
  range.  For each message in the date range, the HL7 MESSAGE TEXT (#772)
  file is examined.  If the RELATED EVENT PROTOCOL (#10) field contains
  the MPI/PD protocols (e.g., "VAF", "RG", or "MPIF"), information is
  compiled into an array for examination.
  4.  The MPI/PD HL7 Message Status Report [RGMT DIAG STATUS REPORT]
  option prints information found during the Compile MPI/PD HL7 Data
  compilation.  The report is sorted by RELATED EVENT PROTOCOL, date,
  transmission type, and status.  Either a detailed or summary report
  can be printed for a selected date range.
  5.  The MPI/PD HL7 Activity by Patient/Single Protocol [RGMT DIAG
  SINGLE PROTOCOL] option prints information found during the Compile
  MPI/PD HL7 Data compilation for activity related to a specific protocol.
  The report prints the patient's name, protocol, date range, transmission
  type, internal entry number (IEN) from the HL7 MESSAGE TEXT (#772) file,
  the date, and status.  The HL7 message data found in the MESSAGE TEXT
  (#200) field is displayed.
  6.  The MPI/PD HL7 Activity by Patient/All Protocols [RGMT DIAG ALL
  PROTOCOLS] option prints information found during the Compile MPI/PD 
  HL7 Data compilation for activity related to ALL protocols.  The report
  prints the patient's name, date range, protocol, transmission type,
  internal entry number (IEN) from the HL7 MESSAGE TEXT (#772) file, the
  date, and status.  The HL7 message data found in the MESSAGE TEXT (#200)
  field is displayed.
   
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  Six new fields are added to the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file.
   
  The ADMIN POINT OF CONTACT (#50) field contains the name of the individual
  at the facility who is in a position to resolve patient issues for
  Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics.
   
  The IRM POINT OF CONTACT (#51) field contains the name of the individual
  at the facility who supports the VistA Master Patient Index/Patient
  Demographics application.  
   
  The HL7 POINT OF CONTACT (#52) field contains the name of the individual
  at the facility who supports the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
  application.  Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics uses HL7 for
  message transmission and frequently needs to contact the HL7 point
  of contact.
   
  The ALT ADMIN POINT OF CONTACT (#53) field contains the name of a second
  individual at the facility who is in a position to resolve patient issues
  for Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics.
   
  The ALT IRM POINT OF CONTACT (#54) field contains the name of a second
  individual at the facility who supports the VistA Master Patient Index/
  Patient Demographics application.
   
  The ALT HL7 POINT OF CONTACT (#55) field contains the name of a second
  individual at the facility who supports the VistA Health Level Seven
  (HL7) application.  Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics uses HL7
  for message transmission and frequently needs to contact the HL7 point
  of contact.
   
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following documentation files are exported as part of this patch.
  These manuals have been completely revised to reflect the changes in
  RG*1*21 and MPIF*1*11.
   
      RG1_0_UM.PDF     Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
                       (MPI/PD) User Manual
      RG1_0_TM.PDF     Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
                       (MPI/PD) Technical Manual
   
  The files can be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is to
  get the files from:  download.vista.med.va.gov.
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
