Subject: NPPD-DENVER ACQ & LOG CENTER(DALC)INTERFACE _ OEF/OIF SYMBOL ADDED TO PURCH DIS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1.   This patch was developed as a deliverable for IT Service
 Request #20010102 requesting enhancements to NPPD.
  
 The main objective of this software is to record items that were
 Purchased by Denver  Acquisition and Logistics Center (DALC); including
 received, issued, repaired, adjusted or credit issued by the DALC.  These
 items are recorded in the Prosthetics Patient Treatment Record, screen 4
 as a single line item per item.  A complete history will be maintained
 regarding items of issuance and cost.  These records will be extracted by 
 NPPD on a regular basis and reconciled to other national data feeds.
  
 2.      To accommodate the need to bring to the focus the Veterans that 
 are designated as Operation Enduring Freedom & Operation Iraqi Freedom 
 OEF/OIF the Purchase Order Control,NPPD GUI,Delayed Order Report,
 OWL-Orthotics Work Order and Lab and View Prosthetics Billing Information
 screens will have the following designation for these Veterans.
  
 <!>Veterans Name
  
 ** Please note that because of the added descriptive symbol <!> in the 
 patient name, the list when sorted alphabetically will group these 
 patients together; at the beginning or at the end depending on whether it 
 is sorted in ascending or descending order.
  
 Option changes: 
 ================ 
  
 1)  DALC SERVER [RMPR DALC]
  
 This is a non-interactive option of type: server.  When the DALC sends 
 data the option will automatically start to populate that data into the 
 RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE (#660).
  
 2)  OF     Print OIF/OEF Suspense List [RMPR PRINT OIF/OEF SUSPENSE]
  
 Found under the Suspense Menu will print patients in the Suspense file 
 #668 with the OIF/OEF designation.
  
 3)  NOF    Print OIF/OEF Items Issued
  
 Found under the NPPD Tools Menu will print patients in the RECORD OF PROS 
 APPLIANCE/REPAIR file #660 with the OIF/OEF designation.
