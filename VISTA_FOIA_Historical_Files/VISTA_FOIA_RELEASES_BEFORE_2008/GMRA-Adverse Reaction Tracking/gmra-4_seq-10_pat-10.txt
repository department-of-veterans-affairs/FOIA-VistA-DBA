Subject: GMRADPT Utility update

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The GMRADPT utility routine will be modified to make two changes
 to the GMRAL array.  The first change came at the request of the
 Pharmacy developers.  They wanted to have the utility return the
 IEN and the Global root associated with the reactant identified with
 the patient reaction.  The GMRAL array has an entry for each reaction
 that is on file for a given patient.  The zero (0) node for each
 entry has been modified to include this information on the 9th piece
 of the zero node.  The in-line documentation for the GMRADPT routine
 refers to this as piece "I".  A description of all of the information
 returned from this call can be found in the GMRADPT routine.
  
 The GMRAL array was also involved in a notification message that was
 sent out in June of 1996.  The following information was extracted
 from forum message # 20863738 which describes the notification
 change:
  
 "The Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) utility routine, GMRADPT, currently
 returns the GMRAL array if the patient has reactions recorded in the ART
 database or the patient is considered by the ART database as having no
 known reactions. The utility also returns a variable, GMRAL, which is set
 to 0, 1 or null (patient has no known reactions, patient has reactions on
 file, and patient is not in the ART database).
  
  
 Currently: 
                                        Returns GMRAL Array  GMRAL Variable
                                        -------------------  --------------
  Patient has no known reactions                 Yes              0
  Patient has reactions                          Yes              1
  Patient is not in the ART database             No               null
  
  
 After January 1, 1998
                                        Returns GMRAL Array  GMRAL Variable
                                        -------------------  --------------
  Patient has no known reactions           --->  No  <---         0
  Patient has reactions                          Yes              1
  Patient is not in the ART database             No               null
  
 The other input and output variables remain the same. The documentation
 for the variables is included in DBIA #10099."
  
 The above described change will be in effect after the installation
 of this patch.
  
 1. Routine: GMRADPT
    This routine was modified to accommodate the two requests for
 changes to the GMRAL array.

 INSTALLATION
 ============
   This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation
   will take less than two minutes.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
       load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
   
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
       removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
       select the Installation menu.
     
   4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
       options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*10):
    
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       b.  Print Transport Global
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
       d.  Backup a Transport Global
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       GMRA*4.0*10.
    
   6.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
       Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO"
   
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
       should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
       has run to completion.
