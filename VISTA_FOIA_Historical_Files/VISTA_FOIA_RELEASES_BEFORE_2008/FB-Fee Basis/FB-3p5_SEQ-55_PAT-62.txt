Subject: MILL BILL EMERGENCY CARE SUMMARY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 IRM SHOULD PROVIDE THE FEE STAFF WITH A COPY OF THIS PATCH
 DESCRIPTION.
  
  
 This patch will provide a new report to the Unauthorized Claims module
 of the VistA Fee Basis application. The report will print statistics
 for 38 U.S.C. 1725 emergency care claims that were entered into the
 system within a user specified date range. The purpose of the report
 is to automate the development of emergency care claim summary
 statistics that sites must report to the Chief Business Office (CBO)
 on a monthly basis. The CBO uses the monthly input from sites to
 prepare the Millennium Act Emergency Care report, which is required
 by Congress.
  
 This patch will greatly benefit sites by providing a mechanism to
 systematically generate the required statistics, which save local
 facility staff time. This report will only benefit those sites that
 are entering all non-VA emergency care claims data into the VistA
 Fee Basis application.
  
 This patch adds the new option Millennium Act Emergency Care Summary
 Report [FBUC MILL ACT SUMMARY] to the Outputs for Unauthorized Claims
 [FBUC OUTPUTS] menu.
  
 This patch releases the new routine FBUCMBS which is invoked by
 running the Millennium Act Emergency Care Summary Report [FBUC MILL
 ACT SUMMARY] option. This new routine will prompt the user for a Start
 Date and End Date. These dates are based on the .01 field of file
 162.7 (FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS FILE) and is the
 DATE CLAIM RECEIVED. 
  
 After the user has entered a Start Date, End Date, and Device to print
 the report, the routine will:
  
 A. Determine if the claim is being considered under Millennium Act
    38 U.S.C. 1725 based on field 31 of file 162.7 equaling 'YES' or
    this field being set to 1.
  
 B. Count each claim and add to a running total equaling Total Number
    Claims Received.
  
 C. Determine the Amount Claimed based on field 8 of file 162.7 and add
    to a running total equaling Total Dollars Claims Received.
  
 D. Determine the claimant based on CLAIM SUBMITTED BY, field 23 of
    file 162.7. This claimant is then temporarily stored in
    ^TMP($J,"FBUCMBS","CLMT" keeping claimants unique. Unique claimants
    are counted equaling Total Claimants.
  
 E. Determine the DISPOSITION, field 10 of file 162.7. This field is
    a pointer to file 162.91, FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS DISPOSITIONS
    file. Valid dispositions are:
  
    1. APPROVED
    2. APPROVED TO STABILIZATION
    3. ABANDONED
    4. CANCELLED/WITHDRAWN
    5. DISAPPROVED
  
       a. If the claim was not dispositioned it will be counted as a
          Pending claim and both the AMOUNT CLAIMED and each Pending
          claim will be added to running totals equaling Total Number
          Claims Pending and Total Dollars Claims Pending.
  
       b. If the claim was dispositioned as Approved or Approved to
          Stabilization the AMOUNT APPROVED is computed using Fee 
          Basis batch payment data and each claim will be added 
          to running totals equaling Total Claims Paid and Total 
          Dollars Claims Paid. After counting these claims and the 
          dollars associated these claims will be calculated for 
          Average Processing Time.
  
       c. All remaining claims with dispositions of Abandoned,
          Cancelled/Withdrawn, and Disapproved will be processed to
          ascertain the reason for denial as in the case of claims
          which have been Disapproved. Claims Disapproved will be
          added to a running total equaling Total Number Claims
          Rejected with the Amount Claimed added to Total Dollars
          Claims Rejected. Each reason for denial is added to a
          temporary array stored in ^TMP($J,"FBUCMBS","REAS".
          REASON FOR DISAPPROVAL, field 15 of file 162.7, is a
          multiple field which points to file 162.94 (FEE BASIS
          UNAUTHORIZED DISAPPROVAL REASONS). In this case only the
          first reason entered is collected for the Millennium Act
          Emergency Care Summary Report. Valid Reasons For Denial are:
  
          1. 1725 INFO NOT REC'D TIMELY
          2. 1725 NON-EMERGENT CARE
          3. 1725 NOT TIMELY FILED
          4. ADJUDICATION REQUESTED
          5. DENIAL OF TRAVEL
          6. HAS OTHER INS. BENEFITS
          7. NO VA TX, PAST 24 MTHS
          8. NON-EMERGENT CARE
          9. NOT LIABLE FOR PAYMENT
         10. NOT TIMELY FILED
         11. NSC CONDITION
         12. NSC VETERAN
         13. PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED
         14. VA FACILITIES AVAILABLE
         15. VETERAN NOT ENROLLED
  
          Further processing continues determining the Average
          Processing Time of the claim.
  
       d. Finally after processing the last record for a given date
          range the summary report is produced. For example:

 Instructions to sites:
 ======================
 The Millennium Act Emergency Care Summary Report Option [FBUC MILL ACT 
 SUMMARY], allows you to run "Mill Bill" activity for any selected period, 
 however for Central Office reporting purposes the report must be run three
 times.  First, cumulative data is obtained by running it from 5/29/00
 through the end of the month being reported.  Second, fiscal year to date
 is obtained by running it from October 1st of the current fiscal year
 through the end of the month being reported.  Third, run it from the first
 to the last day of the month being reported to obtain monthly data.
  
 Enter the three sets of figures into an Excel spreadsheet and send them, 
 through appropriate channels,  to the VISN Business Office.  The VISN will
 compile the statistics for all their facilities and submit them to the
 Program Analyst, Fee Basis Program, Chief Business Office (16), VACO.
