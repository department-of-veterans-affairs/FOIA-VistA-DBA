Description:
============

  NOTE: The software for this patch, RG*1*43, and associated patch
        MPIF*1*43 is not being distributed through the National Patch
        Module.  These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS
        software distribution (host file).  This patch contains the
        informational portion of RG*1*43.  Please refer to the 'Software
        Retrieval' and 'Installation Instructions' sections in the
        description for patch MPIF*1*43 for the instructions on how to
        acquire and install the patch software.
   
  NOTE: RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
        systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
        Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*43, RG*1.0*35, and RG*1.0*39 are required builds for
  patch RG*1*43.
   
  Issue #1 - Menu Structure Changes
  With the change in the processing of patients against the Master
  Patient Index (MPI) where all patients now receive a national ICN
  unless the MPI is unavailable, the Single Patient Initialization
  [MPIF IND MPI LOAD] option and the SPI action within the MPI/PD
  Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option are no longer
  needed in VistA.
   
  Because these options are in different namespaces, they will be
  deleted in the following separate patches:
  Patch MPIF*1*43 will remove the Single Patient Initialization
  [MPIF IND MPI LOAD] option.
  Patch RG*1*43 will remove the SPI action within the MPI/PD
  Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option.
   
  The View Potential Match Patient [RG EXCEPTION POTENTIAL MATCH]
  option is being removed from the Message Exception Menu [RG EXCEPTION
  MENU], as it is now obsolete.

  After choosing a patient at the 'Select Exception' prompt, the
  following choices are displayed at the bottom on the List Manager
  screen.

  Select Action:Quit//
   
      SPI Single Patient Init is removed.
      PMR Potential Match Rev (described below in 'Issue #4') is added.
   
  Issue #3 - Modify MPI/PD Exception Handling.
  Within the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  the MPI/PD Exception Purge [RG EXCEPTION PURGE] option, and related
  sorts and reports, the code was modified to no longer mark the Potential
  Matches Returned exceptions (#218) as processed when the patient has
  a national ICN.
   
  Issue #4 - New Action on MPI/PD Exception Handling option.
  If a patient is presented to the MPI and there is not an exact match
  but there is a potential match, the patient will be added to the MPI
  and a Potential Matches Returned exception will occur on the local VistA
  site.  The user can use a new action, Potential Match Rev [PMR], to
  review the potential match exception.  This action is only available
  for Potential Matches Returned exceptions that are not marked as
  processed.
   
  The Potential Match Rev action will trigger a query to the MPI and
  present any potential matches to the user.  The user can resolve
  a duplicate on the MPI if one exists for the patient being processed.
  The Potential Match Review process gives the user the same capability
  as the Single Patient Initialization action did, except for the ability
  to add.  That is no longer needed as the patient has already been added
  to the MPI.  The user will not see the ICN currently assigned to their
  patient in the list of potential matches.  They will only see other 
  potential matches.  If there is not a match to be made, the user should
  quit and mark the exception as processed.  If they are not sure if there
  is a match or not, the exception should remain in a NOT PROCESSED
  status.  If the exception is marked as processed, it will be removed
  from the list of active exceptions.  If the user is presented with more
  than one match that is the same patient, the IMDQ team should be
  contacted to assist in the resolution of more than one duplicate on the
  MPI.  The user will only be able to match with one entry on the MPI.
  Since the patient has already been added to the MPI, there will not be a 
  local ICN for this patient as there has been in the past.  The only way 
  to know that there is a potential match to be reviewed, at this point, is
  this exception.
   
  A new protocol as been created to support this change in the Exception
  Handler:  RG EXCPT POT MATCH
   
  Issue #5 - Exception Totals Correction
  A remote query on the Austin MPI provides exception statistics to the
  IMDQ staff in their Exception Totals Report [MPI DATA MGT EXC TOTS REP].
  The VistA code in RGMTETOT, that provides this information, previously
  was only counting a 'Potential Matches Returned' exception if it had
  a local or no ICN.  This project changes the ICN Assignment Process,
  so the above logic needed to be revised.
