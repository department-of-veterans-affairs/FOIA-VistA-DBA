Description: 
============

  
 NOIS: WCO-0300-50643
       XWBTCPC
   Under Cache 3.2 error trapping conditions, the return of control wouldn't go 
   to the correct routine, resulting in a run-away job. Fixed by being explicit 
   about the routine to return to.
                         
   When a READ or WRITE error occurs, the error trap code was trying to send 
   an error message to the client. This caused an error, which resulted in a 
   second error being logged.
                         
   The calls to RTL were remove from logging the broker code. If Response Time 
   Logging is on, then the RPC will still be logged.
  
   Worked with the NVS to use the correct call to see that Broker connection
   got registered as client server so they all connections from one IP address
   could share Cache one licenses.
   
   A change was made to check the IP address of the PEER and to use that if
   different than the IP address in the header.  This allows the use of NAT
   translation.

    If an application Newed the XWBOS variable and then experienced an error,
    it would cause a second error in the error module of the Broker.  This 
    has been fixed by setting the value of XWBOS in the error trap module.
  
 NOIS: KAN-0201-40992
       XWBTCPL
    If a connection was made to the RPC Broker listener port that failed to 
    send the correct information, this could cause the listener to fail to 
    detect other connection requests.  This has been fixed by changing the 
    timeout on the read and resetting the port if this happens.

 =========================================================================
 Installation:
  
    1.  During the installation, do not run any RPC-Broker-based Client/Server
        software (e.g., CPRS, PCMM, BCMA).  No Broker-based client/server 
        software should be running while installing this patch on the 
        server.  You can identify these jobs by checking the system status 
        and verifying if any XWBTCPC routines are running (i.e., Broker 
        Handler).  If you find any of these jobs running on the system,  
        notify users to logoff or FORCEX the jobs.  Active users may get 
        NOSOURCE or CLOBBER errors.  
  
    2.  Stop the Broker Listener on the server.  Do this by first 
        checking the system status, then verifying if the XWBTCPL 
        routine is running (i.e., Broker Listener).  If you find this 
        routine running on your system, STOP IT.  To stop the Broker 
        Listener, do the following: 
  
            a.  Log into your M server.                   
            b.  Enter the following command at the M prompt: 
  
                >D STOP^XWBTCP(Listener port) 
                (Typically, the Listener port is 9200) 
  
    3.  Stop any users that are using Broker applications. This applies
        to any job in XWBTCPC or in CPRS.
        
    4.  Broker routines are not usually mapped on systems that allow mapping.
        So, you will probably not have to disable mapping.
  
    5.  Use the Kernel Option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' located on the 
        PackMan menu. This option will load the KIDS package onto your 
        system.
  
    6.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. Now you need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
  
    7.  On the KIDS Installation menu, use the option Install Package(s).
        Respond to the prompts as follows:
        
        Select INSTALL NAME:  XWB*1.1*16
                              ==========
                              
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//
                               
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
  
    8.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 3, the mapped set
        should be rebuilt once the installation has run to completion. 
  
    9.  Restart the Broker Listener on the Server:
          a.  Log into your M server
          b.  Enter the following at the M prompt:
  
              >D STRT^XWBTCP(Listener port)
              (Typically, the Listener port is 9200)
