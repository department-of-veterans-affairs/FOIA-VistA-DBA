 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 Problem:
 ========
   Patch DG*5.3*530 attempted to fix the problem raised by ATG-0803-31354
 for empty PTF transmissions.  This occured whenever the first patient
 record in a transmission exceeded the maximum number of lines allowed in
 transmissions to the Austin Automation Center.  The fix introduced by
 DG*5.3*530 did not fix this problem.  Instead it caused the last 
 patient record in a transmission to be dropped if the message exceeded
 the maximum number of lines. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
   The routine DGPTFTR that existed prior to the install of DG*5.3*530
 is being restored.  (The problem raised by ATG-0803-31354 will be 
 addressed in a future patch).

 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.

         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
