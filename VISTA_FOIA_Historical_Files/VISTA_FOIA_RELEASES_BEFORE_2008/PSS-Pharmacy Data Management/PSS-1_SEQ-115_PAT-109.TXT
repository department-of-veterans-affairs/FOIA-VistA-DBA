Subject: ADD NEW FIELD FOR ORDER FLAG COMMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 During testing of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) project 
 BCMA-HSC Phase III, an issue was discovered with the order flag comments 
 for unit dose orders. There is not enough space to store the entire 
 comment, so the text is truncated. This patch corrects this problem for 
 BCMA by storing the most recent text in an additional location. The 
 comment will still be stored in the current location. It will also be in 
 the MOST RECENT FLAG COMMENT field (#129) of the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file
 (#53.1) which is exported in Inpatient Medications patch PSJ*5*173. For
 active unit dose orders, it will be stored in the MOST RECENT FLAG COMMENT
 field (#128) of the UNIT DOSE sub-file (#55.06) of the PHARMACY PATIENT
 file (#55) which is exported in this patch.
