 This patch updates routine LRUMD to only include patients in the 
 requested sorting group when printing the data by test list.
  
  
 Problem:
 =======
 The problem arises when a patient list is defined and that list has
 sorting groups.  When the option to print by test list is selected and
 a sorting group is selected, all patients that satisfy the test list
 requirement show up on the list regardless of their sorting group. This
 problem does not occur when the option to print by patient list is
 selected.
  
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Modify routine LRUMD to always check for the sorting group whenever one
 is specified in determining which patients to print when printing by
 test list.
