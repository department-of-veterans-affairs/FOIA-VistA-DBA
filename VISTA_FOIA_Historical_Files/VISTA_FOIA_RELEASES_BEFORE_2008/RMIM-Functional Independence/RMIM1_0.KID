The Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) consists of a Delphi form
"BLD",4776,1,2,0)
and associated M routines that provides the ability to enter FIM data
"BLD",4776,1,3,0)
into the FSOD database and CPRS progress notes.  Data is stored in a
"BLD",4776,1,4,0)
local FileMan database for later transmission to the FSOD database in
"BLD",4776,1,5,0)
Austin.
