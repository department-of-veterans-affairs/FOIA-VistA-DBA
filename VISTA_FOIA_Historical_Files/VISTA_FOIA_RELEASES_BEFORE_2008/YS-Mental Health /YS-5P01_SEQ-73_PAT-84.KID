Patch YS*5.01*84 addresses three issues within the Mental Health software.
"BLD",5285,1,8,0)

"BLD",5285,1,9,0)
1. In the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), ITEM NUMBER field (#1), TEXT sub-field 
"BLD",5285,1,10,0)
(#2) for the entry the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI2) a period has 
"BLD",5285,1,11,0)
been added to the end of each response number.  This will allow a reminder
"BLD",5285,1,12,0)
to be built by the Clinical Reminder software.  Here is an example of the
"BLD",5285,1,13,0)
edit made to ITEM NUMBER 2 of the BDI2 instrument using a FILEMAN inquiry:
"BLD",5285,1,14,0)

"BLD",5285,1,15,0)
Before patch:
"BLD",5285,1,16,0)

"BLD",5285,1,17,0)
ITEM NUMBER: 2                          VALID RESPONSE SET: 0123X
"BLD",5285,1,18,0)
 TEXT: PESSIMISM
"BLD",5285,1,19,0)
  
"BLD",5285,1,20,0)
 0 I am not discouraged about my future.
"BLD",5285,1,21,0)
 1 I feel more discouraged about my future than I used to be.
"BLD",5285,1,22,0)
 2 I do not expect things to work out for me.
"BLD",5285,1,23,0)
 3 I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse.
"BLD",5285,1,24,0)

"BLD",5285,1,25,0)

"BLD",5285,1,26,0)

"BLD",5285,1,34,0)

"BLD",5285,1,35,0)

"BLD",5285,1,36,0)
2. In the Mental Health Assistant GUI version 1.0.2.9 when using the mouse 
"BLD",5285,1,37,0)
scroll button in the left-hand pane, the pane freezes at times.  Returning 
"BLD",5285,1,38,0)
to the desktop the mouse arrow suddenly becomes unresponsive to mouse 
"BLD",5285,1,39,0)
movements and begins performing the movements that should have occurred in 
"BLD",5285,1,40,0)
the Mental Health Assistant - in the same area of the screen where the lists 
"BLD",5285,1,41,0)
of tests was.  This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10 to properly navigate 
"BLD",5285,1,42,0)
the large amounts of patient psychological test data users may have.
"BLD",5285,1,43,0)

"BLD",5285,1,44,0)
3. The instrument ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIPS (AOR) has been made
"BLD",5285,1,45,0)
non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the MH INSTRUMENT file
"BLD",5285,1,46,0)
(#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).

"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)

1. In the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), ITEM NUMBER field (#1), TEXT sub-field 
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
(#2) for the entry the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI2) a period has 
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
been added to the end of each response number.  This will allow a reminder
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
to be built by the Clinical Reminder software.  Here is an example of the
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)

2. In the Mental Health Assistant GUI version 1.0.2.9 when using the mouse

"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
to the desktop the mouse arrow suddenly becomes unresponsive to mouse 
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
movements and begins performing the movements that should have occurred in 
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
the Mental Health Assistant - in the same area of the screen where the lists 
"PKG",19,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
of tests was.  This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10 to properly navigate
