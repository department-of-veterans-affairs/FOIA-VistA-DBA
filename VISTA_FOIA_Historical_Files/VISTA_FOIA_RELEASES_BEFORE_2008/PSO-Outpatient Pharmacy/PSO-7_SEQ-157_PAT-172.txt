  1. LEX-0303-42244 & CTX-0504-70229
     While finishing a prescription using the Patient Prescription
     Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] for a controlled
     substance the number of refills could be set to eleven instead
     the maximum allowed, which is five.  This patch will resolve this
     problem.
     
  2. HOU-0404-71083
     When transmitting an HL7 message to the external interface such as
     the Optifill machine, the possibility exists that a line of text with
     only a <null> character could be included in the NTE|2| segment. This
     caused the external interface to reject the message.
     To solve this problem, every blank line with only a <null> character 
     in the NTE|2| segment will have a <space> character added to the 
     beginning of the line. This way, no lines with only a <null> 
     character will be included in the NTE|2| segment.
 
  3. CLE-0404-40219
     When a pharmacist finishes an order using the Patient Prescription
     Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] for a patient and does
     not exit back to the menu prompt, the possibility exists that the
     patients order could still be locked.  This would prevent other
     pharmacists from accessing this order until the original pharmacist
     exits back to the menu prompt.  This patch will resolve this
     problem.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  
 ************************* NOTE *************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS
 software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not
 cause any problems.
 ********************************************************
  
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
 
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*172) 
  
        a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
            the components of the KIDS build.
        c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*172.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
