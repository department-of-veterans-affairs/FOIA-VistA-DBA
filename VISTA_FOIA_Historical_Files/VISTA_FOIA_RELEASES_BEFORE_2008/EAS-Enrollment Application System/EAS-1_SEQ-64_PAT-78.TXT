Description:
============

 NOTE: The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) will install Patch IVMB*2.0*905
 2007 MT/GMT/RX THRESHOLDS before January 1, 2007.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2006-064 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2007. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch (together with 
 DG*5.3*734 2007 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS and IB*2.0*362 2007 RX COPAY
 THRESHOLDS) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to other

 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Income Year 2006 provided 
 in VHA DIRECTIVE 2006-064, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST 
 THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2007 are distributed with this patch. The

 determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year, based 
 on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development. This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based 
 income limits for FY 2006 can be found at:
 http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/pubs/GMTIncomeThresholds/
