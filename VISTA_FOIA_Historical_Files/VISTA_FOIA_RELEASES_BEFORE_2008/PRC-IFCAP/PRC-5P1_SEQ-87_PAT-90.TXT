Subject: FIX DISPLAY/PRINT 1358 PROBLEM /FIX RUNNING BALANCE LAYOUT ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects two IFCAP issues.  
  
 1.  Fix the inability of the Display/Print 1358 option to find an 
 obligation number when the user had previously used this option and then
 backed completely out.
  
 2.  Fix print issues for the Running Balances report.  A blank page
 precedes the printing of the report and the page number is wrapping to 
 the next line.
  
       
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1.  HD106615 - Display/Print 1358 loses pointer to obligation.
 2.  HD113095 - A blank page precedes each report.  The page number wraps.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1.  HD106615 - Display/Print 1358 loses pointer to obligation.
      
 Problem:
 -------
 When a user runs the Display/Print 1358 option, selects an obligation 
 number, runs the report and then answers NO to the question, "Do you 
 wish to print another 1358? ", they exit the option.  After exiting, if
 they decide to go back into the option and enter a different obligation
 number than the previous one entered, the option will indicate it cannot
 be found by displaying ?? after the user hits the enter key.  This is
 occurring even when the user enters a valid obligation number.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A variable that holds a pointer to the original obligation that was 
 entered by the user is not killed prior to leaving the option the first 
 time, causing the error.  This variable will be killed before leaving the 
 option.

 2.  HD113095 - A blank page precedes each report.  The page number wraps.
  
 Problem:
 -------           
 When running the option Running Balances two issues have arisen.  First 
 the report displays an extra blank page before each report.  The second 
 because of the placement of the word 'PAGE', the page number wraps on 
 printouts.  When running this option to your screen you will not notice 
 the problem, but when queued to a printer it shows up.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------- 
 Changes were made to the report to remove the extra page and adjust the 
 layout of the page number.  The change to the page number will stop the 
 number from wrapping to the next line on printout.
