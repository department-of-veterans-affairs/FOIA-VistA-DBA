Subject: REMOVE SSN DISPLAY ON PAID ETA

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 In order to better protect the personally identifiable information of VA
 employees, this patch will modify the screen display of employee Social
 Security Numbers (SSN) on a large percentage of the options throughout
 VistA PAID.
  
 Employee options that display the SSN will be screened to display only the
 last four digits.
  
 Timekeeper and T&A Supervisor options will screen the SSN to display the
 first digit and the last four in order to enable these personnel to
 differentiate between real SSN and pseudo-SSN.
  
 Payroll and Human Resources options will continue to display the entire SSN.
  
 In some cases, the VistA PAID application presents a list of employees
 with full SSN from which to make a selection. This selection list will
 continue to display the full SSN. Only option display screens will be
 modified by this patch.
  
  
 NOTE: Due to a software conflict, the Nurse Alternate Work Schedules
       patch, PRS*4.0*112, will update the SSN display for the following
       options:
  
            Display Leave Requests       [PRSA LV DISP]
            Pay Period Certification     [PRSA SUP REV]
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20060606   Remove the display of SSN in the employee T A display
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
