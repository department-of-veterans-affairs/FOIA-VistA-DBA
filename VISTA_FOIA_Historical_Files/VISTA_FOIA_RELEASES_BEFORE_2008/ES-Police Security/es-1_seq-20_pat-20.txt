Description: 
============

   This patch to POLICE & SECURITY v1.0 addresses software modifications to
   ensure full compliance with VistA Y2K renovation policy.  Two routines,
   ESPORM2 and ESPORP2, and the data definition of the AGE field (#.0301)
   in the ESP MASTER NAME INDEX File (#910) have been modified.
   
   The following Police & Security options are affected:
   
   Print Any Offense Report            [ESP PRINT ANY OR]
   Transmit An Offense Report          [ESP TRANSMIT OR]
   
   The modifications were made so that the translation of date of birth
   data into age is done using the approved logic.  The user will not notice
   any difference in the data output.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*20):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*20.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
      
            Print Any Offense Report       [ESP PRINT ANY OR]
            Transmit An Offense Report     [ESP TRANSMIT OR]
            
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
