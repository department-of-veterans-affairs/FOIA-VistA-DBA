Subject: REMOTE INSURANCE QUERY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 VA facilities and/or VISNs have separate patient and insurance databases. 
 This enhancement will allow sites to exchange insurance information
 through the use of Remote Data Views.  There are 3 main features included
 in this enhancement.
  
 Feature 1.  Users will have a new menu option called "Remote Insurance 
 Query [IBCN REMOTE INSURANCE QUERY]" on the "Patient Insurance Menu [IBCN
 INSURANCE MGMT MENU]" menu.  This new option will allow users to select a
 patient and  if the patient has remote facilities a query will be
 performed to those remote facilities looking for insurance information.  
 Any insurance information found will be automatically loaded into the
 insurance buffer file of the requesting facility for verification.
  
 Feature 2.  A remote insurance query will be automatically performed when 
 the nightly claims tracking process runs if the following are true: 
 inpatient claims tracking is turned on, the patient has a scheduled 
 admission and the patient does not have reimbursable insurance on file.  
 If insurance information is found from the query, it will be automatically
 loaded into the insurance buffer file for Verification and a claims
 tracking entry will be added.  To avoid MEDICARE duplicates, the software
 will look for MEDICARE (WNR) and if that insurance is already on file that
 information will not be captured again.
  
 Features 3.  When a patient is admitted a remote insurance query will be 
 automatically performed if the following are true: if the admission 
 tracking part of claims tracking is set to FOR INSURED AND UR ONLY and if
 the patient does not have reimbursable insurance on file.  If insurance
 information is found from the query, it will automatically be loaded into
 the insurance buffer file for verification and an admissions claims
 tracking entry will be added.  To avoid MEDICARE duplicates, the software
 will look for MEDICARE (WNR) and if that insurance company is already on
 file, that information will not be captured again.
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 This patch contains 3 routines.  The main routine for process all new 
 functionality is contained in the routine IBCNRDV.  The other 2 routines 
 (IBTRKR and IBTRKR2) are used for hooks into the scheduled admissions and 
 the admission event part of the claims tracking module.
  
 Also included in this patch is a new option "Remote Insurance Query [IBCN 
 REMOTE INSURANCE QUERY]" that is on the "Patient Insurance Menu [IBCN 
 INSURANCE MGMT MENU]" menu and 2 Remote Procedure calls.
  
 This enhancement will make use of Remote Data Views (RDV) to exchange 
 information between facilities.
