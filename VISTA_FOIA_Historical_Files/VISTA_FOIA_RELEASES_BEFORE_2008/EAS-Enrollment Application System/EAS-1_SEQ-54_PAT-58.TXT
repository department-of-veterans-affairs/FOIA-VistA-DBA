Subject: REMOVE INVALID ENTRIES FROM EAS MT LETTER FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 PURPOSE OF THE PATCH
 ====================
  
 Some sites may have up to 2 invalid entries in their EAS MT Letter file
 (713.3).  These are entries for 20 and 40 day letters, which are not
 used.  However, these entries could still be selected from a pick list.
  
 The purpose of the patch is to remove these entries, where they exist,
 so that they may no longer be selected.
  
  
 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 This patch just contains one routine, a post-install routine, EAS1A58.
  
  
 Issue I - Remove invalid entries
 ================================
  
 The post-install routine will check for invalid entries, and remove them
 if any exist.
  
 Possible invalid entries in the EAS MT Letters file (713.3):
  
 - 20-DAY LETTER
 - 40-DAY LETTER
  
 *** NOTE ***
  
 The following message will be displayed on the screen, and may scroll
 off quickly.  In order to verify the message, please refer to the
 screen print of the install. 
  
 ************
  
 In most cases, no invalid entries will be found, and the following
 message will be displayed:
  
 > This patch checked the EAS MT Letter File (713.3)      <
 > for the existence of entries for 20 and 40 day letters <
  
 > No such entries were found.  No action was necessary.  <
  
  
  
 At several sites, invalid entries may be found.  If so, the
 following message, for example, will be displayed:
  
 > This patch checked the EAS MT Letter File (713.3)      <
 > for the existence of entries for 20 and 40 day letters <
  
 > 2 entries were removed.  The process is complete.      <

    Problem: This NOIS/Remedy addresses a number of problems, including
             the existence of invalid entries in the EAS MT Letters
             file at a small number of sites.
  
             The possible invalid entries are:
  
             - 20-DAY LETTER

 Resolution: The post-install routine will remove the entries if they
             exist.  In either case, a message will be displayed
             stating that either no invalid entries were found or
             that invalid entries were removed.
