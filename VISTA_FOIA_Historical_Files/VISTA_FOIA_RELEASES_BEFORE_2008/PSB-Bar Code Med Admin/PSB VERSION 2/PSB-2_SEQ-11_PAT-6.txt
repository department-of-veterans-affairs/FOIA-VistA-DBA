  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 ***NOTE*** Do NOT install this patch until you receive the message
 "BCMA AADT X-REF CHECK COMPLETED" from the installation of PSB*2.0*9 and
 the message "BCMA Order Problem Notification Finished" from the 
 installation of PSB*2.0*18. Installing this patch before receiving these 
 messages may cause the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) program 
 to error.
 
 This patch contains changes to how BCMA V. 2.0 processes schedule
 information from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, and how it determines 
 when to display a Continuous medication order on 
 the Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
 At the end of this installation a post install routine will clean up the 
 BCMA APATCH index. The person installing the patch will be notified that 
 the routine has completed successfully via a MailMan message with the 
 following subject line "BCMA APATCH INDEX CLEAN HAS COMPLETED".
 
 1.  Problem: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option 
     displays medication orders beyond the requested report dates.
  
     Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
     option now displays medication orders within the requested report 
     dates.
  
 2.  Problem: When a patient is discharged and reinstated, the MAH 
     displays "***" in the date column.
  
     Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
     option has been modified to not display "***" in the Date
     column for medication orders that have been discontinued and
     then reinstated.   
  
 3.  Problem: PRN last actions listed as "Not Given" display on the
     Medication Log Information dialog box.
  
     Corrective Action: The last four actions of a PRN medication order
     will not display an action of "Not Given", in the Medication Log
     Information dialog box.
 
 4.  Problem: A medication order for a Patch displayed multiple 
     times on the VDL, if it was marked as "Given", then "Not Given"
     and then "Given" again.
     
     Corrective Action: A medication order for a Patch will display 
     appropriately, regardless of how many times an action has been 
     applied to the associated patch order.
 
 5.  Problem: After a patient receives a patch for the second time 
     the "Last Action" column on the VDL displays the incorrect date and time.
 
     Corrective Action: The "Last Action" column will now display the correct
     date and time for patches. 
 
 6.  Problem: When an active IV order that has an infusing bag is edited
     through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), via the "CHANGE"
     action, the "old" order disappears from the BCMA VDL IV tab.  
     This prevents clinicians from knowing the status of the old order.
  
     Corrective Action: Continue to display the status of an edited IV order 
     on the BCMA VDL IV tab.    
  
 7.  Problem: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option generates
     a "String too long" error message for medication orders that contain
     a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
  
     Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option now displays
     medication orders that contain a schedule using a minute's format. 
 
 8.  Problem: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option 
     generates a "String too long" error message for medication orders that 
     contains a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
  
     Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
     option now displays medication orders that contain a schedule using a 
     minute's format. However, schedules with a frequency of less than 45 
     minutes will display the message "Due Every # Minutes", where # is the
     frequency.
 
 9.  Problem: Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option generates
     a "String too long" error message for medication orders that contain
     a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
  
     Corrective Action: The Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option 
     now displays medication orders that contain a schedule using a minute's 
     format. However, schedules with a frequency of less than 30 minutes 
     will display the message "Due Every # Minutes", where # is the frequency.
 
 10. Problem: Medication orders that include a Day of the Week schedule 
     generate a false Due List Notification Error on a day not due.
  
     Corrective Action: Medication orders that include a Day of the Week 
     schedule will no longer generate a false Due List Notification Error.
   
 11. Problem: If a medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" is 
     administered by a nurse using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG  
     NEW ENTRY] option, the medication will not display on the VDL for the
     nurse to mark it as "Removed."
  
     Corrective Action: Medication orders with a dosage form of "PATCH"
     given by a nurse using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW
     ENTRY] option will now display on the VDL for the nurse
     to mark them as "Removed." 
  
 12. Problem: The Admin Time column on the IVP/IVPB tab of the VDL is 
     displaying administration times of "0000" for odd schedule orders.
  
     Corrective Action: The Admin Time column on the IVP/IVPB tab of
     VDL will now display the correct time for an odd schedule order. 
  
 13. Problem: The data entered in the "Enter Quantity and Units" dialogue 
     box from the IVP/PB tab was not being stored in the medication log.
  
     Corrective Action: The data is now being properly stored in the
     medication log.
  
 14. Problem: If a medication order is marked as "Not Given", the user is 
     unable to update the medication using the Manual Medication Entry 
     [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.
  
     Corrective Action: The user will now be able to update medication
     orders that have been marked as "Not Given" using the Manual Medication
     Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option. 
 
 15. Problem: If a PRN medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" was 
     marked as "Given", it would duplicate on the VDL. The user was unable 
     to mark the medication as "Removed."
  
     Corrective Action: PRN medication orders with the dosage form of
     "PATCH" will follow the "PATCH" business rule.
  
 16. Problem: The Ward Administration Times report displays IV orders with 
     admin times based on the frequency calculated by IPM. The display of 
     large volume IV's on this report is confusing to the user.
  
     Corrective Action: IV's with a IV type of Admixture, Hyperal, Syringe 
     Not Intermittent, Chemotherapy (Admixture), Chemotherapy (Syringe 
     Non-Intermittent) will not be displayed on this report.
 
 17. Problem: A Schedule Type of "R" displays in the "Type" column on the 
     VDL for medication orders that have a dosage form of "PATCH" and 
     a previous Schedule Type of Fill on Request. 
  
     Corrective Action:  The correct Schedule Type will display in the 
     "Type" column on the VDL.
 
 18. Problem:  A condition exists that causes a medication order to have
     the same previous and following order number.
     Because of this scenario, the BCMA application is put into an 
     infinite loop or may cause an error when the VDL is opened.
  
     Corrective Action:  In support of several NOIS tickets regarding this 
     issue, BCMA has implemented a temporary fix that now allows a medication
     order with the same previous and following order number to display on the
     VDL. This is not a comprehensive fix, but will allow BCMA to function 
     properly while Inpatient Meds researches the problem.
 
 19. Problem:  A one-time medication order marked as "Missing," 
     would not display on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
  
     Corrective Action:  A one-time medication order marked as "Missing,"
     will now display on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.  
 
 20. Problem: Day of the Week schedules that include the "@" sign followed 
     by a valid time do not display on the Virtual Due List.
  
     Corrective Action: Day of the Week schedules in this format now
     display correctly on the Virtual Due List.
