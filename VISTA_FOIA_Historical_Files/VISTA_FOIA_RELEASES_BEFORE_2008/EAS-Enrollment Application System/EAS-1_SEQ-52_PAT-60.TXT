Subject: UPDATE ENROLLMENT APPLICATION SYSTEM(EAS) SYSTEM GENERATED 10-10EZ FORM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  
 Issue #1 - Reformat 1010EZ Form Printed from VistA:
 ===================================================
 The existing web generated VA Form 10-10EZ, dated JUN 2004 has been
 reformatted and is now superseded with OMB Approved VA Form 10-10EZ,
 dated NOV 2004.
  
 This patch will synchronize the EAS system generated 10-10EZ form with
 the web generated OMB Approved VA Form 10-10EZ, dated NOV 2004.  All
 10-10EZ data elements are consistent between both forms.  Due to lack of
 real estate some of the field numbers within the EAS system generated
 form are not consistent with the field numbers on the web generated
 10-10EZ form, but the fields have been placed within very close proximity
 of each other.
  
 Issue #2 - Correct Printing  Zeroes in Fields with a NULL Value:
 ================================================================
  
 The 10-10EZ is printing zeros in all the income fields when the veteran
 declined to give financial information. There are also zeros in the spouse
 and children's income when the veteran does not have any dependents.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
  
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
  
 MAD-0904-40895    ELECTRONIC 10-10EZ
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------
  
       NOIS: MAD-0904-40895 - ELECTRONIC 10-10EZ
  
    Problem: The 10-10EZ is printing zeros in all the income fields and in
             the spouse and children's income when the veteran does not
             have any dependents and declines to give financial
             information.
  
 Resolution: The EAS 10-10EZ print routines have been modified to leave
             the fields with a NULL value blank, if veteran declines to
             give financial information and does not have any dependents.
