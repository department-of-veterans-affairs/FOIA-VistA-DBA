 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. SDC-1003-60397  EVENT CAPTURE SUMMARY REPORT
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The user reported in the past when running the Provider Summary 
    Report in Event Capture the report would give a list of CPT codes 
    used with a total count. The user tried running the report and now 
    there is no summary. The report lists each CPT code, the description, 
    and then a volume figure. It does not give the total volume figure 
    for the CPT codes. 
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changes were made to ECPROV3 routine to correct the Provider 
    Summary Report from displaying the same CPT code per Location and 
    DSS Unit. The routine will provide the total count of all related 
    CPT codes per Location and DSS Unit.
    
 2. ATG-1003-32545  Prov Sum Rpt - No DSS Unit subheader if no workload
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When the user runs the Provider Summary Report in Event Capture for 
    a particular DSS unit and that DSS unit has no workload during the 
    specified period, only the Location subheader appears on the report, 
    along with a message indicating "no workload". The DSS Unit subheader 
    does not appear on the report in this case, so the user doesn't know 
    which DSS unit the report was for.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ECPROV3 was changed to allow the DSS Unit Name to be 
    displayed for each workload even if there is no workload for that 
    particular DSS Unit.
    
 3. ANN-1003-42305  Site showing incorrect in Provider Summary Report
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When the user ran the Provider Summary Report in the Event Capture 
    GUI, the location for the Toledo Outpatient Clinic showed up as 
    Navy. The user ran the same report in List Manager and it came up 
    correctly. 
       
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The problem has to do with the Fileman lookup done at ECPROV^ECRRPT. 
    DIC(0) allows for multiple cross reference use. The "M" will be 
    removed from DIC(0) to correct the problem.

     Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
     
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
    
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.

        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*56)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

        ECX*2.0*56.
