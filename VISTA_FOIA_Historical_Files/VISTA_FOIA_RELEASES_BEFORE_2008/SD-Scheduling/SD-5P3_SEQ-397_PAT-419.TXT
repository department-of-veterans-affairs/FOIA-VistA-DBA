Description:
============

 This patch introduces several new EWL reports. The new reports are 
 tailored to the recent updates to the EWL software. There are a total of 
 5 new reports, including 2 AD HOC reports tools to produce customized 
 reports. The reports are attached to the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Reports menu
 [SD WAIT LIST REPORTS MENU]. Below is a brief description of each reports.
  
  Ad Hoc Report V1: 
      This report allows the user to complete a Fileman Print from the SD
      Wait List file.  This option will be useful to EWL clerks and first
      line supervisors for brief report generation without the need for
      complete Fileman access.
  
  Ad Hoc Report V2: 
      This reports allows the user to complete a Fileman Search from the SD
      Wait List file. This option will be useful to EWL clerks and first
      line Supervisors for brief report generation without the need for
      complete Fileman access.
  
  EWL 30 Day Report:
      This report provides a list of patients whose Desired Date for an
      appointment is within 30 days or less.  The report is sorted by
      Institution, and then by the Desired Date for the appointment.
      It displays the patient's name, the last 4 of the patient's Social
      Security Number, the Desired Date, the Originating Date and the
      Clinic or Specialty Wait List.  This report is useful for identifying
      those patients who need immediate follow up regarding their being
      served within 30 day of their desired appointment date.
  
  EWL Non-Removal Reason Report:
      This report lists patients who were on a Wait List for a particular
      Clinic or Specialty and were not removed from the Wait List when an
      appointment was made for that Clinic or Specialty.  The report
      displays the patient's name and the last 4 of the patient's Social
      Security Number along with the Originating Date, Non-Removal Date
      and Non-Removal Reason.  The user's name and EWL record Status is
      also included.
  
  EWL Wait Time Statistics Report: 
      This report provides a number of wait time statistics for each 
      patient listed in the report.  Stats include the number of days
      elapsed from the Originating Date to the Scheduled Date of
      Appointment, from the Originating Date to the Desired Date of
      Appointment, from the Scheduled Date of Appointment to the Desired
      Date of Appointment, from the Originating Date to the Date of
      Disposition, and from the Originating Date to the actual Date the
      appointment was made.
