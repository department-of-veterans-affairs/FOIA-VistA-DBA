Description:
============

 This patch, DG*5.3*694, follows up on released patch XU*8.0*378 STATE &
 FOREIGN COUNTRY CLEAN UP by implementing the new report option 'Invalid
 State/Inactive County Report' [DG INVALID STATE/COUNTY REPORT] in the
 Registration application. Drawing on data from the PATIENT (#2) and STATE
 (#5) files, this report lists patient records whose address fields contain
 invalid states and/or inactive counties. The user may run the report for
 1) US and US Possessions Only, 2) Foreign Addresses Only, or 3) Both.  
  
 NOTE:  Because this report is expected to take a long time to generate, 
 it is recommended that you queue it to print at a later time.
  
 Here is a sample output from the report, which utilizes report criteria
 option 3) Both. ('AAC' stands for Austin Automation Center.)

 Total records reported: 3
  
  
 A state is considered invalid and will appear on the report if the AAC
 RECOGNIZED field (#2.1) in the STATE file (#5) is set to 'No' or the
 first character of the state name is 'Z'.
  
 A county is considered inactive and will appear on the report if it has
 a date in the INACTIVE DATE field (#5) in the COUNTY sub-file (#5.01) of 
 the STATE file (#5), or the county is in a state which is not recognized
 by the AAC (field #2.1 AAC RECOGNIZED in the STATE file (#5) is set to
 'No'.)
  
 An address is considered a US or US Possession if the US STATE OR
 POSSESSION field (#2.2) in the STATE file (#5) is set to 'Yes'.
  
 An address is considered foreign if the US STATE OR POSSESSION field 
 (#2.2) is set to 'No' or blank.
 NOTE:  even if the address is considered foreign, it will appear on the 
 report only if the AAC RECOGNIZED field (#2.1) in the STATE file (#5) is 
 set to 'No' or blank.
  
 NOTE:  If you run the report for the purpose of resolving the
 discrepancies it will display, be sure to use the appropriate resources to
 verify the correctness of the changes you wish to make. Edit the 
 appropriate fields in the PATIENT file (#2) only, using the Load/Edit 
 Patient Data option on the Registration Menu.
  
 PATIENT file (#2) fields reported at your site as containing incorrect
 state data should be edited only to states recognized by the AAC (see list
 below). PATIENT file (#2) fields reported as containing inactive counties
 should be edited only to counties that have no inactive date and are
 located in states that are recognized by the AAC.
  
 Once your site has installed both associated Kernel patch XU*8*378 and 
 this patch (DG*5.3*694), you may run the new report option. You will be
 able to use entries from the table below to replace incorrect PATIENT file
 (#2) state field entries appearing on your report with the correct
 entries.
