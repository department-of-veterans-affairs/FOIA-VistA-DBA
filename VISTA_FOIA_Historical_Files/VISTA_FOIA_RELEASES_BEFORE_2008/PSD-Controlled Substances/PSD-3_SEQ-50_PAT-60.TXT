Subject: DRUG LOOKUP RETURNS INCORRECT GREENSHEET

 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ====================
 HD0000000090355   Bar code identification problem
  Duplicates:
    HD0000000122771   Refer: HD0000000068251
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported that when Nursing scans/signs out a dose to a patient
 using Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DISPENSING] option, the lookup
 returns the drug that was assigned to a greensheet that matches the drug
 where the drug's IEN overlaps with old greensheet numbers.
  
 Other options that use the same lookup:
 Record Defective Dose [PSD NURSE DEFECTIVE DOSE]
 Not Given, Return to Stock [PSD NURSE NOT GIVEN]
 Delayed Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DELAYED DISPENSE]
 Record Delayed Wastage [PSD NURSE WASTE]
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To correct this problem, the routines called by the options listed in the
 problem section will be modified to check the DATE/TIME (#3) field of the
 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION (#58.81) file.  If the date of the
 greensheet is more than a year old, the value in the DRUG (#4) field of
 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION (#58.81) file will be checked against the
 value scanned in.  If those values do not match, the DRUG (#50) file will
 be checked for a match to the value scanned in.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 PSDRF, PSDRF4, PSDRFR, PSDRFS and PSDRFW will be modified to populate
 the PSDR variable with the value scanned in if:
 1) PSDR variable is populated, 
 2) PSDR variable does not equal the value scanned in,
 3) the value of the DATE/TIME (#3) field of DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
    TRANSACTION (#58.81) file is more than a year old,
 4) the value scanned in exists in the DRUG (#50) file, and
 5) that value also exists in the DRUG (#10) field of the DRUG 
    ACCOUNTABILITY STATS (#58.8) file.
 If all the conditions listed are true, the PSDR variable will be
 set equal to the value scanned in.
