Description:
============

  This patch contains the fixes to problems reported in Remedy Tickets that
  involve the Lexicon or Code Set Versioned data.  Unlike many Lexicon and Code
  Set updates, this patch does not include a Global Host file or a Kernel
  Distribution Host file.  The changes are fully contained in Post-Install 
  routines of the installable Packman message from the National Patch Module.
 
     This patch writes to the following files:
   
       CPT/HCPCS Procedure       #81         ^ICPT(         DBIA  4489
