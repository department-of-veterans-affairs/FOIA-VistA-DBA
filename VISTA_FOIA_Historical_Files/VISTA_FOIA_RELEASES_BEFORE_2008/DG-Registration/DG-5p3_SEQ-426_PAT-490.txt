Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*456  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*490'

Subject: GMT THRESHOLDS UNDEFINED ERRORS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 Developed in MNT,VMM
 ====================
  
 The patch addresses the following NOIS issues:
 =============================================
     BOI-1202-51611 - Errors after loading Patch IVM*2*62
     UNY-1202-11418 - DIS+15^DGMTSC4 errors after DG*5.3*456 install
     WRJ-1202-11693 - view a means test
  
  
 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 ====================
 The problem occurs when using one of the following options:
   DG MEANS TEST ADD               Add a New Means Test
   DG MEANS TEST EDIT              Edit an Existing Means Test
   DG MEANS TEST VIEW TEST         View a Past Means Test
  
 When the following criteria is met the following errors can occur:
    ERRORS:
     <UNDEFINED> at line DIS+15^DGMTSC4
     <UNDEFINED> at line ADJ+4^DGMTSCC 
  
    CRITERIA:
     * The veteran's income is below the MT threshold.
     * The veteran's assets are above the net worth threshold.
     * The means test date is prior to the GMT COPAY REQUIRED
       means test status effective date (JAN 01, 2002).
  
 The undefined variable is DGTHG, which stores the GMT threshold.
 To resolve this issue, a line of code was added to the API CAT^DGMTSCU2
 to always set the variable DGTHG to a NULL value prior to calculating
 the GMT threshold.

   Installation Steps:
   ===================
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.
  
   2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches DG*5.3*490 are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*490).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select DG*5.3*490.
  
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install?
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
   7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
      DG MEANS TEST ADD               Add a New Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST EDIT              Edit an Existing Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST VIEW TEST         View a Past Means Test
      EASEC LTC EXEMPTION TEST EDIT   Edit an Existing LTC Copay Exemption Test
      EASEC LTC EXEMPTION TEST VIEW   LTC Copay Exemption Test View
  
   8. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
