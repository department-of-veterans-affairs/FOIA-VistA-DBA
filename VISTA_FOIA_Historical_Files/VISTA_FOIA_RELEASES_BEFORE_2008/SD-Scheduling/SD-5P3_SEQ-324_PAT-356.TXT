Subject: PRE-APPOINTMENT LETTER DATES AND CANCEL LETTER PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 problems: 
 1) When printing pre-appointment letters the date prompts should assume a 
 future date if no year is entered.
 2) If an appointment is cancelled due to scheduling a different 
 appointment at the same date/time a cancellation letter is not printed. 
 This patch adds a cancellation letter prompt in this situation.
 
 NOTE: The prompt for the letter print is not displayed if the new 
 appointment is for the same clinic.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 POR-1202-52209  Pre-Appointment letters not showing the correct year
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The date prompt in the Pre-appointment letters does not assume a future 
 date.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Add the Future flag to the FileMan date utility parameter list. Any 
 date entered without a year will be assumed to be in the following year 
 IF that date is passed for the current year.
  
 MON-0404-50903 - SCHEDULING PROBLEM AND PRINTED PATIENT LETTERS
  
 Problem:
 -------
 If the user tries to schedule a Vets appointment for a date/time in which 
 the Vet already has an appointment,the routine will ask if they want to 
 cancel the original appointment. If they say "Yes",then the routine 
 cancels the original and schedules the new appointment. There is now no 
 record of the original appointment and therefore no cancellation letter. 
 Occassionally the Vet will come into the hospital/clinic for the 
 cancelled appointment with his appointment letter in hand - even though 
 that appointment no longer exists.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 If the user hits the above scenario they will be asked if they want to 
 print a cancellation letter right then. It will be their only chance. If 
 they say "Yes" the routine prints the letter and continues on with the 
 appointment changes.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.  Users do not have to be off the system.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still display the patch text
    only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter SD*5.3*356)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*356.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
         SDAM APPT MGT     Appointment Management
         SDPRLETTERS       Print Scheduling Letters
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
