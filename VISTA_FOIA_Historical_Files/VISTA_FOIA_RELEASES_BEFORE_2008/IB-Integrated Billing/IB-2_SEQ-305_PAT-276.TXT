Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*148
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*276
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*90
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*48
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (AR) V. 4.5                      PRCA*4.5*230
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
     
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
 Functional Description of IB modifications:                                     
 ------------------------------------------------------------                    
                                                                                 
 The patch includes four new menu options:                                       
                                                                                 
 ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]                      
 This new option generates a report that captures and displays dataflow          
 between the ECME and IB packages and can be used to resolve potential issues    
 related to electronic claims processing.  The report displays the time and 
 data passed for the following types of ECME-IB interaction events:  FINISH 
 (billable status check on Finish Prescription), SUBMIT, RELEASED, BILLING,      
 CLOSED, and REVERSED.                                                           
                                                                                 
 Generate ECME Rx Bills option [IB GENERATE ECME RX BILLS]                       
 A new option that enables back-billing capability from the IB application.
 It allows the IB user to submit/re-submit any given Rx claim from this new IB   
 option to ECME for claims submission.  If there is an existing non-cancelled    
 bill, it will not submit/re-submit the claim.                                   
                                                                                 
 Group Plan Status Report option [IBCNR PLAN STATUS REPORT] and                  
 Group Plan Status Inquiry option [IBCNR PLAN STATUS INQUIRY]                    
 These 2 new options are attached to the list of options found under the         
 IBCNR E-Pharmacy Menu option [IBCNR E-PHARMACY MENU].  The NCPDP process        
 requires that the users match Group Plans to Pharmacy Plans.  Both the          
 report option and inquiry option will assist users in evaluating                
 GROUP INSURANCE PLAN file (#355.3) entries that have INACTIVE plans or need     
 to be matched to pharmacy plans.                                                
                                                                                 
 Modified IB options                                                             
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     
                                                                                 
 Move Subscribers to a Different Plan option [IBCN MOVE SUBSCRIB TO PLAN]        
 Enhancements were made to this existing option to move a group of patients      
 (i.e. subscribers) from one Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) to another       
 by expiring the old plan instead of the system always deleting it. The         
 modified software will enable the user to delete or expire the old plan         
 from the patient profile.  Specifically, the software applies Effective Date    
 to the 'MOVE SUBSCRIBERS' procedure which has the outcome of the previous      
 insurance remaining in the Patient Profile, but EXPIRES on the assigned         
 Effective Date.  The reason to expire the old plan is intended for use when     
 insurance groups change a PBM for processing electronic pharmacy claims.        
 By leaving the old plan information intact (i.e. do not replace), the user      
 will be able to monitor PBM changes that affect the electronic pharmacy        
 claims. Additionally, members of the Mail Group "IB NEW INSURANCE", will        
 receive a bulletin with the details on the performed procedure, including       
 the list of patients.                                                           
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
 Copy and Cancel option [IB COPY AND CANCEL] and                                 
 Cancel Bill option [IB CANCEL BILL]                                             
 The software supporting these 2 options was modified to prevent the             
 cancellation of an ECME bill if a reversal through the ECME package was not     
 performed.  If the software interprets that the user has not yet performed      
 the ECME reversal on the bill, then a warning message will be displayed to the  
 user that the bill needs to be cancelled by performing a reversal using the     
 ECME package and the process terminates.  If the software interprets the user   
 has performed the reversal through ECME, then the software is mapped to the     
 existing cancellation algorithm.                                                
                                                                                 
 The following enhancements were made to the $$STORESP^IBNCPDP function:         
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------         
                                                                                 
 Added 2 new elements, "CLOSE REASON" and "CLOSE COMMENT", to the INPUT        
 array which supports the CLOSE CLAIM functionality. When the pharmacy           
 user closes an ECME Claim, the Close Reason is being prompted and passed        
 to IB. Depending on the user's response, the respective Claims Tracking         
 (CT) record will be marked as "Billable" or "Non-billable" with a               
 corresponding non-billable reason. When the user closes a claim in the          
 ECME package, he will be able to enter a free text comment to the Comment       
 prompt.  The free text comment is passed to IB from ECME in the "CLOSE          
 COMMENT" array element. The CLOSE COMMENT is stored in the ADDITIONAL           
 COMMENT field (#1.08) and the CLOSE REASON is stored in the REASON NOT          
 BILLABLE field (#.19) of the CLAIMS TRACKING file (#356) respectively.          
                                                                                 
 Added IB support for the automatic release of hold patient's copay              
 charges. When the payer rejects an ECME claim, or a claim is closed             
 by the user, IB will automatically pass the held first party charges to         
 AR.                                                                             
                                                                                 
 IB will not allow ECME to send electronic claims if the AutoBiller              
 already created the bill, unless the AutoBiller bill is cancelled.              
                                                                                 
 Added the new element, "DIVISION", to the INPUT array which contains 
 a pointer value from an entry in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file               
 (#40.8).  This DIVISION value is associated with the facility from              
 which the Rx was filled.                                                        
                                                                                 
 Modified the IB function to return non ECME-billable status if the DEA          
 parameter is not defined.                                                       
                                                                                 
 Modified the IB function to avoid billing problems causing incomplete           
 bills when attempting to create an electronic pharmacy bill for a               
 patient who does not have insurance for the current date.                       
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
 The following changes were done to the CT user screen:                          
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------         
                                                                                 
 Modified the CT user's screen to display the actual NDC number for the          
 prescription. Previously the CT screen displayed the NDC Number from the DRUG   
 file (#50). Now the NDC Number will be pulled from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52)  
 to correctly reflect the user's changes.                                        
                                                                                 
 Added capability to electronically re-submit the prescription associated        
 with the CT record. It is also now possible to submit the Rx electronically     
 if the CT record has the non-billable reason "NEEDS SC DETERMINATION".          
 The patch modified the CLAIMS TRACKING EDIT List Manager screen to add          
 the capability to submit ECME claims from the following menu options:           
                                                                                 
 [IBT EDIT TRACKING ENTRY]     Claims Tracking Edit                              
 [IBT EDIT BI TRACKING ENTRY]  Claims Tracking Edit                              
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
 ^XTMP subscripts - purge routine available                                      
 -------------------------------------------                                     
 A purge routine, ^IBEVNTP, was created that will enable the IRM to remove       
 ^XTMP subscripts that were built by the IB package if space for ^XTMP becomes   
 an issue.  The data at subscripts, "IBNCPDP-"_date, are referenced and          
 reported by the IB ECME Billing Events report generated by the ECME Billing     
 Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]. This purge should only be        
 executed by the IRM and therefore will not be accessible by a Kernel menu       
 option.  The IRM will need to coordinate this purge operation with the          
 appropriate billing/accounts receivable staff to determine how much data        
 should be purged.  Please note that the purge will automatically keep 35        
 consecutive days worth of data from the current date. To invoke the purge,
 the IRM will enter D EN^IBEVNTP at the programmer prompt.                       
                                                                                 
 The ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] will need to     
 be disabled before running the purge.                                           
                                                                                 
 Changes performed by the post-install procedure of the patch:                   
 --------------------------------------------------------------                  
                                                                                 
 1. Edit HIPAA NCPDP FLAG option [IBCNR EDIT HIPAA NCPDP FLAG] is enabled        
 which was distributed by the patch IB*2.0*251, but was placed 'Out of           
 Order'.                                                                         
                                                                                 
 2. Entries in the PLAN file (#366.03) are modified to change the default        
 status of the LOCAL ACTIVE? field (#.03) of the APPLICATION subfile             
 (#366.033) from "Active to "Inactive".  That will impact only plans never       
 edited by the user after installed from the patch IB*2.0*251, and plans         
 last edited by the "HL7" Automated User.  Those plans will need to be           
 activated manually after the HIPAA NCPDP product deliverable is installed.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP IN THE
 EXACT ORDER INDICATED BELOW. ONCE STARTED, THE INSTALLATION NEEDS TO BE
 COMPLETED. FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION (ONCE STARTED) WILL
 LIKELY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR USERS OF THE 6 APPLICATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS 
 PROJECT.
  
 BEFORE PROCEEDING, please read item number 12.2 and make sure you have the
 information needed in order to complete this installation.
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of these patches. These
 patches should be installed during non-peak hours to avoid disruptions.
  
 Installation should take approximately 15 minutes.
   
 Notes: 1. You cannot queue this installation for a later time, because you
           will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
        2. DO NOT install patch PSX*2*48 when prescriptions are being
           transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
           complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        3. For existing test sites, stop the BPS NCPDP logical link.  Turn off
           the logical link using the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option, which
           is on the Filer and Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER
           LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When 
           prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter BPS NCPDP and when 
           asked whether it is "Okay to shut down this job?", enter YES.
  
  
 1.  These patches will be sent to your system upon release from the National
     Patch Module:
     
       - Patch PSS*1*90

       - Patch PRCA*4.5*230
  
     Obtain the host file ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID, which contains the following
     three KIDS build distributions:
       
         PSO*7.0*148
         BPS*1.0*1
         IB*2.0*276
  
 Sites may retrieve the host file in one of the following ways:
  
  1.1 The preferred method is to FTP the file from download.vista.med.va.gov,
     which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
  
  1.2 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov

     3.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     3.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     3.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
