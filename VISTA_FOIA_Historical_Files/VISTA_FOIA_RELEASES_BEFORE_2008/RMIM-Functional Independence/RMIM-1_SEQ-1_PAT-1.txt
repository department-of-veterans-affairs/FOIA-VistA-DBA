Subject: FIM GUI UPDATE 1

Category: 
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 RMIM*1*1 is the first patch for the FIM (Functional Independence 
 Measurement) Graphical User Interface (GUI).  This patch provides an 
 executable that is used in conjunction with the kids build to provide the 
 user with a gui environment that must be installed on the clients machine 
 or as a shortcut for the user that executes the application on a server.  
 No routines are being shipped with this patch, however the users will 
 need to update to the FIM version 1.0.2.1 GUI executable included in the 
 RMIM_1_0_1.ZIP file. This software has been designed to be CPRS Gui Tools
 Menu compatible.  RMIM*1*1 was initiated to address the following
 NOIS's:
  
 1.  NHM-0703-10176 Admission Date Range.
 The routine being called in the original software did not bring back all 
 of the admissions for a patient.  The server side does not need a routine
 change. However, the kids build changes the remote procedure call used for
 retrieving this data.  The Delphi compiled executable required an update
 to retrieve and format the parameters being passed from the VistA server
 by the new Remote Procedure Call.
  
 2.  TNV-0603-31140 FIM GUI Defaults to Brokerserver, 9200.
 The executable was not recognizing the s= and p= for server and port that 
 were being passed to the application from the CPRS GUI Tools Menu when 
 the software was executed within CPRS.  This has been updated in the 
 Delphi compiled executable.
  
 3.  HWH-0603-41501 '' is not a valid integer.  This NOIS began with the 
 previously noted problem, and eventually it was discovered that the site 
 was having a problem with FIM executing behind CPRS on the users desktop 
 when the user accessed FIM through the CPRS GUI Tools Menu.  The 
 application has been updated to remain focused on top of CPRS when 
 initialized from the CPRS tools menu.  It is not in stay on top modal 
 mode, but will prevent the user from not knowing that the application is 
 running behind CPRS or other applications.
  
  
    Routine Summary:
 There are no routines transported with this patch.  The Kids build 
 contains an update to the RMIMFIM Option, it updates the version of the 
 option to Context version 1.0.2.1 and adds a remote procedure.  
  
    INSTALLATION AND DOCUMENTATION FILES:

   PRE-INSTALLATION INFORMATION:
   =============================
   
 The VistA installation of this patch requires that you first have 
 RMIM 1.0 (Version 1.0 of the FIM software) already configured.
  
 The Functional Independence Measurement is run on both the client and 
 VistA.  The installation is a two-part process involving the client 
 workstation and VistA.

 FIM.
  
         1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
         2.  Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the install, but
             you should select a time when minimal numbers of users are on.

             respond "0".
  
 Client Side:
 ============
  
 Note:  We strongly recommend that you install the Functional Independence 
 Measurement executable (FIM.exe) on a network drive and distribute 
 shortcuts to client desktops.
  
  
         1.  Go to the directory that you installed FIM version 1 into and 
             Archive the executable until installation of the new 
             executable is complete.
  
         2.  There are three ways to make the FIM.EXE available to users:
  
             a. Retrieve and Unzip the file RMIM_1_0_1.ZIP into the
                directory that you had installed the original FIM version
                1.0.  This will ensure that your previous setup is left 
                as the previous version without necessitating going to 
                VistA to set up the CPRS Tools Menu, or change the 
                shortcut that users follow to connect to a network share 
                to execute the software.  If the site chooses to initiate
                FIM in a way other than through CPRS (i.e. desktop  
                shortcut), then Patient Selection will be controlled by 
                FIM.  FIM will run as a stand-alone.
  
             b. If the site chooses to pass parameters within the Tools 
                menu of CPRS, and have not set the previous version of the
                software to do this, then follow these instructions.  This
                will allow the software to pass parameters for the Patient
                and Server to be controlled by CPRS and CPRS only.  Here is
                an example of setting up the GUI Tool Menu to allow passing
                of parameters to FIM.exe:
             Within VistA select GUI Parameters Option: GUI Tool Menu Items
  
             CPRS GUI Tools Menu may be set for the following:
  
                 1  User    USR [choose from NEW PERSON]
                 2  Location LOC [choose from HOSPITAL LOCATION]
                 2.5 Service SRV [choose from SERVICE/SECTION]
                 3  Division DIV [choose from INSTITUTION]
                 4  System   SYS [YOUR SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV]
                 9  Package  PKG [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]
  
             Enter selection: 4 System YOUR SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV
             ----Setting CPRS GUI Tools Menu for System: YOUR
                 SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV
  
            Select Sequence: 17 (choose your desired sequence.)
  
            Sequence: 17//   17
            Name=Command:&FIM="H:\FIM.exe" s=%SRV p=%PORT d=%DFN
                 ("H:\" listed above refers to a mapped drive, if
                  the software exists on a server you could replace
                  the mapped drive "H:\" with the server name and
                  directory location for the software e.g.
                  \\vhaserver\share\FIM.exe)
  
             c. If the site chooses to hang the software within the Tools 
                menu of CPRS without passing parameters, then Patient 
                Selection will be controlled by FIM.  FIM will run as a
                stand alone.  A set-up example for FIM.exe will run in this
                method, please see below:
             
             Select GUI Parameters Option:  GUI Tool Menu Items
  
             CPRS GUI Tools Menu may be set for the following:
  
             1  User      USR [choose from NEW PERSON]
             2  Location  LOC [choose from HOSPITAL LOCATION]
             2.5 Service SRV [choose from SERVICE/SECTION]
             3  Division DIV [choose from INSTITUTION]
             4  System   SYS [YOUR SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV]
             9  Package  PKG [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]
  
             Enter selection: 4 System YOUR SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV 
             ---Setting CPRS GUI Tools Menu for System: YOUR 
             SYSTEM.MED.VA.GOV
  
             Select Sequence: 17
  
             Sequence: 17//  17
             Name=Command:&FIM="H:\FIM.exe"
  
             
         3.  Run ServerList on each client to ensure a proper connection 
             to an M server.
