Subject: NPI / MRA ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The general purpose of this patch is to allow the Austin Automation Center
 (AAC) to commence sending Fee Basis MRAs of a longer length in preparation
 for a future Fee Basis NPI enhancement patch (FB*3.5*98). This patch will
 adjust longer length MRAs back to the shorter length that is needed prior
 to the installation of the FB*3.5*98 patch. 
  
 This patch will allow VistA Fee to accept vendor MRA messages transmitted
 by Central Fee to a VAMC's with either the current format or the new
 longer format. If the new longer format is received, the Fee software
 will merely ignore the additional data (NPI value) if present.
  
 During field testing of this patch, Central Fee only transmitted MRAs with
 the current format. Test sites were asked to confirm that they could
 receive and process MRA's that have the current format.
  
 Central Fee will 'turn on their changes' to recognize the new format MRA 
 on a predetermined future date. Once this happens, they will have the
 capability to send and receive the new format MRA.
  
 Sites will not have the capability to send the new format MRA until patch
 FB*3.5*98 is released. However, it will be possible for Central Fee to
 transmit the new format MRA to all sites but the NPI data will be blank 
 for now. The ability of VistA Fee to accept the longer format was
 thoroughly tested in the Bay Pines test lab. However, nothing is really
 done with the new format since the software changes included with
 FB*3.5*97 will ignore NPI data if it is present in an incoming message.
  
 Patch FB*3.5*98 is being developed to include NPI values in the outgoing 
 MRA transmissions to Central Fee. It will allow VistA Fee the ability to
 accept and store NPI data received from Central Fee.
