Subject: REGIONAL COUNSEL ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This enhancement is at the request of the Chief Business Office.  This 
 enhancement will provide the Billing staff with the capability viewing 
 reason codes associated with outstanding claims that are referred to the 
 Office of Regional Counsel (RC).
  
 The existing RC interface was created in response to VHA Directive 
 97-023, which mandated automated transmission of outstanding claims from 
 the AR application to RC.  This communication, however, did not include 
 the identification of reason codes with descriptions of action, which 
 makes tracking and follow-up of claims difficult.  The Accounts 
 Receivable patch PRCA*4.5*189 will implement the capture of this 
 information.  Along with the capture, it was requested this information 
 be viewable to the billing staff.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 After installation of this patch when users use the option "Third Party 
 Follow-Up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP THIRD PARTY]" and include the 
 receivables that have been referred to Regional Counsel, the report will 
 indicate the reason code for the referral if one exists.  The reason code 
 will be printed in parenthesis where there used to be an asterisk.  The 
 possible choices for the referral are:
  
          1 - LITIGATION ISSUES
          2 - VET NOT RESP FOR COST OF CARE 
          3 - REFUSAL TO PAY GOV HOSPITAL 
          4 - VETERAN PAID DIRECTLY
          5 - MCCR REF WITH RC CONSENT
  
 In order to allow for receivables that have previously been referred, it 
 is possible that a receivable may not have a reason code.  If there is no 
 reason code then an asterisk will be printed in place of the reason code 
 number.
  
  
 Additionally the option "First Party Follow-Up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP 
 FIRST PARTY]" has been enhanced to include charges related to Long Term 
 Care.
  
  
 Finally in anticipation of the reactivation of the IVM interface to 
 perform back billing when a corrected MT status is identified, the 
 interface has been updated to handle the new tiered co-payment 
 determination functionality.
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 The routines IBJDF11 and IBJDF12 have been modified to print the reason 
 code if it exists.
  
 The routines IBJDF4, IBJDF41, and IBJDF42 have been modified to allow for 
 selection and printing of LTC Charges.
  
 The IBAMTV2 has been modified to perform the new outpatient tiered MT 
 co-payment determination when an IVM transmission is received.
