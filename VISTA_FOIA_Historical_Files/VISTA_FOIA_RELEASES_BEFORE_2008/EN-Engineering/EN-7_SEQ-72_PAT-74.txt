Subject: DATA CLEANSING REPORTS FOR 6911 FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch exports a series of reports that will be used to prepare the
 data in the AEMS/MERS EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (#6911) file for conversion to 
 the CoreFLS system.
    
 This patch adds a new menu option, CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing
 Reports [ENH DATA CLEANSING], to the Program Management [ENMAN] menu.
 This menu option requires the new security key ENH DATA CLEANSING.
    
 Added to the new CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing Reports [ENH DATA
 CLEANSING] menu is the Equipment Category - 6911 [ENH EQUIPMENT 
 CATEGORY] menu that contains the following options:
     Summary Report [ENH 6911 SUMMARY REPORT]
     Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6911 REQUIRED RPT]
     Lookup Fields w/ Invalid Data Report [ENH 6911 LOOKUP RPT]
     Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6911 NON-REQUIRED RPT]
    
 The reports examine the following five fields: 
     NAME (#.01)
     RESPONSIBLE SHOP (Multiple) (#6911.01,.01)
     TECHNICIAN (RESPONSIBLE SHOP Multiple) (#6911.01,1)
     FREQUENCY (RESPONSIBLE SHOP/FREQUENCY Multiple) (#6911.13,.01)
     PROCEDURE (RESPONSIBLE SHOP/FREQUENCY Multiple) (#6911.13,4)
  
 If any field is empty or has invalid data, it is included on one of the
 reports.
    
 This patch includes four reports, one summary and three detailed:
  
  1.  Summary Report - lists all the fields examined and a count of how 
      many times each field is either empty or contains invalid data.
    
  2.  Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each required field in 
      the EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (#6911) file that is empty. (A field is
      defined as required when the empty field causes functionality
      problems for CoreFLS.)
    
  3.  Lookup Fields with Invalid Data Report - lists each field in the
      EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (#6911) file that contains invalid data.
    
  4.  Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each non-required
      field in the EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (#6911) file that is empty. Because
      the fields are not required, they may be left empty, but populating
      these fields with data will improve functionality after conversion to
      CoreFLS.
