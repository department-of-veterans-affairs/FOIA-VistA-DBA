Subject: BENEFICIARY REPORT & MISC NOIS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects two problems with the Beneficiary Report, and deals
 with several miscellaneous NOIS.
  
 MUS-0300-72727  Site reported that the Beneficiary Report errored out with
 an undefined error.  This error occurred when there was an Incident
 entered with a local Incident Type.  
  
 ALT-0100-20667, IRO-0300-40987  Sites reported that some Incidents were
 not showing up on Beneficiary Report.  It was found that the Incidents
 were for outpatients which had no ward entered in the Incident record.
 The report has been modified so that any records excluded from the report
 due to having no ward entered for a patient will be listed in an exemption
 report placed at the end of the report.
  
 ALT-0100-21215  The Outpatient Report displays a message "Incomplete data,
 exiting the report." when there are no records found.  Text has been
 changed to "No records found for the selected date range."  It was
 found that the Incidents/Ward Report has the same message, and is being
 changed, also.
  
 HIN-1099-40681  The wording of the mail bulletin generated by the entry of
 a new Incident Report was misleading.  The text placed the date the
 Incident was entered on the second line of the message, but did not make
 it clear that this date was the date of entry rather than the Incident
 Date.
  
   User EDNA CURTIN (COMPUTER SPECIALIST) entered incident case number 
   500TA.000246 involving incident Fall on MAY 9,2000.
   Date of Incident: MAY 6,2000
   Patient: CARTER,DAMON    SSN: 222222232
  
 The revised text is as follows.
  
   On MAY 9,2000 User EDNA CURTIN (COMPUTER SPECIALIST) entered Incident
   case number 500.000246 involving an incident, type Fall.
   Date of Incident: MAY 6,2000@11:00
   Patient: CARTER,DAMON    SSN: 222222232
  
 EKH-0400-40030  Some sites would like the time of day to be a required
 part of the Date of Incident field.  Since not all sites want this
 feature, a site can now enter into the Incident Reporting Site Parameters
 whether or not it wants to require time to be entered.  The option used is
 Site Parameters enter/edit [QAN SITE PARAMETERS ENTER/EDIT].
  
   Site Parameters enter/edit
   MAIL GROUP (QAN): INCIDENTS & OCCURRENCES// 
   BULLETIN SENT (QAN): YES// 
   RESPONSIBLE PERSON SWITCH: 
   QM TIME FRAME: 4// 
   QAN TIME REQUIRED:  ??
                     --
      Field set to '1' or 'Yes' if site requires Date of Incident to  
      include time of day.
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 QAN TIME REQUIRED: 
  
 When entering an Incident, if this parameter is set to "YES" the user will
 be required to enter a date and time.
  
 A new field has been added to the QUALITY ASSURANCE SITE PARAMETER file
 (#740) to accommodate this change.  It is QAN Time Required, field number
 755.  This Data Dictionary change is being released in patch QAQ*1.7*7.
  
 In addition, changes have been made to input template [QAQA QAN SITE
 PARAMETERS] (file 740).  This change will also appear in patch QAQ*1.7*7.
  
 Two new input templates have been created, [QAN ENTER TIME] (file#742.4)
 and [QAN QUICK EDIT] (file 742.4).
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 ALT-0100-20677, ALT-0100-21215, EKH-0400-40030, HIN-1099-40681,
 IRO-0300-40987, MUS-0300,72727. 
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VistA users will not be affected.
  
    Quick Incident Entry [QAN INCIDENT QUICK]
    Brief Incident Enter/Edit [QAN INCIDENT REPORT]
    Site Parameters enter/edit [QAN SITE PARAMETERS ENTER/EDIT]
    Incident Reporting Main Menu ... [QAN INCIDENT MAIN MENU]
  
                 Install Time - less than 5 minutes
