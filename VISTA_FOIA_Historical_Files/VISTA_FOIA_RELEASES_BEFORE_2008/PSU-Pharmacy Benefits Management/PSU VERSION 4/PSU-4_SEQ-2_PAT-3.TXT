Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Benefits Management Extract Enhancement III (PBM EE III)
 project provides enhancements to send all chemistry lab test results to
 the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) National Server.  These
 results are sent via Health Level 7 (HL7) messages using the Health Level 
 Seven Optimized (HLO) messaging service.
  
 This patch includes an environmental check routine, PSU3ENCK. The
 preinstallation steps require the logical link, PSU SEND, to be defined
 correctly. It checks to see if it is unfurling within a test area or a
 live area and if the link is configured incorrectly, the installation
 lists what is wrong with the link and then aborts.  The IRM installer can
 troubleshoot the link and run the installation of PSU*4*3 once he has the
 link defined as specified. If this patch is installed into a legacy 
 system, the environmental check routine will treat the load as if it were 
 a test area, so no messages get sent from this account to PBM.
  
 This patch also includes the listening software employed at the CMOP-NAT
 server. It is routines PSULRHL2 & PSULRHL3. NEITHER OF THESE ROUTINES 
 WILL BE USED AT THE SITES but they will be used by the CMOP-NAT server 
 and thus are included in this patch. These two routines should only be
 deployed on the CMOP-NAT server for PBM.

 CMOP-NAT is the server where we tested HLO and PSU*4*3. Furthermore, once
 released PSU*4*3 will send PBM HL7 data from every facility to the PBM
 national database on CMOP-NAT.
