Subject: Edit Logical Link.

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 1) Some sites have been timing out during message transmission, the time
 out period was increased at the problem sites causing a resolution to
 the issue. It has also been decided that the Exceed Re-Transmit Action 
 field within the logical link be set to restart.
  
 Please follow the below instructions to edit these fields after you 
 have installed the build.  Stop the ROR SEND logical link if your site
 has started it.
  
         Within the [HL7 MAIN MENU] option, select the Filer and LINK 
         MANAGEMENT OPTIONS [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] option, within this
         option select the LINK EDIT [HL EDIT LOGICAL LINKS] option. You
         will be presented the following prompt:
  
               Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE:
  
         Enter ROR SEND at the above prompt, a Screenman screen will be 
         displayed that will show the parameters for the ROR SEND logical 
         link.
         Move to the LLP TYPE field and press Enter. A new sub-form will 
         be displayed, and this screen shows the TCP lower level parameters
         for the ROR SEND logical link.
  
         Move to the ACK TIMEOUT field edit this field to 600.  Move to 
         the EXCEED RE-TRANSMIT ACTION field, edit this field to 'restart'.
         Close this sub-form using the close command, you will be returned
         to the main form.
         Save these new values using the SAVE command and close the main
         form using the EXIT command. Then start the logical link as
         described in the Clinical Case Registries Hepatitis C 
         Installation/Implementation Guide (ROR_0IG.PDF).
  
 2) Sites have been asked to send  information to the Implementation
 Manager which will be used for security purposes within the transmission
 of historical data to the AAC (see page 44 of the Clinical Case Registries
 Installation/Implementation guide).   This information included the IP
 address of the sending facility.  This IP address must be a static IP
 address, not the dynamic one that can be allocated to workstations.  The
 most reliable way to send these files is within the site's operating
 system.
  
 Please note that the FTP address for the Austin Automation Center has 
 changed from what is detailed in the Clinical 
 Case Registries Installation/Implementation guide.  On page 44 the guide 
 lists vaaachep().aac.va.gov as the address, please disregard this 
 address and use hepdb2.aac.va.gov.  
  
 At a DSM/VMS site log onto a node at the system level. This will present 
 to the user the '$' prompt.  At the $ prompt perform the following steps 
 using your data files and e-mail address.
  
 **NOTE:In this example I am transferring a file called S123T01.hdt, you 
 will have different file names that your historical data extraction tasks 
 created. Also at the password prompt I entered my e-mail address, at this
 prompt you must enter your own e-mail address.

 On a Cache system, the user will have to access the console of the system 
 either directly, or by using Remotely Possible, to assure a static IP 
 address when the file is FTP'd to Austin.
  
 We have also found that some sites have converted from 152 numbers to 10 
 numbers (for example 152.132.10.1 can change to 10.130.10.1) since they 
 submitted their IP address.  
  
 When attempting to connect to the AAC, sites will be immediately 
 disconnected if the sending sites IP address doesn't match the IP address 
 submitted to the Implementation Manager.  Please check with the system 
 administrator to see if your site is going to be converted to an IP 
 address that starts with a 10.  Also double check the IP address within 
 your system and check this against what was submitted to the 
 Implementation Manager. If there are any discrepancies please e-mail the 
 changes and updates to the Implementation Manager at 
 Claire.Hill@med.va.gov.
  
 Please also remember to transfer the Historic Extract files to the AAC in
 binary mode.
  
 3) When installing this package into test accounts do NOT set up the [ROR 
 TASK] option in Taskman (step 7 of the Clinical Case Registries Hepatitis
 C Installation/Implementation Guide) and do not start the logical link
 [ROR SEND] within the VistA HL7 system (step 6 of the Clinical Case
 Registries Hepatitis C Installation/Implementation Guide). Setting these
 options up will cause the system to send test data to the AAC.
  
 4) The person that set up the Historic Extract receives an empty VA Alert
 after a complete and successful run of the Historic Extract.  This is not 
 due to a crash or any error's so please just ignore.
  
 5) The daily task on Taskman [ROR TASK] can be run during any off peak
 time.  Setting the transmission time to a less obvious time (i.e. 20 after
 the hour or 20 to the hour as opposed to half past the hour or on the
 hour) will spread the overnight load at the AAC.
 The AAC does a back up between 10pm and 2am central time.  They can 
 handle messages being sent during this time, these messages get put in a 
 holding queue and processed when the system is back up and running.  
 However, avoiding these times will speed up the processing of these
 messages in the holding queue.
