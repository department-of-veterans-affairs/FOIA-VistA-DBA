Subject: CORRECT DATA IN PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 If an employee received a promotion within PP 03-06 or PP 03-07, their 
 SALARY, GRADE, and STEP may not be correct in the PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459)
 file. This patch will compare the values in these fields with the 
 corresponding fields in the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) file, and will correct 
 the necessary fields.
  
 A report will be sent to the IRM personnel who installs the patch. The
 Payroll Supervisor should review the report to verify that the changes are
 correct and should work with IRM to update any employees that were not 
 corrected by this patch.  IRM can use FileMan to edit these fields if
 necessary.  Additional help can be obtained by calling the NVS help desk
 at 1-888-596-4357.
