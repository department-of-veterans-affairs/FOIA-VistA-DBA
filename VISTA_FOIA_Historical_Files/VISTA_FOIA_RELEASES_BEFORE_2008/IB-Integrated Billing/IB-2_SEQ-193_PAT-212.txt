  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1.  IND-0902-42308     CAN'T ENTER INDIV PROV # FOR TRICARE 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    In the initial analysis for electronic billing, it was felt that
    Tricare (CHAMPUS) would not require entry of individual id numbers
    so the SOURCE LEVEL MINIMUM setting was set to INSURANCE CO - ALL PROV.
    Some sites are now finding it necessary to enter individual provider
    id's in order to bill Tricare.   
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects the issue by modifying the SOURCE LEVEL MINIMUM
    field (#.02) for the CHAMPUS ID record in the IB PROVIDER ID # TYPE FILE  
    (#355.97) to contain a value of 0 (NONE).  This change allows the CHAMPUS
    ID type to be selectable at the "Select Provider ID Type:" prompt when 
    using the PROVIDER ID MAINTENANCE function.
   
  TECHNICAL:
  ==========
  1.  File number 355.97, field number .02, record number 3 is 
      changed from 3 to 0.
   
      Before:  ^IBE(355.97,3,0)=CHAMPUS ID^3^^^^1
       After:  ^IBE(355.97,3,0)=CHAMPUS ID^0^^^^1
