Subject: SWITCH UCI and OTHER bugs

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  
  This patch includes a fix for a problem with multiple sign-ons when the
  user must change their verify code or the user encounters an error that
  kicks them off the system. They are left marked as signed on and IRM must
  clear them. Also included is the fix to code that was changing the old
  location for multiple sign-on when dropping into programmer mode.
  NOIS: DAY-1095-41499, DDC-1095-53156
   
  Fixed the UNDEF error that happened when the Switch UCI option was
  used, This option is on the toolbox menu. It calls routine XUS3A.
  Under DSM there were changes to %XUCI and ZU to HALT the process
  after a UCI switch.
   
  Included is a new entry for the FACILITY TYPE file #4.1, the entry is 
  DDC the DENVER DISTRIBUTION CENTER.
   
  The ZUVXD routine also has a change to prevent dataset hang-up errors from
  ZSLOT devices from filling the error trap.

   6. After installing this patch, you need to move 1 or 2 of the following
      routines from your productions account to the manager account:
      For Datatree     ZOSVDTM 
      For Micronetics  ZOSVMSM
      For Intersystems ZOSVMSQ
      For DSM          ZOSVVXD and XUCIVXD
         and rename to %ZOSV be sure to move the routine to any other CPU's.
         Example: ZL ZOSVVXD ZS %ZOSV
         For DSM also ZL XUCIVXD ZS %XUCI
   7. After installing this patch, you need to rename 1 of the following
      routines in the production account: 
      For Datatree     ZUDTM
      For Micronetics  ZUMSM
      For Intersystems ZUMSQ
      For DSM          ZUVXD
          renamed to ZU.  
   8.  On MSM move the routines to the other servers.  
       On DSM, rebuild your map set.
