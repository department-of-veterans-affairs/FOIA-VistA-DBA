 Interface Overview
 ------------------
 The Insurance Identification and Verification project (IIV) implements 
 automatic and electronic methods to identify and confirm insurance 
 coverage for veterans.  This is accomplished through a series of batch 
 extracts from VistA that produce either insurance confirmation requests or 
 insurance identification requests.  These requests are transmitted out of 
 VistA in HL7 format to the BusinessWare commercial application suite from 
 Vitria.  The BusinessWare server is a dedicated server in Austin, TX and 
 provides the link or gateway between VistA and the outside world.  
 BusinessWare aggregates and translates these messages into ANSI X12 
 format, sends them to WebMD, who sends them to the participating insurance 
 companies.  The insurance companies transmit their responses back to 
 WebMD, who sends them back into BusinessWare.  The ANSI X12 responses are 
 then translated back into HL7 and routed to the originating VistA system. 
                   
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 The Insurance Identification and Verification project (IIV) provides an 
 extension to the existing Vista Insurance Buffer functionality to enable 
 electronic discovery and confirmation of third-party commercial health 
 insurance coverage for registered VA patients.  Each night a process is 
 run, via TaskMan which compiles a batch of insurance eligibility inquiries 
 based on activity within the system.  Sources include unverified insurance 
 information entered in the Insurance Buffer as well as patients that have 
 scheduled appointments or have had past encounters, but have not had a 
 recent verification of their insurance files.  If a patient has no 
 insurance information on record, inquiries may be made to the most 
 commonly billed insurance companies for that specific site, in an attempt 
 to discover previously unknown coverage.  Sites are able to tailor the 
 selection of patients for the nightly batch through a set of parameters 
 that allow control of the volume of electronic inquiries made, which 
 sources should be considered and date range parameters.
                 
 Inquiries are then verified through an exchange of HIPAA-compliant 
 electronic communications between the VistA system and a National 
 Healthcare Insurance Cache server that is located at the AAC in Austin, 
 Texas.   This national datacenter receives the eligibility inquiry 
 messages and issues a response by first checking its database for any 
 fresh information that it may have on file, or if no current information 
 is available it will forward the request to an electronic clearinghouse of 
 insurance information.  WebMD is currently contracted to handle the 
 clearinghouse services.  The clearinghouse, in turn, forwards the inquiry 
 to the requested payer, ex. Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, etc.  The payer 
 issues a response message to confirm or deny coverage based on the 
 information provided in the inquiry.  The national cache database is 
 updated with the results to potentially be used for future inquiries, and 
 the response message is routed back to the VistA site and posted to the 
 Insurance Buffer where authorized users can review and accept the returned 
 information into the current insurance files through enhancements to the 
 insurance buffer list options.
                          
 One challenge inherent in this process results from the fact that each VA 
 site is able to maintain a separate list of insurance companies.  In order 
 for the various VistA locales to be able to effectively request 
 eligibility information for the various payers, a national VA insurance 
 payer list has been established to provide a standard identification 
 system for all payers that are participating in this process.  
 Enhancements have been added to allow each VA site the ability to link the 
 insurance companies in their own site's list to the appropriate payer in 
 the national payer list.  This standardizes the identification of the 
 payer to which each inquiry should be directed.
                             
 Additional features were also added to assist the users of the insurance 
 buffer with IIV related tasks.  A new feature named "Auto Match" has been 
 added that allows the system to be "taught" rules for matching the user-
 entered insurance company names in the insurance buffer to existing 
 entries in the site's insurance company file.  Also, a new method has been 
 added for accepting information from an insurance buffer entry into the 
 patient's permanent insurance records that allows each data field change 
 to be individually accepted or rejected.  Another feature allows a user to 
 select multiple buffer entries for the Process, Expand, and Reject entry 
 actions, to ease the process of working with larger sets of buffer 
 entries. 
                              
 Configuration Requirements
 --------------------------
 As mentioned previously, there is a new IIV site parameter screen.  It is 
 accessed through the existing MCCR Site Parameters option.  It is 
 imperative that insurance supervisor staff review the IIV Installation 
 Guide found on the FTP sites for detailed instructions on the set-up, use, 
 and function of the IIV site parameters.  These parameters will govern how 
 IIV will function at your facility.

 INSTALLATION NOTES
 ==================
                                   
 There is one new global associated with this patch:  ^IBCN
                                  
 The new IBCN global needs to be created prior to installation.  Using the 
 appropriate global management utility, create IBCN and assign the 
 following global access privileges: System = RWD (or RWP), World = RWD (or 
 RWP), Group = RWD (or RWP), and UCI = RWD (or RWP).  This may require 
 assistance from a System Manager.  IBCN will contain data for three new 
 files in this patch:
                         
 IIV RESPONSE (#365)
 IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE (#365.1)
 IIV AUTO MATCH (#365.11)
                         
 The IIV AUTO MATCH file (#365.11) is not expected to be large.  However, 
 both the IIV RESPONSE file (#365) and the IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE file 
 (#365.1) may grow to become quite large depending on how the facility sets 
 up and activates the batch extracts in the IIV Site Parameters option.
                              
 The post-installation program, IBCNEPST, performs several tasks.
                                  
 1.   Sets up the IIV specific process user, INTERFACE,IB IIV, in the New 
      Person file (#200).
                          
 2.   Compiles the Most Popular Insurance Companies list by looping through 
      the Bill/Claims file (#399) for the last year and finds the top ten 
      insurance companies that bills were sent to.
                            
 3.   Sets up the No Payer entry in the new Payer file (#365.12)
                            
 4.   If a new install, defines the Batch Extract stub entries.  The user 
      must then follow the Post-Installation instructions to configure the 
      Batch Extracts parameters.

 ======================= INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =======================
                          
 Installation of this patch is mandatory at all sites.
                          
 This patch should be installed after normal business hours, when all 
 Integrated Billing Users are logged off the system.  The Post-Installation 
 routine queues a background process to calculate the most frequently 
 billed ("popular") insurance companies for the facility for the previous 
 one year period. 
                             
 The PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] option needs 
 to be placed out of order during installation of this patch.
                               
 Install Time - less than 10 minutes in the foreground.  The aforementioned 
 background process which runs immediately can take up to 45 minutes to 
 complete.
                                
 The installation of this patch and configuration of this functionality is 
 more involved than the usual patch.  Therefore the installation 
 instructions are not included here in the patch description.  Instead the 
 install steps have been included in the Installation guide along with the 
 functional configuration steps.
                        
 * IMPORTANT - Refer to the Installation Guide for specific instructions - 
 PRE-INSTALLATION CHECKLIST, INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS, POST-INSTALLATION 
 CONFIGURATION, IIV SITE REGISTRATION AND POST-REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS.
