 NOIS OVERVIEW:

 1) HD64329 - MUS-1004-71572     GETTING ERROR 716 ON PTF RECORD
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Error code 716 is not in the PTF AUSTIN ERROR CODES file (#45.64)
 so sites do not understand why the PTF record is being rejected.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The post-init routine DG53P640 will add the following codes 
 to file #45.64:
  
         ;;004^station number and suffix invalid
         ;;070^transaction does not match N101 transaction or Master Record
         ;;139^101 transaction equal to preceding 101 transaction or 
 Master Record   
         ;;141^replacement date of admission is later than first date of 
 surgery
         ;;142^replacement date of admission is later than first movement 
 date
         ;;170^transaction does not match 101 trans. or Master Record (131 
 trans only
         ;;171^update without data in any field except control fields (131 
 trans only
         ;;441^surgical date in N402 transaction not equal date of one 401
         ;;455^a replacement code or a $ eliminated a required related code
         ;;457^duplicate surg codes or dupe of one in Master in different 
 position
         ;;471^updte without data in any field except control fields (one 
 field reqrd
         ;;472^updte 431/432 date of surgery does not match date of 
 surgery in 401/02
         ;;546^trans. 500 deleted the discharge 501 segment without 
 replacement 501 
         ;;553^diagnostic code used without a required related code
         ;;555^a replacement code or a $ eliminated a required related code
         ;;557^duplicate diag codes or dupe of one in Master in different 
 position
         ;;570^transaction does not match 101 transaction or Master Record
         ;;571^updte without data in any field except control fields (one 
 field reqrd
         ;;572^update date of movement does not match date of movement in 
 record
         ;;573^combined leave and pass days greater than total elapsed days
         ;;645^more than 32 transactions submitted
         ;;655^a replacement code or a $ eliminated a required related code
         ;;670^transaction does not match N101 transaction or Master Record
         ;;716^duplication of a report of death. Type of disposition '6' 
 or '7'
         ;;718^701 without an "X" in ONLY-DX must be accompanied by a 702
         ;;719^trans. accompanied by 701 with "X" in ONLY-DX or "summary 
 diag" codes
         ;;739^discharge segment already in Master Record
         ;;740^date of discharge is later than processing date
         ;;741^date of discharge does not equal last date of transfer
         ;;742^date of discharge for fiscal year before earlier than 
 current FY
         ;;743^replacement date of discharge is earlier than latest date 
 of surgery
         ;;770^no matching 101 transaction or Master Record
         ;;771^updte without data in any field except control fields (one 
 field reqrd
         ;;772^update with matching 101 transaction but without a matching 
 701/2/3

 2) HD64467 - HIN-1204-40238 Error when CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS COUNTY field
                             is empty
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When inquiring on the CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS COUNTY field (.14111) in the 
 Patient file using Fileman, if the patient has CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS  
 info on their record, but the CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS COUNTY field itself is
 empty, an error occurs.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The output transform of field .14111 has been modified so as not 
 to cause an error.
  
 Old output transform:
  
 S Y(0)=Y N Z0 S Z0=+$P($G(^DPT(D0,.141)),"^",5) Q:'Z0
 S Y=$P($G(^DIC(5,Z0,1,Y,0)),"^",3)
  
 Modified output transform:
  
 S Y(0)=Y Q:Y']""  N Z0 S Z0=$P($G(^DPT(D0,.141)),"^",5) Q:'Z0
 S Y=$P($G(^DIC(5,Z0,1,Y,0)),"^",3)

 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*640):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*640.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
