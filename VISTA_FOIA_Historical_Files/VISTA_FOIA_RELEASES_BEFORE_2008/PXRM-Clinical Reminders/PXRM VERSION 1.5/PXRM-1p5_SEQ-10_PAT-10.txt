Associated patches: (v)PXRM*1.5*9  <<= must be installed BEFORE `PXRM*1.5*10'

Subject: MST DATE CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 After patches PXRM*1.5*7 and PXRM*1.5*9 were released, it was learned
 that the DG API used to update the MST HISTORY file (#29.11) has certain
 restrictions on the format of the date that it will accept. These
 include: the date cannot be a partial date, it must have the time, and
 it cannot be a future date. Because PCE allows historical dates and
 does not require the time, and the CPRS GUI allows an encounter date to
 be an appointment date that may be in the future, some updates to the MST
 History file were being rejected by the DG API. This patch makes
 changes to the dates that are being given to the DG API so that they
 will meet the above criteria and not be rejected.
  
 In the case of the MST dialog, instead of using the Encounter Date and
 time, which may be in the future, the current date and time (NOW) will be
 used. For synchronizations, Date Visit Created will be used instead of
 the encounter date and time. If the Date Visit Created does not contain
 the time, 12 noon will be used.

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take
 less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 4. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (PXRM*1.5*10)
  
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
    respond 'NO'.
  
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'YES'. When prompted to select the
    options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
    GMTS*
    PXRM*
    IBDF PRINT*
    OR CPRS GUI CHART
    ORS HEALTH SUMMARY
  
    When prompted to select the protocols you would like to place out of
    order, enter the following:
  
    ORS AD HOC HEALTH SUMMARY
    ORS HEALTH SUMMARY
    PXRM PATIENT DATA CHANGE
  
 7. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
 8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 9. After the patch has been installed schedule a synchronization [PXRM MST
    SYNCHRONIZATION]. This synchronization will take care of any PCE data
    that has been mapped to the MST reminder terms and is currently not
    getting updated. For example, if you have a health factor that has a
    future or partial date, the update should now be made. If you are using
    the dialog as the sole means of capturing MST data you will not need to
    run the daily synchronization. If you do run it, then it should make 0
    updates. You can check this by running the Reminders MST
    Synchronization Report found under the MST option of the PXRM Managers
    Menu. If you are using mechanisms other than the dialog to input MST
    data you will need to run the synchronization every day.
