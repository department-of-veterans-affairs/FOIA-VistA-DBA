 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. POR-0404-51481     Pharmacy can't dissapprove claims
  
   
    Problem:
    -------
 When the pharmacist is reviewing Fee Basis Prescriptions and
 the veteran has more than 1 prescription, after 1 has been approved
 if a subsequent one needs to be denied, they will encounter a
 problem. The "PRESCRIPTION REVIEW" screen will display the name of 
 the previously approved medication's Generic Drug Name which is NOT
 the one they are trying to deny. 
  
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
 In the FBAA PHARMACY REVIEW screen when the pharmacies has worked the 
 first prescription he/she is prompted with "Want to review another 
 Prescription?". Answering "yes" if the next prescription is in the same
 invoice, the variable FBDRUG is not refreshed and will contains the name
 of the last "VA Generic Drug equivalent" entered.
 This results in the process displaying the previous drug and not 
 the one being worked. The variable FBDRUG will now be cleaned up (KILLED) 
 before working a new prescription with in the same invoice.
