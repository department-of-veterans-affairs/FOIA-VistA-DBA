Subject: AICS-ACRP AIT Conversion

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The following patches are required to be loaded prior to loading this
 patch:
  
 AICS:
 IBD*3*3    IBD*3*6
  
 Integrated Billing:
 IB*2*91
  
 Scheduling:
 SD*5.3*131
  
 This patch contains all the changes found to be necessary throughout the
 AICS package as a result of the release of the Scheduling patch
 (SD*5.3*131) introducing the ACRP APPLICATION INTERFACE TOOL (AIT) for
 outpatient encounter access.  This tool (AIT) was written to provide a
 generic way to access data for outpatient encounters that was previously
 accessed via direct global reads and to allow for replacement of calls to
 obsolete Scheduling-supported files. When Scheduling patch SD*5.3*132 is
 released, Scheduling will no longer be populating or supporting the
 Scheduling Visits file (#409.5), the Outpatient Diagnosis file (409.43) or
 the Outpatient Provider file (#409.44).  The Scheduling package has also
 opted not to support direct references to the Outpatient Encounter file
 (#409.68) anymore.  All references to the Scheduling Visits file, the
 Outpatient Diagnosis file, Outpatient Provider file, and the Outpatient
 Encounter file were replaced with standard calls to these API's.
 Specifically, this patch involves an RPC Broker call on the workstation
 side and a call from manual data entry (MDE) to find the check-out date/time
 for a standalone encounter from the Scheduling Visits file.
  
 There should be no visible changes to the AICS system after this patch is
 loaded.  The system should still produce the same output/behavior as
 before the patch.
  
  
 Routines Changed:
 =================
 IBDFRPC3
  
 The patch replaced a call to scan the Scheduling Visits file with a system
 call to the ACRP AIT to get the same information from the Outpatient
 Encounter file when the scanning workstation requests information or
 during the form identification lookup in manual data entry. This is a call
 to retrieve data about a standalone, add-edit encounter when the patient
 ID information is retrieved after a successful form scan or when
 identifying the form to be entered using MDE.
  
  
 Routines Deleted:
 =================
 IBDFOSG3
 IBDFOSG4
  
 The functionality contained in these 2 routines is obsolete as they were
 written to support a one-time request for information from the MCCR
 program office.
  
 This patch should be installed after normal working hours as it
 involves the scanning workstation functions as well as manual data entry.
 All AICS users should be off the system.
  
   The installation time for this patch is less then 5 minutes.

      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
          patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.

      a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
      b. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu
         Options? YES//', take the default (YES).
      c. When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
