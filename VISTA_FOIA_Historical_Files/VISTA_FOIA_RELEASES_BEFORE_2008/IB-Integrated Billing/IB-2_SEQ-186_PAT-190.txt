Subject: REMOVE SSN FROM COPAY EXEMPT/INCOME TEST LETTERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The patient's full SSN is displayed in the heading of the Copay Exemption,
 and Income Test Reminder letters generated by the Integrated Billing (IB)
 package. Due to right of privacy violations, and the risk of identity
 fraud, it was requested that the SSN on these letters be replaced with the
 first initial of the patient's last name and the last 4 digits of the
 patient's SSN. The routine that prints the heading of the Copay and Test
 Reminder letters (IBARXEPL) has been modified to print this change.
