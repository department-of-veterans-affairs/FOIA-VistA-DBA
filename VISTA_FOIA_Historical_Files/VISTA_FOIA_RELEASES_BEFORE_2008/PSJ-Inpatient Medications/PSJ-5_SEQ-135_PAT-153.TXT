Subject: EXTENDING STOP DATE FOR RENEWALS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  ** This patch addressed issues outlined in PSI-05-062 **
  
  1. PSI-05-062:  When a site has the Inpatient Medication site parameter
     "SAME STOP DATE ON ALL ORDERS:" set to "YES" and the patient's 
     "DEFAULT STOP DATE/TIME" is set to TODAY, and a physician "RENEWS" 
     orders, the default stop date gets calculated as TODAY for the first
     order.  The patient's "DEFAULT STOP DATE/TIME" is extended when the
     first order is accepted and the default stop date for following orders
     is calculated correctly.
  
     This patch is designed to extend the patient's "DEFAULT STOP 
     DATE/TIME" and correctly calculate the default stop date for the 
     first order.
