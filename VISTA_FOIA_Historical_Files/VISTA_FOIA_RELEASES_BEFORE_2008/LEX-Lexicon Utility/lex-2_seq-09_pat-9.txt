  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
    
       1)   Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2*9.
     
       2)   Review your mapped set.  If the routine LEXU is mapped, it 
            should be removed from the mapped set at this time. 
 
      >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
       If you have installed LEX*2*9 into another account, and the 
       Lexicon global ^LEX is translated into the current account,
       you may go directly to step 6 of the installation instructions.
  
       It is not necessary to install the data from the global host
       file LEX2_0P9.GBL more than once per translation.
                                                                           
       >>>>>>>  IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<
  
  
       3)   Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global does
            not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM exist, you 
            will need to kill this global before proceeding.
    
            To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
    
                DSM    
    
                    K ^LEXM
    
                Open M
    
                    The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a 
                    system wide setting, but can be allowed for a particular
                    process using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling 
                    unsubscripted global kills is:
    
                        VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                        VAH>K ^LEXM
    
                    The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a 
                    process is S X=$ZU(68,28,1), however, halting out of 
                    the process and creating a new process will achieve 
                    the same effect.
    
       4)   Install the data from the global host file LEX2_0P9.GBL.  This 
            file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
     
            DSM
    
                Use ^%GTI and the input device LEX2_0P9.GBL
    
            Open M
    
                We recommend that the GUI Thin Client be used to 
                restore the global.  Be sure to select the VAH 
                namespace in the "Global Utilities" window.  Make sure
                that you select the global host file LEX2_0P9.GBL 
                (File / Open) before changing the file format.  With
                the namespace and file selected, change the restore 
                file format to VAX DSM.
    
                Using the GUI utilities will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> 
                error when restoring a global saved under DSM  (usually
                seen when using the CHUI %GI utility to restore a DSM 
                global).
    
            The loading of the global should take from 20 to 35 seconds.
     
       5)   Turn journaling off for globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM.
    
            DSM
         
                Use ^%GLOMAN
                For the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
                Select "Change Journaling Capabilities"
                Select "D" for "Disabled"
    
            Open M
    
                We recommend using the GUI System Operations Utilities.  
                Select the database where the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and
                ^LEXM reside using the Databases tab (to find out where
                a global resides use the GUI global utility directory 
                tab).  Then select Action / Database / Global attributes
                menu item.  In the Attributes and Journaling window, 
                click on the "Globals" button.  Select the globals ^LEX,
                ^LEXT and ^LEXM (note the "All Globals" check box needs
                to be unmarked to select a specific global).  Make sure
                the check box under the column heading "Journal" is 
                unmarked for the ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM globals and then
                click "OK."
    
       6)   Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
     
       7)   Distribution Load:
     
            Load the Distribution from the Packman Message using the 
            Packman function "Install/Check Message."
     
            Environment Check:  
    
                Only package components and system variables will be 
                checked during the loading of the transport global.
     
       8)   KIDS Installation:
     
            Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
            "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*9.  The
            KIDS installation should take from 2.25 to 3.5 minutes 
            (with journaling off) depending on the number of users/jobs 
            on the system.
     
            Environment Check:  
    
                LEX*2*9 data exist (by global translation):
  
                    If the data for LEX*2*9 has been installed and is
                    translated into the current account, then only 
                    package components and system variables will be 
                    checked.
  
                LEX*2*9 data does not exist:
  
                    If the data for LEX*2*9 can not be found (either
                    in the current account or by translation) then the
                    environment check routine will verify the import 
                    global ^LEXM by build namespace and global checksum.
                    This is to insure that the correct import global is
                    loaded and that all of the data contained in the 
                    import global arrived at your site during the FTP 
                    transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the wrong
                    import global or the global fails the checksum, the
                    install will stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and
                    FTP another copy of the import global (see the section
                    on FTP Software Retrieval and step 4 of the 
                    Installation Instructions).
                 
            Disable Options:
     
                Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule 
                Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
     
       9)   Cleanup
     
            a)  If routine LEXU was unmapped as part of step 2, it should
                be returned to the mapped set.
 
            b)  Kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
    
                After the installation of this patch the you will need to
                kill the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent
                import global checksum errors on future installations.
                (see step 3 for "unsubscripted" kills)
    
            c)  If journaling was turned off in step 5 for the ^LEX and
                ^LEXT globals, turn journaling back on.
    
                DSM
    
                    Same instructions as in step 5 except select "E"
                    for "Enabled"
    
                Open M
    
                    Same instructions as in step 5 except make sure the
                    check box under the column heading "Journal" is 
                    marked for the ^LEX and ^LEXT globals.
 
            d)  Delete all routines in the LEX20* namespace (these are 
                v 2.0's environment check and post-install routines).
