Subject: UNABLE TO DETERMINE A FEE SCHEDULE AMOUNT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem encountered when using Medical Fee to 
 enter a payment with modifier SG for ASC Facility Service. The  "SG"
 modifier entered to get the (separate) facility charge is not recognized
 and the charge is processed from the physician fee schedule giving that
 amount unadjusted.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. WWW-0804-50728     Problem after FB*3.5*71
  
   
    Problem:
    -------
 When using Medical Fee to enter a payment with modifier SG for ASC 
 Facility Service the amount is not adjusted for the SG modifier and 
 returns the physician fee amount as if no modifier is entered. 
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
 The process will test for SG modifier and if found will not use the RBRVS 
 fee schedule and returning the message "Unable to determine a FEE 
 schedule amount.".  In that case, the fee clerk would enter a usual &
 customary amount.
  
 Background: 
  
 The RBRVS fee schedule is the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.  This fee
 schedule does not cover facility charges.
  
 VA also obtains information from the Department of Labor OWCP fee schedule
 to adjust the physician fee schedule amount when certain CPT/HCPCS
 modifiers are present.  In past years, DOL included the SG modifier in 
 the modifier level tables with a percentage adjustment.  This was
 intended to indicate a maximum amount for a facility charge as a
 percentage (e.g. 175%) of the physician fee schedule amount.
  
 In reviewing the OWCP 2004 fee schedule and DOL appears to have revised
 it's methodology for the SG modifier.  That modifier was removed from all
 their modifier level tables.  Instead a separate list of Ambulatory
 Surgical Center Allowable Procedures was published. Each of these have a
 multiplier of 1.75.
  
 As usual, VA did import the DOL modifier level tables when the RBRVS fee
 schedule was built.  However, the SG modifiers are no longer in those
 tables so the software is not applying a percentage adjustment when that
 modifier is entered for dates of service in 2004.
