============

 OVERVIEW
 ========
 This patch is released to support the DG* name-spaced changes for the 
 Combat Veteran Interim Solution project. 
  
 The Combat Vet Interim Solution project is the initial step in 
 implementing VHA Directive 2002-049.  
  
 For a detailed description of the functionality included in this project, 
 please refer to the Combat Vet Interim Solution Software Requirements 
 Specification documents.  These documents are located at the following 
 URL:
  
 http://tspr.vista.med.va.gov/warboard/anotebk.asp?proj=749&Type=Active
  
 For more information on the Combat Vet program, please refer to VHA 
 Directive 2002-049, COMBAT VETERANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL SERVICES FOR 
 2 YEARS AFTER SEPARATION FROM MILITARY SERVICE NOTWITHSTANDING LACK OF 
 EVIDENCE FOR SERVICE CONNECTION.
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The software will evaluate veterans in the Patient (#2) file for Combat
 Vet status during an initial seeding of the database. It will also
 calculate the Combat Vet End Date - the date after which free medical care
 will no longer be available without proof that the medical condition is
 service related.  Veterans who could not be evaluated during the seeding
 due to missing or imprecise dates will be listed in a report generated by
 the software  installation(and queued to a non-slaved device). No report
 will be generated if no veterans are found that could not be evaluated due
 to incomplete or missing dates. A mail message will be sent to the
 installer when the seeding is complete. If the seeding task is interrupted
 it can be re-started by using the following call from the programmer
 prompt:
  
 >D REQUE^DG53528P
  
 The mail message that will be sent to the installer when the seeding has 
 completed will look like this:

 Enter message action (in WASTE basket): Ignore// 
  
 A supported API will be provided for use by any package to provide a
 veteran's CV status and the End Date if the veteran is qualified.  Please 
 reference DBIA #4156, COMBAT VETERAN STATUS,for details regarding the API 
 use, input parameters, and meaning of return values.
  
 Combat Vet information will be added to the patient look-up display 
 information, as well as general Patient file APIs (VADPT*).  Below is an 
 example:
  
 Example:
  
    Select PATIENT NAME: Test, Ed   9-23-25 ##########      NSC VETERAN

               Primary Means Test Required from AUG 28,2002
 Enter <RETURN> to continue.
  
 Combat Vet status will be displayed on the Eligibility screen (screen #7)
 of Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA].  The status and Combat 
 Veteran End Date are display only fields.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
  
 This patch installation should be queued to run off-hours. Users may 
 be on the systems as long as the options listed below are placed out 
 of service.  
  
 The installation will start a seeding of the database setting
 the Combat Veteran End Date and CV Date Edited fields (file #2, fields
 .5295 and .5296) if appropriate.  
  
 NOTE: If the task is interrupted it may be restarted at the programmer
 prompt by entering D REQUE^DG53528P.
  
 A mail message will be sent to the installer of the patch when the seeding
 is complete.  The user will be asked for a device to print the report of
 Veterans who could not be evaluated due to missing or imprecise dates.  
  
 NOTE: A slave printer cannot be used for this report.
  
 Installation time will vary from site to site depending upon the number of
 records existing in your Patient file.  The times below will give you an 
 estimation of how long the installation will take.  The following 
 installation times are taken from the test sites of this patch:
  
  SITE EVALUATED     PLATFORM         INSTALL TIME      TOTAL RECORDS
  --------------     --------         ------------      -------------
  Altoona            NT Cache         25 min.           60430
  Portland           Cache            20 min.           225048  
  Louisville         VMS              40 min            169755        
  
  
 1. KIDS will not install data dictionary or data changes in files that 
 require a higher level of Fileman access than is defined for the user 
 doing the KIDS install.  To insure that all data dictionary and data 
 changes distributed in a patch are installed correctly, DUZ(0) must be 
 set equal to the "@" symbol.  Set this variable if necessary, e.g.:
  
      >S DUZ(0)="@" 
  
 2. Download the KIDS file DG_53_P528.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake OIFO to the 
 appropriate directory on your system.
  
 3. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, 
 and enter: DG_53_P528.KID
  
 4. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE 
 SUMMARY section of patches DG*5.3*528, EAS*1.0*36 or SD*5.3*305 are 
 mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 5. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the 
 Installation menu.
  
 6. From this menu, you may elect to u se the following options (when
 prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*528).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 7. Use the Install Package(s) option and select DG*5.3*528.
  
 8. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is 
 recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be rebuilt 
 the next time the system does this task.
  
 9. When prompted 'POST INSTALL DEVICE NAME:', please answer with a valid 
 printer.   NOTE:  A slave device cannot be used for the report generated
 by the seeding.
  
 10. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
 YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
 11. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you 
 would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
          DG LOAD PATIENT DATA     Load/Edit Patient Data
          DG PATIENT INQUIRY       Patient Inquiry
  
 12. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be returned 
 to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 13. If you are running Vista Imaging, use the menu option to copy the
 routines to the Imaging DICOM gateways as follows: "On the Vista server
 (hospital database), use menu option 'Copy Routines to DICOM Gateway'
 located under the 'Imaging System Manager' Menu.  Then on all Text and
 Image gateways use the 'System Maintenance' menu to select Gateway
 Configuration and DICOM Master File and then select 'Download Current
 Radiology and MAS Routines'.  This will cause the up-to-date versions of
 all radiology and MAS routines to be copied to the gateway systems."
