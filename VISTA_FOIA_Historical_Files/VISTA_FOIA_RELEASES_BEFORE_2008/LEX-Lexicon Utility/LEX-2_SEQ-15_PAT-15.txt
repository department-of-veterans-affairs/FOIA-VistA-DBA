Subject: CORRECTIONS TO LEXICON PACKAGE UTILITIES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch includes corrections to three LEXICON UTILITY V. 2.0 routines.
  
  
 1. LEXA1 - Before the patch, entering '^', would not terminate a Lexicon
            search.  Instead the user would be re-prompted.
            A search of the Lexicon may now be terminated by entering the
            '^' at the search string input prompt.
  
 2. LEXA4 - Before this patch, a search which returned more than 500
            matches for display, would result in the error message "A
            suitable term could not be found."  A more explanatory message
            is now displayed, indicating to the user that they may have
            entered search criteria that are too broad.  If the user
            selects a term from the lexicon, the code returned by the
            lexicon search utility is now displayed on the screen.
  
 3. LEXU - This routine contained an error, which would cause the Text
           Integration Utility to incorrectly identify a CPT code as being 
           inactive.  This error would occur when an ICD9 code with the 
           same internal entry number was flagged as inactive.
           This error would not have been visible to the interactive user,
           but may have affected the way that some CPT data was filed in 
           the TIU application.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 1 minute.
  
  
 1.  Use INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LEX*2.0*15).
  a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
      message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT backup
      any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  b.  Compare Transport Global to Current Systems - this option will allow
      you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
      installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
      templates, etc.).
  c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
      integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5.  Use the install Package(s) option and select the package LEX*2.0*15.
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//", respond NO.
  
     When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and 
     Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
  
 7.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
