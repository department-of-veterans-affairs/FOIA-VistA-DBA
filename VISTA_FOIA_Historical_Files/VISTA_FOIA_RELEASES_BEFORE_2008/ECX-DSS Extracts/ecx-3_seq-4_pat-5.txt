Subject: FIX TIME CONVERSION UTILITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
   
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines).  
    
   ****************************************************************
   
   
   This patch to DSS EXTRACTS v3.0 addresses the problem reported in
   NOIS LON-0398-61566. When generating the LAR extract from the LAB
   DSS LAR EXTRACT File (#64.036), it is possible that the TIME
   ORDERED field (#4) and the TIME RESULTS AVAIL field (#6) will hold
   a data element that contains trailing zeroes (e.g., 0800).  The
   function ECXTIME^ECXUTL did not properly handle this circumstance,
   which caused incorrect data to be placed in the TIME ORDERED field
   (#14) and the TIME RESULTS READY field (#16) of the LAB RESULTS
   EXTRACT File (#727.824).
    
   The following DSS Extracts option is affected:
   
   Lab Results Extract                           [ECXLABR]
    
   However, it is possible that the problem could be seen in other
   extract options as well.  The correction contained in this patch
   will prevent the error from occurring in the future in any of the
   DSS extract programs.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  IRM should check
   the list of queued background jobs in TaskManager to be sure that there
   are no DSS Extract jobs (START^ECXTRAC) queued to run while this
   installation is taking place.
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*5):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*5.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
           Package Extracts                    [ECXMENU]
   
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
