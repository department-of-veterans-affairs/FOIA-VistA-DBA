Subject: FIX IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTITY ALLOWED OF E&M CPT CODES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently if a CPT code is part of a subset of E & M codes the user is 
 allowed to enter that CPT code only once per encounter and with a 
 quantity of only 1. 
  
 In menu option "PXCE Encounter Data Entry" under IN [Check Out Interview],
 there are 2 problems being addressed with this logic.
  
   1) If a CPT code begins with a letter it is being identified as an E & M
      code whether or not it truly is. 
   2) Certain E & M codes need to allow a quantity of more than 1 to be 
      ordered. There is a new field in the TYPE OF VISIT file being 
      created in patch IB*2.0*257 to identify E&M codes that can have a
      quantity of grater than one. This quantity flag can be set with the
      menu option EDIT E&M CODE QUANTITY FLAG [IB EDIT E&M CODE QUANTITY 
      FLAG] under the MCCR System Definition Menu [IB SYSTEM DEFINITION
      MENU] option. This option requires the IB SUPERVISOR key.

 PROBLEM 1:
  
 CPT codes beginning with a letter are identified as E & M codes because
 the routine (PXBPCPT) "plus-es" the code before checking to see if it
 is in the 357.69 file (^IBE(357.69)). Since a string starting with a 
 letter always "plus-es" to a zero and since all VA files have a zero 
 node this will always come up true, thereby incorrectly identifying 
 these codes.
  
 RESOLUTION 1:
  
 If the CPT code begins with a number then plus it as is done now. 
 If the CPT code begins with a letter then do not plus it but use it as is.
 (routine: MULTI^PXBPCPT)
   
 PROBLEM 2:
  
 Currently any E & M code is limited to a quantity of 1 at all times.
  
 RESOLUTION 2:
  
 To allow a quantity of more than one for specific codes a new
 field has been added to file 357.69 (see IB*2.0*257 - required patch).
 The field is piece 6 of the zero node. If this field is set to Y then a
 quantity of more than one code may be ordered. If this field is N or null
 then the code is limited to a quantity of 1. The flags are used this way 
 so that if a code has not been updated with this flag it will default to 
 N, thereby allowing only a quantity of 1. This way only codes that need 
 the new logic need to be updated.

 ======================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.
  
   
   
  Installation should take less than 5 minutes.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PX*1.0*132)
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch.
          It will NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.)
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure 
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
            
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*132.
   
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES// respond "NO".
   
  7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES// respond "YES".
  
  8.  When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
      of order, enter the following:
  
         PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE
  
  9.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
