Description:
============

 ***************************NOTE***********************************
 This patch is being marked emergency to avoid processing burdens for both 
 VHA and VBA  that could occur during VBA's conversion to their new 
 corporate database.
  
 The HINQ Replacement - Interim Solution patches are being distributed as 
 a host file containing DVB*4.0*49, DG*5.3*631 and DGBT*1.0*11.  Please 
 see the National Patch Module descriptions of the DG and DGBT patches for 
 further details.  There is a Release Notes document and an Installation
 Guide on the Anonymous directory.
  
 The current VBA databases (BIRLS and C&P) will be replaced with a new VBA 
 Corporate Database.  Eventually, the VistA HINQ package will be rehosted 
 with a new style user interface application, but in the interim the
 current package will continue to work with the new database.  There are 
 some minor changes that this patch will make in the VistA HINQ package to 
 ensure that HINQ functionality is not affected.  These changes include:
 1.  The HINQ requests will be addressed to a new IP address.  Currently 
 the requests are addressed to one of five regional VBA databases.  Now 
 they will all be directed to the AAC, which will translate messages 
 between VistA and the VBA.
 2.  VBA will no longer limit the number of Service Connected Disabilities 
 it sends in the HINQ responses to six.  VBA will send up to 150 SC 
 Disabilities. Code changes will be made to parse all the Disabilities that
 are sent and allow them to update the VistA database in the PATIENT file
 (#2).
 3.  VBA will no longer be sending several data fields that are currently 
 displayed or printed in the HINQ outputs.  These fields will be removed 
 from all outputs, and there will be no provision for updating VistA 
 through the HINQ for these fields.  The fields are: 
         Disability Indicator
         Combat Disability Indicator
         Diagnostics Verified Indicator
         Additional Service
         Rated Disabilities Verified
         Entitlement Code
         Amt Soc Security (Displayed as Rec'ing SS, file 2, field .36225) 
         Other Ann Retirement - Payee (corresponds to file 2, field .36285)
         Amt Other Ann Retire - Payee (corresponds to file 2, field .3628)
         Amt Other Ann Income - Payee (corresponds to file 2, field .3629)
         Amt Social Security - Spouse
         Other Annual Retirement - Spouse
         Amount Other Ann Retirement - Spouse
         Amount Other Ann Income - Spouse
         Amount Other Ann Income - Spouse
         Master Record Type
         Additional Disabilities
         Hardship Expenses
         Severence Recoupment
         PFOP/FDIB
         Consolidated Payment
         Special Provision
         Special Monthly Compensation
         Diary Date
         Diary Reason
         Nursing Home Indicator
         Competency Payment Factor
         CHAMPVA Indicator
         SSI
 4.  HINQ will display the data field Income For VA Purposes in lieu of 
 the individual income fields that have been eliminated.  It will be 
 displayed on Update Screen 5.  Screen 6, which displayed the income 
 information will no longer display.
 5.  Since eventually all responses will be sent from the new Corporate 
 database, outputs will no longer distinguish between the different 
 database sources.
 6.  Input template [DVBHINQ UPDATE] is modified to eliminate the display 
 and editing of Update Screen 6 and to display the Rated Disability 
 fields (see item #13 below).
 7.  Print template [DVBHINQ PAT-HINQ COMP] is modified to eliminate the 
 individual income fields.
 8.  Expected values for SSN Verified, Adaptive Equipment, Vet 
 Married to Vet, Child Status have changed. These fields are displayed only
 within the context of the HINQ. The values reflect their values on the VBA
 database. 
 9.  It was discovered during testing that there are values in
 the VBA Loss of Use table that are not included in the VistA ANATOMICAL -
 LOSS CODE file (#395.2).  These values will be added in the
 post-installation routine DVB4049P. 
 10. Individual Direct HINQs by patient name will no longer be permitted.  
 (Patient File Individual HINQs will still work as they do currently.)  The
 screen for entering a direct HINQ will no longer have a prompt for name.
 The user will be given a choice of entering the Claim Number, Social
 Security Number or Service Number. An example of the new and old screens
 appears below.
  
 (old screen)
  Select Input: (P)atient File, or (D)irect  P//D
  
  Veterans Name : 
 Social Security: nnnnnnnnn
   Claim Number : 
 Service Number : 
      OK  ? Yes//   (Yes)
 Enter HINQ PASSWORD: 
  
  
 (new screen)
  Select Input: (P)atient File, or (D)irect  P//D
  
 Enter one of the following numbers - Social Security Number, Claim Number
 or Service Number.
  
 Social Security: 123456789
      OK  ? Yes//   (Yes)
 Enter HINQ PASSWORD: 
  
 If the SSN is not entered a prompt for Claim Number will display.  If a 
 Claim Number is not entered the prompt for Service Number will display.
  
 11. The help text displayed if a user enters '??' at the 
  Select Input: (P)atient File, or (D)irect  P//
 prompt in the Individual HINQ Request [DVB HREQ-INDIVHREQ] option is 
 changed.
  
 (old help text)
 Input from the 'P'atient File only requires you to select a Patient Name.
 'D'irect input will prompt for Name, Social Security, Claim Number
 and Service Number.  You may enter Patients not in the Patient file.
 Direct input will not enter Patients in the Patient File.
 Enter '^' to quit
  
 (new help text)
 Input from the 'P'atient File only requires you to select a Patient Name.
  'D'irect input will prompt for Social Security Number, Claim Number or 
 Service Number.
 You may enter Patients not in the Patient file.
 Direct input will not enter Patients in the Patient File.
  
 12. If a site is not up to date with HINQ patches there is a chance that 
 the VBA HINQ response will contain a code that does not have an entry in 
 the local DISABILITY CONDITIONS file (#31).  If this occurs a message 
 will display text shown below suggesting the user notify the ADPAC.  The
 ADPAC should ask the IRM support person to check that all HINQ patches
 have been installed.  Any valid codes in the same record will be added to 
 the VistA record.
  
 (new text displayed)
 Disability code 4444 is missing from this site's DISABILITY
 CONDITIONS file (#13).  4444 not updated to VistA.  Check with ADPAC.
 Hit any key to continue:
  
 13. Several new fields pertaining to the Service Connected Disabilities 
 have been added.  Effective Date of Combined SC% Evaluation will be 
 displayed.  For each individual disability the fields Exremity Affected,
 Original Effective Date and Current Effective Date have been added.  
 Using the HINQUP functionality VistA users will be able to update these 
 fields at the same time as the existing Disability information by 
 selecting "3" or "ALL" at the edit prompt on HINQUP screen 3.  The new 
 fields will also display on Registration screen 11.  
  
 14.  The existing HINQ security requirements maintained in VistA will not 
 change.  VBA is instituting a Common Security Service (CSS) access table
 in it's database to keep track of authorized users. To ensure that all
 HINQ users receive access to the HINQ system the following requirements
 are listed below:
  
  - All users are required to have a VBA BDN Password and a VistA HINQ 
    security key (employee number)
  - Users are required to access HINQ at least once every 90 days to avoid 
    having the system locking them out
  - If a user has not accessed his/her HINQ account after 90 days an error 
    code message will automatically appear preventing the user from access 
    to HINQ
  - In the event that a user is denied access at any time the user is 
    required to contact the VBA ISO coordinator
  - All users are responsible for following-up with their VBA ISO 
    coordinator in expediting all access requests
  - All new and current employees are required to complete a VAF 20-8824e
    form and forward it to their VBA ISO coordinator to ensure access to 
    the HINQ system.
