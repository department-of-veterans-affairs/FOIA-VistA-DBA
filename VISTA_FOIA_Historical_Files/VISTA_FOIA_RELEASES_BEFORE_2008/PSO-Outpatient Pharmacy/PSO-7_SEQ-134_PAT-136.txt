Associated patches: (v)XT*7.3*73   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*136'

Subject: PATIENT MERGE CORRECTIONS;PRESCRIPTION FILE CLEAN-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Problem: 
  ========
  
    The Patient Merge process was not updating entries in the PRESCRIPTION 
    file (#52) with the new patient's internal entry number (IEN).
  
  Solution:
  =========
  
    The Patient Merge patch XT*7.3*73 fixed this problem to appropriately
    update the PATIENT field (#2) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for
    future patient merges. Patch PSO*7*136 has an environment check routine
    PSOPI136 to update this field with the correct patient's internal
    entry number ("merged to").  At the completion of this job, a MailMan
    message with the subject "PSO*7*136 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) - Patient
    Merge clean up", will be sent to the installer notifying the start
    time and time of completion.  The message will provide a list of
    prescriptions with the corrected patient's internal entry number.
    It will also list prescriptions that had the Computerized Patient
    Record System (CPRS) status adjusted to match the Pharmacy status.
