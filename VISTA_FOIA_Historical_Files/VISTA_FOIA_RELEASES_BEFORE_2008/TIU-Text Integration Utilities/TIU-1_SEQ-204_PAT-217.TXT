Subject: CHECK ID CHILD NOTES BEFORE DELETING DOCUMENT IN CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The TIU AUTHORIZATION RPC does not check to see if a document has an
 Interdisciplinary Child attached before deleting. This can cause an
 orphaned ID note. This patch will change the RPC to check on this
 condition. If the document has an attached ID child note then the 
 document will not be deleted and message will be displayed letting the 
 user know why.
  
 This patch addresses PSI-05-100 and PSI-06-030. 
  
 Note:
 Parent ID note with a Child ID note can still be deleted but you must
 disassociate the the Child from the Parent by selecting Action/Detach
 from Interdisciplinary Notes option.
