Subject: CORRECT UNKNOWN USER ON ACT LOG/REMOVE EXTRA DASH LINES 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following two issues.
      
 #1 - When utilizing Voice Recognition/Dictation software 
 (such as Talk Station or Power Scribe) to create an 
 addendum, the users are seeing an incorrect Computer User 
 on the Report Activity Log.
      
 #2 -When printing Radiology Order Requests, extra dash 
 lines are printing in the report.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1
 -------
 Voice recognition/dictation software (such as Talk Station 
 or Power Scribe) allows a radiologist to amend a verified report.
 When an amendment takes place, the Vista Radiology's Report Activity
 Log shows an incorrect entry, "Unknown", in the Computer User 
 column for "REPORT UNVERIFIED".
      
 If the site uses a multi-listener port, the Report Activity Log shows 
 "Unknown" for the Computer User.  If the site uses a single listener 
 port, the same log will display the name of the person who started 
 the single listener background job (person that started the Voice 
 Recognition Product to a Vista HL7 link) as the one who un-verified 
 the report.
      
 The correct display should show the person that un-verified the 
 report to be the same person that verified the report.
           
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RARTE1 to sense if the 
 report being unverified is coming from Voice Recognition/Dictation
 software.  If so, the Computer User field in the Report Activity Log for
 the unverified data will be set to the person that verified the report.
  
         
 Problem #2     
 -------
 The Print Selected Requests by Patient [RA ORDERPRINTPAT] option 
 will print extra dash lines at the end of the report if the request was 
 created by CPRS and has not yet been registered.
           
 Resolution #2
 ----------     
 A modification will be made to routine RAORD61 to no longer 
 print the extra dash lines.
