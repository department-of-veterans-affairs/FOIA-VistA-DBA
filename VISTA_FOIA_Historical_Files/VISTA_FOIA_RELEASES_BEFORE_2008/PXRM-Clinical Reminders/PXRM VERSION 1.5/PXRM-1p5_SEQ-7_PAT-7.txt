 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch provides new functionality for Clinical Reminders that will help
 sites meet the mandate to collect Military Sexual Trauma (MST) data.
 For background information on MST and detailed installation and setup
 instructions see the Installation and Setup Guide for this patch.
  
 NOTE: If your site is currently capturing MST data via health factors, 
 education topics, or exams, it is critical you review the installation and 
 setup steps with the Clinical Application Coordinator or person responsible 
 for the functionality of this reminder, PRIOR to installing the patch.   
 The decision to rename local terms to the national terms OR to maintain the 
 local terms and then map them to the national terms needs to be made PRIOR 
 to the patch install. See remaining of patch description for details as 
 well as the MST Clinical Reminder Installation and Setup Guide for 
 PXRM*1.5*7.
  
 Included with this patch is a new reminder definition, VA-MST SCREENING,
 and the findings used by the definition. The findings include three
 reminder terms: MST DECLINES REPORT, MST NEGATIVE REPORT, and MST POSITIVE
 REPORT; two computed findings: VA-MST STATUS and VA-VETERAN; and four health
 factors: MST CATEGORY, MST DECLINES TO ANSWER, MST NO DOES NOT REPORT, and
 MST YES REPORTS. Finally, there is a reminder dialog: VA-MST SCREENING. 
  
 The reminder dialog has three elements which update PCE with health factor
 findings (MST NO DOES NOT REPORT, MST YES REPORTS and MST DECLINES TO ANSWER).
 Individual elements in the reminder dialog may be modified to use local
 findings.
  
 When CPRS GUI v17 (patch OR*3.0*116) or higher is installed you will be
 able to capture data directly to the MST HISTORY file (#29.11) using this
 reminder dialog.
  
 If your site is already capturing MST data via health factors, education
 topics, or exams, there is functionality in this patch that will help you
 synchronize this data with the data in the MST HISTORY file (#29.11).
 Before the synchronization can be done you must map the three reminder
 terms to your local findings. See the Setup and Maintenance section of the
 Clinical Reminders MST Functionality Installation and Setup Guide for
 detailed instructions. If you have been using health factors that are
 similar to those listed above you may consider renaming your health
 factors to match the names listed above. The renaming must be done BEFORE
 this patch is installed or it will not work. If you choose not to do this,
 or your site has been using education topics or exams, you will need to
 map your findings to these terms before the initial synchronization can be
 done.
  
 After installation of this patch you will find a new option on the
 Reminder Managers Menu called Reminders MST Synchronization Management.
 There are two options on this menu: one for doing the synchronization
 (Reminders MST Synchronization), and one for checking on the
 synchronization (Reminders MST Synchronization Report). The first option
 allows you to schedule a background job that does the synchronization. If
 you answer "y" to the question "Do you want to run the MST synchronization
 at the same time every day?" then a synchronization job will run 
 automatically every day. The report option gives you data on the initial
 synchronization and the last daily synchronization.
  
 The VA-MST SCREENING reminder has dual sponsorship. This patch changes
 the REMINDER SPONSOR file (#811.6) and the Sponsor management tools to
 accommodate this. A Sponsor for an individual item may consist of a list
 of associated sponsors. Fields to store contact information (name, phone
 number, etc.) are now available in the REMINDER SPONSOR file.
  
 An enhancement to dialog edit is also included in this patch. If a reminder
 dialog or dialog group is deleted within the Reminder Dialog option then any
 components of the dialog which are not used elsewhere will be listed and the
 option given to delete all these components.
  
 In addition to support for MST, this patch provides fixes to some problems
 raised on several NOIS messages.
  
 1. In some cases error messages were being sent to the user even if a
 mail group to receive the errors was defined. The user will no longer
 receive the error message. NOIS FAR-0701-40609.
  
 2. An undefined variable error may occur when using the Exchange
 Utility to install a Reminder Sponsor. The problem is fixed by this
 patch. NOIS HIN-0901-40428.
  
 3. An undefined variable error may occur when using the Exchange Utility to 
 install a Mental Health Instrument finding. The problem is fixed by this 
 patch. NOIS DEN-0901-52465.
  
 4. When adding 3 months to the date 10/01/2001 the result came back as 
 13/1/2001. This problem is fixed by this patch. NOIS ALB-1001-50136, 
 HIN-1101-41689, MAC-1001-60088.
  
 5. In the Exchange Utility if you selected the IA (install all) action and 
 did a quit, then returned to the IA it would immediately quit. This problem 
 is fixed by this patch. NOIS HIN-1101-41310.
    
 6. If a reminder dialog is exchanged with an orderable item and the 
 orderable item does not exist on the target system the option is now given 
 to delete from the dialog, replace with local orderable items or quit 
 before the dialog component is installed. NOIS ISA-1101-10704.
  
 7. In certain cases the Exchange Utility would not correctly read to the
 end of the host file. This was fixed. NOIS DAY-1001-40760.
  
 8. An input transform was being executed during an Exchange Utility 
 install when it should not have been. The code was changed so the input 
 tranform is not executed. NOIS UNY-1001-12245.

  Documentation:
  ==============
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
  patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
 may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 This documentation will be in the form of an Adobe Acrobat file:
 PXRMIG-P7.PDF (Clinical Reminders MST Functionality Installation and Setup
 Guide). The documentation can also be found on the System Design and
 Development Web page: (http://vista.med.va.gov/vdl/).
