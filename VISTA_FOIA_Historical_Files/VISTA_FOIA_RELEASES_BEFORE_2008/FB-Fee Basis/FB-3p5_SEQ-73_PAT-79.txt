 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch addresses the problem encountered when the DATE OF SERVICE is 
 entered for an outpatient or ancillary payment(FEE BASIS PAYMENT #162 
 file), the software will inappropriately skip the validation checks when 
 there is already data on file for the same PATIENT, VENDOR, and INITIAL 
 TREATMENT DATE (date of service).

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. ISW-0404-21540     Date of Service Not Always Checked
  
 Problem:
 -------
 
 This problem can be seen with the Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER 
 PAYMENT] option.  The date check for the date of service is built into 
 the data dictionary (it is called by the input transform on the field).  
 When you enter the date of service you may be entering a new date for 
 that veteran and vendor or you may be selecting an existing date for the
 veteran and vendor.  If it is a new date, the input transform is executed
 and the date check occurs.  If you select an existing date (does not have
 to be on the same invoice - just needs to be for same veteran and vendor
 in file 162) then the input transform does not execute and the date check
 does not occur.
  
 At the Date of Service prompt, you can enter a "?" to get a list of dates 
 that have already been entered for the veteran and vendor.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 
 In general FILEMAN does not call the INPUT TRANSFORM of a field if it 
 already exist, as in this case.  The Date of Service date exists but the 
 Invoice dates are new. The INPUT TRANSFORM is on the Date of Service not 
 the new Invoice date. So code was added after going to FILEMAN. If the 
 INPUT TRANSFORM was not activated by FILEMAN then the code edits the 
 dates and issues the same error responses as the INPUT TRANSFORM would if 
 the dates do not comply.
