Subject: CP National Database to Facility VistA Monitor

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. This patch adds the VistA Monitor program to the CM Tools application.
    The Capacity Planning National Database will send a message to each 
    Vista facility at a pre-determined time frame (ex: every 20 minutes).
    In turn, each facility will respond with a message back to the CP
    national database.  This data will be used to determine which sites are
    up and running, and which sites may be experiencing down-time.
  
    The option Edit CP Parameters File [KMPD PARAM EDIT] has been updated
    to include three additional fields:
  
    Scheduled Down Time Start
    Scheduled Down Time Stop
    Reason for Down Time
  
    Dates and times entered into these fields will be taken into 
    consideration, and the facility will not be considered 'down' during 
    this time frame.
    
 2. The date in the subject line of CP TIMING messages is being changed 
    from Mar 29, 2006 to 3/29/06.  Because of some site names being long, 
    the end of the subject was being cut off.
  
 The following routines are included in this patch. The second line of 
 the routines now look like:
