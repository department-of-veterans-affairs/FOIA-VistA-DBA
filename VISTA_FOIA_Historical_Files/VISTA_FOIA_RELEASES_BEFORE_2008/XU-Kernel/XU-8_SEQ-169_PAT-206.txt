Description: 
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide the sites with utilities that
 facilitate the clean up of the INSTITUTION (#4) file, to populate the
 local INSTITUTION (#4) file with a complete list of national facilities 
 with station number, to implement a Master File Server mechanism that
 maintains national Institution entries automatically, to modify the
 INSTITUTION (#4) file Data Dictionary preventing local editing of national
 data and adding historical time sensitive data fields, and to provide
 Application Programmer Interface to return Institution and Institution
 time sensitive information.
  
  
 The clean up and the national file - Institution Master File
 =============================================================
  
 The clean up utilities will provide several lists to compare the local
 INSTITUTION (#4) file with the Institution Master File (IMF) -- the "gold"
 file of Institutions complete with all approved station numbers including
 inactive as well as active station numbers.  Utilities will be included to
 resolve duplicate station numbers and to automatically populate the local
 INSTITUTION (#4) file with national IMF data.
  
 The INSTITUTION (#4) file clean up utilities utilize the query functionality
 provided by the Master File Server mechanism implemented with this patch.
 The data is returned to the local site that stores the IMF data in a
 temporary global.  The clean up utilities use this information for 
 comparing and displaying the data, as well as automatically updating the
 local INSTITUTION (#4) file.
  
 The Institution Master File (IMF) is made up of information collected from
 the VISNs by the Office of Policy and Planning, the official spreadsheet of
 station numbers distributed by Central Office, and information provided by
 the Austin Automation Center and the National DataBase Integration (NDBI)
 team.
  
 The clean up utilities are presented to the user via a List Manager interface.
 The main List Manager screen displays INSTITUTION (#4) file vs. IMF file data.
 There are several actions associated with this main screen. They are 
 'Delete local/dup. station #', 'List local station numbers',
 'List national data to merge', 'Auto update with national data', and 
 'Required clean-up actions'.
  
 Main Screen:  Name list.  INSTITUTION (#4) file vs. IMF
 -------------------------------------------------------
 This main screen displays a side-by-side view of the current INSTITUTION (#4)
 file and its corresponding IMF entry sorted by station number.
 Note some lines may not have both an INSTITUTION (#4) name and IMF name.
 The reasons why there may not be an entry in both columns are: station
 numbers in the INSTITUTION (#4) file not in the IMF or IMF entries missing
 from the INSTITUTION (#4) file (see 'List local station numbers' and 'List
 national data to merge').  Since the purpose of this list is to compare the
 local file vs. the IMF (sorted by station number), if duplicate station
 numbers in the local file exist they are not displayed twice.  The 
 'Delete local/dup. station #' action is used to fix/view these duplicates.
  
 Actions of the Main List Manager Screen
 =======================================
  
 List local station numbers
 --------------------------
 This action checks for and displays any station numbers that are found in the
 INSTITUTION (#4) file but are not included in the IMF.  These local station 
 numbers are automatically deleted by the 'Delete local/dup. station #' 
 associated action.  You may run this list prior to 'Delete local/dup. 
 station #' to view local station numbers that will be deleted.
  
 ***Note: The 'Delete local/dup. station #' action will remove these
 local station numbers.
  
 A new cross-reference ^DIC(4,"AOLD99",IEN,station_number) will exist for
 deleted STATION NUMBER (#99).
  
 Delete local/dup. station #
 ---------------------------
 This action will first remove any local STATION NUMBER (#99) from the
 INSTITUTION (#4) file.  It then checks for any duplicate station numbers.
 For each set of duplicates, the action checks if one entry in the set is
 pointed to by the LOGICAL LINK (#870) file; if so, that entry is kept and
 the value of the STATION NUMBER (#99) field of the other duplicate entries
 are deleted.  If any set of duplicates remain (the set having no pointer
 from file #870), the action then displays them.  The display lists line
 number, station number, institution name, and the internal entry number of
 the INSTITUTION (#4) file entry.  An action is associated with this list
 to automatically delete the duplicate station number by selecting the line
 number of the entry to be affected; this deletion is of the STATION NUMBER
 (#99) field and not the INSTITUTION (#4) file entry itself.
  
 Since the INSTITUTION (#4) file is referenced by numerous packages, there
 is probably no one correct entry to select for station number deletion --
 for those entries where the NAME (#.01) does not clearly indicate the 
 correct choice.  The important thing is to resolve the duplicate.  If a
 problem in a specific package should arise, that issue may have to be dealt
 with on a case-by-case basis.  The patch does implement an API,
 $$O99^XUAF4(IEN), and cross-reference, "O99", that may be used to resolve
 (re-point) any package specific issues.  See below for more information 
 about the API and cross-reference.
  
 All duplicate stations numbers must be resolved before the 'Auto update
 with national data' action will allow the site to auto update their
 INSTITUTION (#4) file with the IMF data.
  
 Any STATION NUMBER (#99) that is automatically deleted will be displayed
 in the Action Area of the List Manager screen to denote processing.  To get
 a proper list of local station numbers to be deleted, use the action
 'List local station numbers' PRIOR to running this action!  The duplicate
 station numbers that are auto-resolved in favor of the file #870 pointer 
 are only displayed in the Action Area following the listing of deleted 
 local station numbers (with associated DIR End-Of-Page prompt).  This is 
 the only place these type of duplicates are listed, although, all deleted 
 STATION NUMBER (#99) field values are stored in a new cross-reference.
  
 A new cross-reference ^DIC(4,"AOLD99",IEN,station_number) will exist for
 any deleted STATION NUMBER (#99).
  
 ******Note: If the site's own STATION NUMBER (#99) is duplicate then
 extreme caution must be exercised when selecting the entry to delete the
 STATION NUMBER (#99) from since the INSTITUTION (#4) file is referenced by
 other standard files such as HL LOGICAL LINK (#870), MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION
 (#40.8), and STATION NUMBER (TIME SENSITIVE) (#389.9).  These file entries
 should be checked before and after performing the clean up to verify they
 point to a valid Institution entry, complete with station number.
  
 Also note, other applications including AMIE, Record Tracking, and CIRN 
 MPI/PD may be negatively affected if their pointers to an INSTITUTION (#4)
 file entry don't have a valid STATION NUMBER (#99). ***********
  
 List national data to merge
 ---------------------------
 This action checks for and displays any station numbers that are in the IMF
 but not found in the INSTITUTION (#4) file.  This list is informational only
 and has no actions associated with it.  Sites may wish to print this list
 before running 'Auto update with national data' to see which entries will
 be added to the INSTITUTION (#4) file.
  
 Auto update with national data
 ------------------------------
 This action will automatically update the INSTITUTION (#4) file with IMF
 data.  This action will first check for duplicate station numbers.  If any
 duplicates are found the action will notify the user and suspend the update
 until the duplicates are resolved (see 'Delete local/dup. station #').
 If no duplicate station numbers are found the update begins.  First it will
 clean out any data stored in the *STATION NAME (#7) field and then remove
 any local station numbers stored in STATION NUMBER (#99) field; only
 nationally approved station numbers are allowed.  Any entry with a STATUS
 (#11) of INACTIVE will have the INACTIVE FACILITY FLAG (#101) set and the
 STATUS (#11) field value deleted.  Next it will merge the IMF data with the
 site's INSTITUTION (#4) file; this includes setting the STATUS (#11) flag
 to national, and populating the fields NAME (#.01), STATION NUMBER (#99),
 OFFICIAL VA NAME (#100), FACILITY TYPE (#13), and STATE (#2).  Inactive
 facilities and deactivated station numbers will have the INACTIVE FACILITY
 FLAG (#101) set.  Integrated/realigned facilities will have a pointer to/from
 the new/old INSTITUTION (#4) file entry together with the effective date; 
 these values will be stored in the HISTORY (#4.999) sub-file fields 
 EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01), REALIGNED TO (#.05), and REALIGNED FROM (#.06).
  
 The auto update action will take approximately 5-10 minutes and the 
 terminal will hang until complete.  This should complete the clean up, but
 run the action 'Required clean-up actions' to verify there are no further 
 duplicates and that all IMF data merged correctly.
  
 Required clean-up actions
 -------------------------
 This action may be run at any time to determine which steps are required to
 successfully complete the INSTITUTION (#4) file clean up.  It first checks
 for duplicate station numbers and any missing IMF data.  If any discrepancies
 are found, they are displayed with the appropriate resolving action.  If no
 discrepancies are found, the user will be notified the update is complete.
  
 The following new components are provided for the clean up:

 Master File Server mechanism
 ============================
  
 Once the clean up has been performed and the local INSTITUTION (#4) file 
 merged with Institution Master File data from FORUM, further updates to 
 the INSTITUTION (#4) file are handled automatically by the Master File 
 Server mechanism.
  
 The administrator will receive update notifications such as new CBOC station 
 numbers directly from the Information Management Service via the 045A4 
 distribution list.
  
 The administrator will then add/edit the INSTITUTION (#4) file entry on
 FORUM.  This will result in the building of an HL7 message containing the 
 update, which will be sent to all VistA sites.  The message will be processed
 automatically at the sites, updating the local INSTITUTION (#4) file with
 the new/updated entry.

 Data Dictionary modifications
 =============================
  
 INSTITUTION (#4) file
 ---------------------
  
 The STATUS (#11) field will have 'INACTIVE' removed from the set of codes.  
 Inactive entries will now be flagged by the INACTIVE FACILITY FLAG (#101)
 field.  The input transform has been modified to prevent setting of the
 STATUS (#11) field to national.  Only national entries may be flagged as 
 NATIONAL and only by the IMF cleanup or server mechanism.  A site can not
 create national entries or flag local entries as national.
  
 The STATION NUMBER (#99) field will be modified to prevent any local 
 updating.  The STATION NUMBER (#99) field is reserved for national entries
 only.  The STATION NUMBER (#99) field will be maintained by the Master File
 Server mechanism.
  
 The NAME (#.01) field will be modified to prevent the editing of this
 field for national entries.
  
 The STATE (#.02) field will be modified to prevent the editing of this 
 field for national entries.
  
 The FACILITY TYPE (#13) field will be modified to prevent the editing of 
 this field for national entries.
  
 The OFFICAL VA NAME (#100) field will be increased from a maximum of 30 
 characters of free text to 80 characters.  This is to allow for the longer
 new health care system names.  This field will also be modified to prevent 
 the editing of national entries.
  
 The INACTIVE FACILITY FLAG (#101) field will have set of codes changed from 
 'Y' for 'YES' to '1' for 'INACTIVE'.  This field will also be modified to 
 prevent the editing of national entries.
  
 A new HISTORY (#999.1) multiple field has been added with the following 
 fields:
  
   EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) - The effective date of the historical event.
  
   NAME (CHANGED FROM) (#.02) - If the NAME changed, this field holds the 
 #.01 value prior to the edit on the effective date.
  
   OFFICIAL VA NAME (CHANGED FROM) (#.03) - If the OFFICAL VA NAME changed,
 this field holds the #100 value prior to the edit on the effective date.
  
   REALIGNED TO (#.05) - This field holds a pointer to the INSTITUTION (#4) 
 file entry with the new STATION NUMBER (#99) for this facility.
  
   REALIGNED FROM (#.06) - This field holds a pointer to the INSTITUTION (#4) 
 file entry with the old STATION NUMBER (#99) for this facility.
  
   DEACTIVATED FACILITY / STA # (#.07) - This field flags (1) a deactivated
 facility and/or station number for this effective date.
  
   ACTIVATED FACILITY (#.08) - This field flags (1) a re-activated
 facility and/or station number for this effective date.
  
 Four new write identifiers are added with the patch and replace the current 
 field identifiers.  The post-init routine XUMFPOST deletes the old field 
 identifiers.  The new write identifiers are state, facility type, station 
 number, and inactive facility flag with effective date.
  
 The post-init will also remove the following deprecated (starred) fields:
  
   *OUTPUT HEADER (#.04)
   *STATION NAME (#7)
   *MAILMAN FLAG (#12)
   *OLD AMIS NUMBER (#77)
   *G&L HEADER (#10)
   *PACKAGE X-REF (#30) subfile
  
 FACILITY TYPE (#4.1) file
 -------------------------
  
 A STATUS (#3) field is added.  This field is a set of codes.  'N' flags 
 'National' and 'L' flags 'Local' entries.
  
  
 Application Programmer Interface
 ================================
  
 $$IEN^XUAF4(STA) - returns the INSTITUTION (#4) file IEN for a given
 station number
  
 $$STA^XUAF4(IEN) - returns the station number for a given INSTITUTION (#4) 
 file IEN.
  
 $$TF^XUAF4(IEN) - is this an active treating facility (1=YES,0=NO) for a
 given INSTITUTION (#4) file IEN?
  
 $$RT^XUAF4(IEN) - returns the realigned to 'IEN^station number^date' for a 
 given INSTITUTION (#4) file IEN
  
 $$RF^XUAF4(IEN) - returns the realigned from 'IEN^station number^date' for a 
 given INSTITUTION (#4) file IEN

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 The patch can be installed at anytime.  Install time should not take more
 than two minutes.  The actual clean up, using the List Manager utilities,
 will take additional time.  Since the INSTITUTION (#4) file is a standard
 file referenced by many packages, it is recommended to perform the clean
 up with as few users on the system as possible; this includes the auto 
 update and delete duplicate station number actions.  The lists can be
 run at any time.  Resolving any duplicate entries is interactive and will
 vary site to site.  The auto update action should take five to ten minutes.
  
 Note: The clean up code queries the Master File Server on FORUM to get a 
 copy of the Institution Master File.  The HL7 package checks whether a 
 message is intended for production or training.  The FORUM server's HL7
 site parameter is 'production', so attempting to install this patch in a 
 test account with the site parameter set to 'training' will result in a 
 response message containing an 'Application Reject' due to 'Processing ID 
 Mismatch with Site Parameters'.
  
 Before installing the patch, make a copy of the INSTITUTION (#4) file. 
  
   Use ^%GTO (DSM) (for Cache use %GO) to save a copy of the INSTITUTION (#4)
   file for backup purposes.  Following is an example:
  
     VAH>D ^%GTO
  
     This routine saves globals to be restored by %GTI
  
     Output Device ?  > DIC4.GBL
  
     Header comment... INSTITUTION (#4) file backup
     global(s) ? > ^DIC(4
     global(s) ? > ^DIC(4.1
     global(s) ? > ^
  
     Global(s) Selected:
        ^DIC(4)
  
     Output started for ^DIC at 8:19:50 AM
  
     Global transfer finished at 8:19:51 AM
  
     VAH>
  
 In the event of some unforeseen disaster the site decides they need to back
 out of the clean up, the site may 'KILL ^DIC(4),^DIC(4.1' and DO ^%GTI (DSM)
 (for Cache use DO ^%GI) to restore the backup copy.  This will restore the
 data to its original state.
  
 1.  Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
  
 2.  DSM/AXP sites: These routines are not usually mapped, so you will
 probably not have to disable mapping. 
  
 3.  You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 4.  Use the "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" option on the PackMan menu. This loads 
 the patch into a Transport Global onto your system. 
  
 5.  On the KIDS menu, select the "Installation" menu and use the following 
 options to install the Transport Global: 
  
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System

 7.  DSM/AXP Sites:  If the routines were unmapped per STEP #2, the mapped 
 set should be rebuilt once the installation has run to completion.
  
 8.  Delete the post-init routine XUMFPOST and the environment check routine
 XUMFENV.  DO NOT delete any other XUMF* routines!
  
 9.  Add members to the XUMF INSTITUTION mail group who should be notified 
 of any new station numbers added to the INSTITUTION (#4) file (IRM, PIMS 
 ADPACs, etc).
  
 10.  Add members to the XUMF SERVER mail group who should be notified of 
 any server bulletins.  These bulletins may include error messages related 
 to the server mechanism and may require intervention by IRM.
  
 Post Install Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 1.  Add the option Institution File Query / Update [XUMF INSTITUTION] to
 the Kernel Management Menu [XUKERNEL].  Optional.
  
 2.  Select the Institution File Query / Update option in the Kernel
 Management Menu.  Several short messages will be displayed on your screen,
 and then the terminal will hang 5-10 minutes while the option gets a copy
 of the Institution Master File from FORUM.  When the query response message 
 arrives the main List Manager display will appear on your screen (see the 
 beginning of this patch description for more details).
  
 3.  Run the 'List local station numbers' list (LLCL) to get a list of the
 local station numbers that will be deleted from the STATION NUMBER (#99)
 field.  Use the List Manager common Action 'PL' to get a printed copy of
 the list.
  
 4.  Run (optionally) the 'List national data to merge' (NATL) to get a list
 of data to be merged to the INSTITUTION (#4) file.
  
 5.  Run the 'Delete local/dup. station #' action (DSTA).  If any duplicates
 remain (not auto-resolved by 'Delete local/dup. station #') use the
 list and associated action 'Resolve duplicate station numbers' to fix 
 remaining duplicates manually.  See the description of 'Delete local/dup. 
 station #' for more information.
  
 6.  Run the 'Auto update with national data' action (AUTO).
  
 7.  Run the 'Required clean-up actions' action (CHCK).
 If actions are displayed, run the appropriate actions and repeat step 6.
 If not, congratulations!  You're done.
