Subject: Help Frames Loop

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  Occasionally users would get stuck in a loop when viewing help
  frames.  XQH4 has been modified to prevent this from happening.
  
  This problem was reported by CIOFO developers while testing MailMan
  patch XM*7.1*50.  It will become a required patch for XM*7.1*50.
  
 ============================================================================
  ROUTINES:
     Checksums obtained using CHECK^XTSUMBLD
     The second line of the routine now looks like:
         ;;8.0;KERNEL;**[patch list]**;Jul 10, 1995
  
              Before          After           Patch

 =============================================================================
  INSTALLATION:
  
    1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
  
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the
        Transport global.
  
    4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and 
        installed at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
  
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3  Print Transport Global
           4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5  Backup a Transport Global
  
    6.  As with the installation of all Kernel patches, it is recommended
        that you return to programmers prompt and use 'D ^XPDKRN':
          Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                              =======
          Install Package(s)
          Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*113
                               ==========
  
    7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
