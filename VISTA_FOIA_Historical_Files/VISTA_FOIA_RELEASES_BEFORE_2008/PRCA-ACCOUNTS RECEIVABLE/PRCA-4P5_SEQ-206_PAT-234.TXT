Subject: RESCHEDULING CBO EXTRACT HISTORICAL TRANSMISSIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch, PRCA*4.5*228, set up historical data transmissions to be sent to 
 the Allocation Resource Center (ARC).  These data transmissions were 
 sent with 3 months of data for each transmission.  This was found to be 
 impractical because of the amount of data being transferred.  This patch 
 reschedules the transmissions to send 1 month of data per transmission.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Prior to installing the patch, all current historical FTP transmissions 
 that are running should be stopped, all future tasks of these jobs
 should be deleted, and the batch file entries removed from the AR Data 
 Queue file (#348.4).
  
 The revised tasks are scheduled during the post-init.
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
 There are no options to disable.  Users may remain on the system. 
  
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes
  
  
 ************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 1.  Stop the historical transmissions currently running.
  
 Review the VMS queues and find any entries with a "Jobname" of RCXVCBO.  
 Make note of the entry numbers for these jobs and then delete the entries 
 from the VMS queue.  The following is an example of deleting one entry:
  
 $ SHOW QUEUE/ALL/BATCH/FULL
