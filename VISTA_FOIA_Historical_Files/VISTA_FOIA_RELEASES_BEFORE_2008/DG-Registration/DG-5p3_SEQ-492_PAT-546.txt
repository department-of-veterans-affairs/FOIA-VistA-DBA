 NOIS Overview:      
 ==============
 1. V07-0102-N0032   error at en+31 dgrp1
      
 Problem
 -------
 A standardization issue was discovered when a file pointer issue was not
 handled in the same manner by both the pre-reg and reg software -- pre-reg
 would error out with an UNDEF while reg would display 'UNKNOWN.'
    
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to a pre-reg routine (DGRP1) to check for the  
 existence of data so there is no error and return an "UNKNOWN" if a file   
 pointer problem exists on patient demographic data screen <1> in pre-reg.
   
  
 2. EKH-0600-41137   SSN FIELD AND PRIMARY LONG ID DO NOT MATCH
  
 Problem
 -------
 The Primary Long and Primary Short ID's not updating properly when 
 The SSN is changed using DG REGISTRATION MENU Load/Edit Patient Data
 ([DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]).  When updating the SSN in Load/Edit and the 
 patient is registered with an eligibility code of TriCare/Champus various 
 registration screens will display the old/wrong SSN (long or short)
 because of a missing piece of data on the TriCare/Champus eligibility 
 code, the ID FORMAT Field (File #8, Field #9) data which should be set 
 to 1-VA Standard.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A routine (DG53546P) will be included in this patch to add the data to the 
 TriCare/Champus eligibility code resolving the problem.  
      
  
 3. MAC-0400-61574    Screen 2 doesn't show   bdj 
  
 Problem
 -------
 Currently when accessing a Tricare Patient through DG Load/Edit screens 
 2&4 are turned off, however screen 2 is available when accessing Tricare
 patients through Eligibility Verification.  Central Office has indicated
 that the two functions should be consistent and the restrictions from
 DG Load/Edit should be removed allowing access to screens 2 and 4 of   
 DG Load/Edit when accessing a TRICARE patient.  
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine DGRPV to allow registration screens
 2 and 4 to appear during registration of a patient with a patient type of 
 Tricare/Champus.
      
  
 4. DAN-0602-41540   Pre-Reg finds cancelled appts
      
 Problem
 -------
 Patients continue to show on the PreRegistration Call list after their
 appointments have been cancelled. (DGPRE DISPLAY CALL LIST).  File 41.42   
 contains patient records that are no longer current.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine ^DGPREP0 to not show patients if
 they have no appointments needing to be called.  I.e., On a go forward 
 basis, patients that have had their appointments cancelled should not 
 show up on the call list.       
 Also, coding changes will be made to remove records from file
 41.42 if the patient no longer has valid, current appointments.
