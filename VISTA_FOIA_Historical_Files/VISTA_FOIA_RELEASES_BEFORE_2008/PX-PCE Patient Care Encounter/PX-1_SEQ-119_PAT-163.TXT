Category:

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 MIW-1204-41479  PCE/SD Debugger 3M display problem
  
  
 Problem:
 -------
   
 When selecting patient using option PCE/SD DEBUGGER the compile
 hangs for minutes and the 3M batch information in the display is for
 many patients other than the selected patient.
  
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Modify routine PXQUTL1 to bypass the 3M batch list for the visit (only
 the encounter) and only list the batch file header when driving upward
 in the file hierarchy (#19908.51) instead of all entries in batch.
