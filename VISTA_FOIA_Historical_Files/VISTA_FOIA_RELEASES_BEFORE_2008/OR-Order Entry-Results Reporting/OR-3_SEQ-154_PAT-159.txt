Description: 
============

 
   This patch adds the patient's race and ethnicity       SRS Race & Ethnicity
   data to the Demographics Report on the CPRS reports    HDS Current Systems,
   tab, under Clinical Reports/Patient Information,       Nov 2002
   and to the Patient Inquiry, using either the 
   existing (old) RACE field (.06) or the new fields      E3R 17162
   RACE INFORMATION (field #2) and ETHNICITY 
   INFORMATION (field #6) added to the patient file 
   #2 with patch DG*5.3*415.  
 
       -  If neither the Ethnicity nor the Race data
          elements exists in the new format, then 
          extract and use the Race data element from
          the old format.
  
       -  If the Ethnicity exist in the new format, 
          and the Race does not exist in the new
          format, display the Ethnicity data element 
          in the new format and display the Race as 
          <null>.
  
       -  If the Race exist in the new format, and 
          the Ethnicity does not exist, then display 
          the Ethnicity as <null> and the Race data 
          element in the new format.
  
       -  If the Ethnicity and Race data elements in
          the new format do not exist, and the Race 
          data element in the old format does not 
          exist, then do not display any Ethnicity or
          Race data.  
 
   The entry point DEMOG^ORQPTQ3(.Y,DFN) has been
   modified to return an up-arrow delimited string 
   containing the following data elements:
 
         SSN
         DOB
         Age
         Sex
         Race         <---- Modified
         Ethnicity    <---- Added
         Religion
         Marital Status
         Provider DUZ;Provider Name
         Attending DUZ;Attending Name
         Hospital Location
         Ward
         Room/Bed
 
   The entry point DEMOG^ORQPTQ3(.Y,DFN) above, is
   not currently called by OERR, nor are there any
   integration agreements to call this entry point.
   It has been changed so that any package that 
   needs to call this entry point in the future
   will retrieve correct data from the newly added
   fields RACE INFORMATION and ETHNICITY INFORMATION.
 
   The demographic data element "Religion" on the         E3R 17650
   Patient Inquiry has been changed from conditional 
   (based on the MAS site parameters) to unconditional
   (always displayed).
   
   The demographic data element "Patient also known as"    E3R 14854
   for patient alias has been added to the Patient
   Inquiry.
   
   Both the Primary and Secondary (when available) are    E3R 17301
   displayed in the Patient Inquiry.
    
   Display the Prescription Mail Delivery status in       E3R 17667
   the Patient Inquiry.

       2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the Routine
           Summary (above) are mapped, then they should be removed from the
           mapped set at this time.
     
       3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
           select the Installation menu.
