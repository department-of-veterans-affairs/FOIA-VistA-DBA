 NOIS OVERVIEW:

 1. HD0000000090025     *Default summary - Rad HL7 Resend Message
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Patch RA*5.0*54 was released on March 17, 2005 to solve a problem with
     the "Resend Radiology HL7 Message" [RA HL7 MESSAGE RESEND] option,
     but it also introduced another problem.  The initial problem fixed, by
     RA*5.0*54, was generated when the user resent more than one case
     without exiting this option.  The cases which should have been resent
     under the RA REG protocol were not resent.  The new problem introduced,
     by RA*5.0*54, occurs when cases are resent under the RA EXAMINED
     protocol.  They are being done so with the wrong order control code of
     "NW", when the correct code should have been "XO".
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     This patch retains the fix of the initial problem while correcting the
     newly introduced problem by using the order control of "XO", instead
     of "NW", for cases sent under the "RA EXAMINED" protocol.

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...

           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)

          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
