"RTN","DVBCWME5",119,0)
 ;;       on the examination report.
"RTN","DVBCWME5",120,0)
 ;;    2. If the diagnosis is changed, explain fully whether the new diagnosis
"RTN","DVBCWME5",121,0)
 ;;       represents a progression of the prior diagnosis or development of a new
"RTN","DVBCWME5",122,0)
 ;;       and separate condition.
"RTN","DVBCWME5",123,0)
 ;;    3. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible

"RTN","DVBCWME5",129,0)
 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
"RTN","DVBCWME5",130,0)
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to
"RTN","DVBCWME5",131,0)
 ;;or is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected disorder, the

 ;;veteran may be entitled to compensation.  See Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d
"RTN","DVBCWME5",133,0)
 ;;1368, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Therefore, it is important to determine the
"RTN","DVBCWME5",134,0)
 ;;relationship, if any, between a service-connected disorder and a disability
"RTN","DVBCWME5",135,0)
 ;;resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.  Unless alcohol or drug
"RTN","DVBCWME5",136,0)
 ;;abuse is secondary to or is caused or aggravated by another mental disorder,
"RTN","DVBCWME5",137,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME5",145,0)
 ;;include the GAF score and note whether it refers to current functioning.
"RTN","DVBCWME5",146,0)
 ;;A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score, that a

 ;;separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when there are
"RTN","DVBCWME5",148,0)
 ;;multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses and not all are service-connected.
"RTN","DVBCWME5",149,0)
 ;;If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and discussion of

 ;;    2. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible

 ;;       the symptoms associated with each and a discussion of relationship.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",41,0)

 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",44,0)

 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",46,0)
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to

"RTN","DVBCWPD7",51,0)
 ;;resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.  Unless alcohol or drug

 ;;J. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF):
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",66,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",67,0)
 ;;    NOTE: The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be required
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",68,0)
 ;;    by BVA REMAND or specifically requested by the rating specialist. If so,
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",69,0)
 ;;    include the GAF score and note whether it refers to current functioning.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",70,0)
 ;;    A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score,
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",71,0)
 ;;    that a separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",72,0)
 ;;    there are multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses and not all are service-
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",73,0)
 ;;    connected. If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",74,0)
 ;;    discussion of the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an explanation
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",75,0)
 ;;    as to why not is needed. (See the above note pertaining to alcohol or drug

 ;;K. CAPACITY TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",79,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",80,0)
 ;;       Mental competency, for VA benefits purposes, refers only to the ability

 ;;       of the veteran to manage VA benefit payments in his or her own best
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",82,0)
 ;;       interest, and not to any other subject. Mental incompetency,
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",83,0)
 ;;       for VA benefits purposes, means that the veteran, because of injury
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",84,0)
 ;;       or disease, is not capable of managing benefit payments in his or her
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",85,0)
 ;;       best interest. In order to assist raters in making a legal determination
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",86,0)
 ;;       as to competency, please address the following:
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",87,0)
 ;;             What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",88,0)
 ;;             to manage his or her financial affairs, including consideration
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",89,0)
 ;;             of such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",90,0)
 ;;             payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",91,0)
 ;;             and handling the payment prudently? Does the veteran handle
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",92,0)
 ;;             the money and pay the bills himself or herself?
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",93,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",94,0)
 ;;             Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is

 ;;             capable of managing his or her financial affairs?
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",96,0)
 ;;             Please provide examples to support your conclusion.

"RTN","DVBCWPD7",106,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPD7",110,0)
 ;;   say so, and explain why. If the opinion asks "... is it at least as likely

 ;;     impairment in functional status and quality of life. 
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",121,0)
 ;;       Particularly in cases where a veteran is unemployed, specific 
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",122,0)
 ;;       details about the effects of PTSD and its symptoms on employment
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",123,0)
 ;;       are especially important.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",124,0)
 ;;   - If possible, describe extent to which disorders other than PTSD
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",125,0)
 ;;     (e.g., substance use disorders) are independently responsible for
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",126,0)
 ;;     impairment in psychosocial adjustment and quality of life. If this is
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",127,0)
 ;;     not possible, explain why (e.g., substance use had onset after PTSD 
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",128,0)
 ;;     and clearly is a means of coping with PTSD symptoms).
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",129,0)
 ;;   - If possible, describe pre-trauma risk factors or characteristics that
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",130,0)
 ;;     may have rendered the veteran vulnerable to developing PTSD subsequent
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",131,0)
 ;;     to trauma exposure.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",132,0)
 ;;   - If possible, state prognosis for improvement of psychiatric condition
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",133,0)
 ;;     and impairments in functional status.
"RTN","DVBCWPD7",134,0)
 ;;   - Comment on whether veteran should be rated as competent for VA purposes

 ;;     in terms of being capable of managing his/her benefit payments in

"RTN","DVBCWPE7",38,0)
 ;;    2. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible

"RTN","DVBCWPE7",40,0)

 ;;NOTE:  VA is prohibited by statute, 38 U.S.C. 1110, from paying compensation
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",44,0)
 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",45,0)
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",46,0)
 ;;or is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected disorder, the  
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",47,0)
 ;;veteran may be entitled to compensation.  See Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",48,0)
 ;;1368, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Therefore, it is important to determine the
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",49,0)
 ;;relationship, if any, between a service-connected disorder and a disability
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",50,0)
 ;;resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.  Unless alcohol or drug
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",51,0)
 ;;abuse is secondary to or is caused or aggravated by another mental disorder,
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",52,0)
 ;;you should separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the alcohol or
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",53,0)
 ;;drug abuse from the effects of the other mental disorder(s).  If it is not
"RTN","DVBCWPE7",54,0)
 ;;possible to separate the effects in such cases, please explain why.
