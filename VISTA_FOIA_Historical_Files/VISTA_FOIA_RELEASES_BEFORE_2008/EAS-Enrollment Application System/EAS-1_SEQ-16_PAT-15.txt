 Functional Overview:
 ====================
 Note: The User's Manual and Technical Manual are being updated to 
 include the functional changes discussed below. Where noted, please refer
 to the appropriate manual for detailed information.  
  
 This patch provides the following enhancements and modifications:
  
 1. The primary enhancement is to the methodology for printing the means 
 test reminder letters.  Several sites have reported problems printing the 
 letters consistently.  Changes to how the letters are tasked and sent to 
 the I/O device should correct this problem.  Specifically, testing with 
 QUEUING, Field #5.5, in the DEVICE File, #3.5, set to each of the 
 following values: ALLOWED, FORCED, and NOT ALLOWED has shown the letters 
 to print with each setting.  The tasking methodology has also been 
 modified which should allow a quicker freeing up of the terminal when 
 printing the letters interactively.
  
 2. With the changes above, the background job [EAS MT LETTERS BG PRINT] 
 will no longer handle "multiple" print locations.  When this option is 
 set up through the Schedule/Unschedule option, a print device must be
 specified.  All letters will then print to that printer.  If you need to
 print letters by location, you will need to use the letter print menu.  
 When selecting a facility to filter letters by, a look-up on the 
 INSTITUTION File, #4, will be used rather than using the subset entered 
 into file #713.  
  
 3. When printing the means test reminder letters, the letter 
 functionality will check if the current means test is owned by the 
 facility.  It checks this by examining the SOURCE OF INCOME TEST, field 
 #.23, in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File, #408.31.  If this field is VAMC, 
 this means test is considered "owned" by the current facility and may be 
 edited.  If this field is IVM or OTHER FACILITY, the means test is not 
 considered "owned" by the current facility and a means test letter will 
 not be printed.  The Means Test returned field in the EAS MT LETTER 
 STATUS File, #713.2, will be automatically updated with a comment of 
 "MT OWNED BY ANOTHER FACILITY" (See User manual for additional details).
 If the source of income test is DCD and the site is a DCD site, the 0-day
 letter will still be printed.
  
 4. The limitation on RESEARCH type appointments in the appointment 
 blocking application has been removed.
  
 5.  An option to print test letters has been added to the EAS MT 
 Parameter Menu [EAS MT SETUP MENU].  This option, Print a Test Letter 
 (EAS MT) [EAS MT TEST LETTER] will print a "test" letter with the 
 following header:
  
  
    [Facility Address]
    [Facility Address]
    [Facility Address]
  
    Jul 03, 2002
  
    TEST LETTER (DO NOT MAIL!) (6789)
    THIS IS A TEST LETTER STREET ADDRESS
    ANYTOWN NY 11111-0000
  
    [Body]
  
  
 6. In order to assist with patient privacy, only the last four digits of
 the veteran's SSN will be added to the letter after the veteran's name in
 the address block. (See above sample)
  
 7. A new report, Means Test Expiration by Appt Date
 [EAS MT APPT EXPIRATION RPT], has been added which provides a list of
 veterans by clinic whose means test anniversary date will be reached on
 their appointment date. This report allows selection by date of
 appointment and will print each clinic where appointments are found for
 means test due patients (see User manual for additional details).

 8. A new parameter has been added which will allow sites to specify 
 whether the primary facility's return address or the return address for 
 the preferred facility will print on the means test reminder letters.  
 This parameter may be set through the EAS MT Parameter Entry/Edit [EAS MT 
 PARAMETERS], "Allow Alternate Return Address?".  This parameter will 
 allow either a "YES" or a "NO".  If set to "YES", when the means test 
 reminder letter is printed, if a valid facility address is available, 
 that address will print as the return address on the letter.  If a valid 
 address is not available, or the parameter is set to "NO", then the 
 facility address for the primary site will print as the return address. 
 See User manual for additional details.
  
 9. Veterans who are Cat C, decline to provide income data, and agree to 
 pay deductible are now correctly handled by the means test blocking API.
     
 10. The Count of Pending Letters report has been reformatted.  When this 
 report is run, you will be prompted for "Print Summary Only? YES//".  If 
 you take the default, a summary of letters currently flagged to print 
 will be displayed:
  
   Count of Letters Pending to Print (Flag to Print marked 'YES')
   Printed: Jul 03, 2002@14:00:48
 =================================================================
              60-Day letters flagged to print:    32
              30-Day letters flagged to print:    4
               0-Day letters flagged to print:    10
  
 If you answer "NO" at the prompt, after the summary is displayed, you 
 will be prompted to display the detailed listing of letters flagged to 
 print:

 The Sched. Date is the date the flagged letter is currently scheduled to 
 print on.  If the date is prior to the current date, the letter may have 
 an incomplete address that is preventing it from printing.  If the date 
 is in the future, then the print date has not yet been reached. 
  
 11. The Veteran MT Return Edit [EAS MT RETURNED] option has been modified 
 to turn off all the pending print flags for the entry when this option is 
 used instead of waiting to reset the flags when the next letter print job 
 is run. 
  
 12. The MEANS TEST LETTERS STATISTIC REPORT has been modified to make the 
 report more usable.  The report now displays as follows:

 Technical Overview:
 ===================
  
 Data Dictionary Changes:
 ------------------------
 ALLOW OTHER RETURN ADDRESS, Field #9, EAS MT PARAMETERS File, #713, is a 
 new field added to the EAS MT Parameters file. This field is a set of 
 codes where a '1' stands for YES and '0' stands for NO.  A NO will force 
 all letters to print the primary facility's return address on the 
 letters.  A YES will allow the printing of the return address listed for 
 the preferred facility as entered in the PATIENT File, #2.  (If a complete
 return address is not available, the return address will default to the
 primary facility's return address.)  This field, ALLOW OTHER RETURN
 ADDRESS, Field #9, is accessible through the EAS MT Parameter Entry/Edit
 [EAS MT PARAMETERS] option.
  
 ALLOW MULTIPLE PRINT DEVICES?, Field #8, EAS MT PARAMETERS File, #713, 
 has been renamed to ALLOW FILTERING BY LOCATION? in line with the 
 revisions to the printing rules.  The help prompt has been updated and 
 the data structure remains unchanged.
  
 New Options:
 ------------
 Means Test Expiration by Appt Date [EAS MT APPT EXPIRATION RPT] - This 
 report provides a list by clinic and appointment date of patients whose 
 means test anniversary date will be reached on the date of their 
 appointment.  Report displays by clinic the name, last four, anniversary 
 date and time of appointment.  This option is available on the Report 
 Menu [EAS MT REPORT MENU]
  
 Print a Test Letter (EAS MT) [EAS MT TEST LETTER] - This option prints a 
 generic test letter from the EAS MT LETTERS File, #713.3.  User will be 
 asked to select the type of letter to print in a test format.  The 
 printed letter includes a "DO NOT MAIL" warning as part of the patient 
 name.  This option is available on the EAS MT Parameter Menu [EAS MT 
 SETUP MENU]  
  
 Changed Options:
 ----------------
 EAS MT Parameter Entry/Edit [EAS MT PARAMETERS] - The parameter screen 
 has been modified to remove the Additional Print Locations in line with 
 the changes above and to add the new Allow Alternate Return Address 
 parameter.  The Allow Filtering by Location has been changed to match the 
 new data dictionary update.
  
  
                   EAS MEANS TEST LETTERS PARAMETER ENTRY/EDIT
