 IVMB*2.0*867 before January 1, 2006.
  
 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2005-064 - This patch MUST be installed before January

 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for income year 2005 provided 
 in VHA DIRECTIVE 2005-064, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST 
 THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2006 are distributed with this patch.  The

 determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year, based 
 on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index.  The geographic based 
 income limits for FY 2005 can be found at:
