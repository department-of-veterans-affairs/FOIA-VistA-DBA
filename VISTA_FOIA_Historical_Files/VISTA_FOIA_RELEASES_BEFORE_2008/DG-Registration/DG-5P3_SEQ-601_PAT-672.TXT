Description:
============

 ********************************** NOTE **********************************
 This set of patches is being released as EMERGENCY due to the 
 potential risk of corrupting data if the installations are not 
 coordinated. This host file, DG_53_P672.KID, includes the following 
 patches:  DG*5.3*672, EAS*1.0*62, IVM*2.0*109 and SD*5.3*451.
 **************************************************************************
  
 The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support 
 technology and business changes that are occurring with the 
 implementation of the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Enrollment System 
 Redesign (ESR) project.  Some modified and new business functionality is 
 being included in the new system, and corresponding changes are necessary 
 in VistA for preliminary determination of the veteran's Enrollment and 
 Eligibility status.  This release represents the first VistA phase of the 
 project, called 'EVC Early Release'.
  
 This patch is being released along with EAS*1.0*62 (Enrollment 
 Application System), IVM*2.0*109 (Income Verification Match), and
 SD*5.3*451 (Scheduling) in host file: DG_53_P672.KID
  
 The EVC Early Release modifications include:
 - Modifications to Eligibility Codes;
 - Modifications to Enrollment Status;
 - Modifications to the rules for Continuous Enrollment;
 - Enhanced data sharing between VistA and HEC. 
  
 Features of this release are as follows:
 =======================================
  
 The modifications implemented in this patch, DG*5.3*672 include:
  
 1.  In the MAS Eligibility Code file (#8.1) and the Eligibility Code 
 file (#8), the TRICARE/CHAMPUS eligibility code has been renamed to 
 TRICARE.  
  
 2.  In the MAS Eligibility Code file (#8.1) and the Eligibility Code 
 file (#8), the MEXICAN BORDER WAR and REIMBURSABLE INSURANCE 
 Eligibility Codes have been inactivated and will no longer be 
 selectable as Eligibility Codes. 
  
 3.  A new report, Reimbursable Insurance Primary EC Report [DG 
 REIMBURSABLE PRIM EC RPT] was added to identify patients who have 
 Reimbursable Insurance as Primary Eligibility Code. Sites must review 
 the report and manually assign a new Eligibility Code for these 
 patients.
  
 4.  In the Enrollment Status file (#27.15), the enrollment status of 
 PENDING; NO ELIGIBILITY CODE IN VIVA has been renamed to PENDING; NO 
 ELIGIBILITY CODE.
  
 5.  In the patient's enrollment record, the Effective Date field (#.08) 
 in the Patient Enrollment file (#27.11) will be set to the date when 
 the record is updated for the following enrollment statuses:
     DECEASED
     NOT ELIGIBLE; INELIGIBLE DATE
     NOT ELIGIBLE; REFUSED TO PAY COPAY.
  
  
 6.  HEC will now transmit enrollment records with a status of PENDING; 
 ELIGIBILITY STATUS IS UNVERIFIED and PENDING; NO ELIGIBILITY CODE to 
 the sites.  
  
 7.  The continuous enrollment algorithm has been modified in HEC Legacy 
 and VistA to coordinate with ESR.  The following rules will be executed 
 (in this order):
 a. If the current enrollment record has an Application Date that is 
 prior (<) to the Enrollment Group Threshold (EGT) Effective Date and 
 the current or any previous enrollment record has an Effective Date of 
 Change that is prior to the EGT Effective date THEN the veteran is 
 continuously enrolled.
 b. If there is no application date and the earliest Effective Date of
 change is prior to the EGT Effective Date THEN the veteran is 
 continuously enrolled.
 c. As the system reviews current and prior enrollment records with any 
 enrollment status on the following list they will be ignored for 
 determination of continuous enrollment:    
      Pending Means Test Required, 
      Pending Purple Heart Unconfirmed 
      Pending Eligibility Status Unverified 
      Pending Other 
      Pending No Eligibility Code
      Deceased
      Not Eligible; Ineligible Date
 d. If the current record has an Enrollment Status of Not Eligible; 
 Refused to Pay Copay AND the veteran Agrees to Pay Deductible Indicator 
 is being changed from No to Yes THEN VistA will allow the preliminary 
 enrollment action.
 e. If a veteran has ever had a verified enrollment record with 
 eligibility in the following list then the veteran will be considered 
 continuously enrolled:
     SC 10% or greater and SC% is changed to SC 0% non compensable
     Aid & Attendance = YES and A&A is now not YES 
     Housebound = YES and Housebound is now not YES
     VA Pension = YES and VA Pension is now not YES
     If AO Location = KOREAN DMZ prior to ESR implementation (The date 
        used will be 12/29/2040 until ESR is implemented.  The date will be
        modified with a future release of EVC.)
     CV End Date in a Verified enrollment expires after Enrollment 
        Application Date
     Veteran is enrolled due to MT status and a subsequent income year 
        means test was added or edited that would place the veteran in a
        priority group not being enrolled then Continuously Enroll.  The
        exception is if the veteran's first verified enrollment record was
        due to MT status and the primary MT of that same income year was
        changed to a status that would not enroll (e.g., due to IVM
        converted test or Hardship removal).
   
 The following exceptions to the above rules are noted:
 - A Manual Override by a HEC User can either Reject or Continuously 
 Enroll a record regardless of the business rules listed above.
 - Once an enrollment record is Rejected, it will stay Rejected as long as 
 the veteran stays in a priority group not being accepted for new 
 enrollments.
 - Once an enrollment record is manually placed in a Verified Enrollment 
 Status via the Override function the veteran will not be placed in a 
 Rejected enrollment status until a new EGT is set which could disqualify 
 the veteran from enrollment or if the record is manually overridden to 
 Rejected.
 - Once a record's enrollment status is cancelled/declined enrollment 
 status it will be treated the same as a rejected enrollment status and 
 not be continuously enrolled as long as a veteran stays in a priority 
 group that is not being accepted for new enrollments.
  
 8.  The Z11 HL7 message receiver was modified to add the following two 
 fields: Military Disability Retirement and Discharge Due to Disability.
  
 9.  A new field, Military Disability Retirement (#.3602), has been added 
 to the Patient file (#2).  It replaces the existing field, Disability 
 Ret. From the Military (#.362).  This new field has been added to the 
 Military Service Data Screen 6 in following options:  Register a Patient 
 [DG REGISTER PATIENT], Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA], and 
 View Registration Data [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
  
 10.  A new field, Discharge Due to Disability (#.3603), has been added to 
 the Patient file (#2).  It replaces the existing field, Disability 
 Discharge on 1010EZ (#1010.158).  This new field has been added to the 
 Military Service Data Screen 6 in following options:  Register a Patient 
 [DG REGISTER PATIENT], Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA], and 
 View Registration Data [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
  
 11.  A one-time post-install process will move data from the existing 
 Patient file field #1010.158 Disability Discharge on 1010EZ to the new 
 field #.3603 Discharge Due to Disability.   See the explanation in the 
 "Pre-install and Post-install changes" section below.
  
 12.  A one-time post-install process will convert data from the existing 
 Patient file field #.362 Disability Ret. From Military to the new fields 
 #.3602 Military Disability Retirement and #.3603 Discharge Due to 
 Disability.  See the explanation in the "Pre-install and Post-install 
 changes" section below.
  
 13.  A clean-up job will run to delete the REIMBURSABLE INSURANCE 
 eligibility code from the Patient Eligibilities sub-file (#2.0361) of the 
 Patient file (#2) for all patients.  See the explanation in the
 "Pre-install and Post-install changes" section below.
  
 14. A new field, Discharge Due to Disability (#50.19), has been added to 
 the Patient Enrollment file (#27.11).  This field will be updated with 
 data from the Discharge Due to Disability field (#.3603) in the Patient 
 file (#2) when an enrollment record is added for that patient.

 Data Dictionary Changes
 =======================
 The following new fields have been added:
  
 1. Military Disability Retirement field (#.3602) in the PATIENT file 
 (#2). The data type is a set of codes, and the values are 1=YES; 0=NO.
 NOTE:  This field will replace the Disability Ret. from the Military 
 field (#.362) which will no longer be updated/used as of DG*5.3*672. 
 Future patch DG*5.3*659 "IRR Method and Help Text Updates" will change 
 the DD field description text to explain that data in field #.362 is no 
 longer updated.
  
 2. Discharge Due to Disability field (#.3603) in the PATIENT file (#2).
 The data type is a set of codes, and the values are 1=YES; 0=NO.
 NOTE:  This field will replace the Disability Discharge on 1010EZ field 
 (#1010.158) which will no longer be updated/used as of DG*5.3*672.

 the DD field description text to explain that data in field #1010.158 
 is no longer updated.
  
 3. Discharge Due to Disability field (#50.19) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT
 file (#27.11).  The data type is a set of codes, and the values are 
 1=YES; 0=NO.
  
 New Option
 ==========
 A new option, Reimbursable Insurance Primary EC Report [DG REIMBURSABLE
 PRIM EC RPT] has been created to produce a report listing patients who 
 have Reimbursable Insurance as the primary Eligibility Code.  These 
 patients will have to be reviewed at the site and new primary
 eligibilities must be manually entered.  The report can be run multiple 
 times.  The new option will be added to the Supervisor ADT Menu [DG
 SUPERVISOR MENU].
  
  
 Pre-install and Post-install changes
 ====================================
 1.  A one-time post-install process will run when the patch is installed 
 to move data as shown below from the existing Patient file field 
 #1010.158 Disability Discharge on 1010EZ to the new field #.3603 
 Discharge Due to Disability. 
  
 1010.158 current          .3603 new
 ----------------          ---------------
      1=YES                    1=YES
      0=NO                     0=NO
  
 The one-time post-install process will convert data as shown below from 
 the existing Patient file field #.362 Disability Ret. from Military to 
 the new fields #.3602 Military Disability Retirement and #.3603 Discharge 
 Due to Disability.  Only data values 1 and 2 in the old field will be 
 converted in this process.  If a value was already moved to field #.3603 
 from field #1010.158 it will not be overwritten.  
  
                                    New Value of         New Value of
 Existing Value of Disability       Military Disability  Discharge Due to
 Ret. from Military (.362)          Retirement (.3602)   Disability (.3603)
 -------------------------------    ------------------   ------------------
 1=YES, RECEIVING MILITARY          1=YES                1=YES
 2=YES, RECEIVING MILITARY          1=YES                1=YES
   IN LIEU OF VA COMPENSATION
  
 The remaining values will be converted by a process that will be run at 
 the HEC after the installation of patch IVMB*2*849.
  
                                                         New Value of 
 Existing Value of Disability   New Value of Military    Discharge
 Retirement from Military       Disability Retirement    Due to Disability
 ---------------------------    ----------------------   -----------------
 0=NO                           0=NO                     0=NO
 3=UNKNOWN                      0=NO                     0=NO
  
  
 2.  Two entries in the 1010EZ MAPPING file (#711) will be updated to map 
 to the new disability fields (see previous item).   This will enable the 
 data from 1010EZ forms to update the new fields in the PATIENT file (#2).
    DISABILITY RETIREMENT FROM MILITARY now maps to field .3602
    DISABILITY DISCHARGE CLAIMED now maps to field .3603.  
  
 3.  The post-install process will run a job to delete the REIMBURSABLE
 INSURANCE eligibility code from the Patient Eligibilities sub-file
 (#2.0361) of the Patient file (#2) for all patients.  This clean-up does
 not affect the Primary Eligibility Code.  If the Primary Eligibility Code
 contains REIMBURSABLE INSURANCE, it will have to be changed manually.  
 (See item 3 in the "Features" section above).
  
 4.  The post-install processes described in items 1 and 3 in this section 
 will run as separate concurrent jobs.  At the conclusion of each job a 
 mail message will be sent with information about each process, such as 
 the start and stop times, the number of patients processed, the number of
 records converted, etc.
