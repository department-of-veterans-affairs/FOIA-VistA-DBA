Subject: MailMan poller error on NT system

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
   This MailMan patch is in KIDS format.  Please make sure you follow the
   Installation instructions.  This patch corrects an error with the TCP/IP
   poller, on the NT machine, that was introduced with Kernel patch 18,
   XU*8.0*18. NOIS: WRJ-0396-10453
  
  ===========================================================================
   This patch can be installed with users on the system. This patch will only
   install 1 routine, XMRTCP. You must move the routine to your NT machine and
   then reboot MSM on the NT machine.  This will restart the TCP/IP poller.
    
  ===========================================================================
  INSTALLATION:
    1.  This routine might be mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the routine.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    3.  Answer NO to the question:
        'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'.
    4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
        'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
        have the correct checksums.
    6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
        'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XM*7.1*25' and proceed
        with install.
    7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'.
    8.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
    9.  MSM Sites, after patch has installed, move the routine XMRTCP to
        your NT machine.  Then reboot MSM on the NT machine, this will
        restart the TCP/IP mail poller.
   ====================================================================
