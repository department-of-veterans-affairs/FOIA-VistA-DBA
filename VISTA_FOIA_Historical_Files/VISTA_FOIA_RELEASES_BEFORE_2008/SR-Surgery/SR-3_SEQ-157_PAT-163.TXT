Description:
============

 This patch makes changes to the Surgery software following the 
 installation of patch DG*5.3*757 (SURGICAL SPECIALTY FILE CHANGES) for 
 the PTF Fields No Longer Needed project:
  
 1. The Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] option 
 is updated to correspond with the codes and specialties that exist in the 
 updated SURGICAL SPECIALTY file (#45.3).
  
 2. The functionality that allows the input of preoperative risk 
 assessment information when entering or updating a surgery request if the 
 ASK FOR RISK PREOP INFO field (#17) in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file 
 (#133) is set to YES is updated so that this functionality works 
 correctly with the updated code for CARDIAC SURGERY in the SURGICAL 
 SPECIALTY file (#45.3).
  
 3. The logic executed when editing the CASE SCHEDULE TYPE field (#.035) 
 in the SURGERY file (#130) is updated so that this logic works correctly 
 with the updated code for CARDIAC SURGERY in the SURGICAL SPECIALTY file 
 (#45.3) to populate the CARDIAC SURGICAL PRIORITY field (#414) in the 
 SURGERY file (#130).
