Associated patches: (v)XU*8*236    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*259'

Subject: Disable XUHUI Protocols

Category: 
  - Other

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   When patch XU*8*236 was built it was intended that the following two(2) 
 Protocols, 'XUHUI FIELD CHANGE EVENT' and 'XUHUI SEND MESSAGE' be sent out
 with the DISABLE field(#2) filled in with the following message:
  "*Do NOT remove this message"
 because sites will need to obtain the middle ware first before 
 activating these Protocols. The only exception to this case is HONOLULU,
 HI the original developers of the middle ware. This patch will first look
 at entry #1 of the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file(#8989.3) and get the
 external value of the pointer to the DOMAIN file(#4.2), if the domain
 contains 'HONOLULU' then no action will be taken. On the other hand, if
 the domain name does not contain 'HONOLULU', then the DISABLE field(#2)
 will be set with the above mentioned message.  Currently the Protocols
 look like:

 Select OPTION: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES  
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PROTOCOL// 
 Select PROTOCOL NAME: XUHUI FIELD CHANGE EVENT       Field Change Event
