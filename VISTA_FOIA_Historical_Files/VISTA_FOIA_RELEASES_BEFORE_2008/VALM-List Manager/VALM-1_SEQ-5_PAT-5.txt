Description: 
============

 Patch VALM*1.0*5
  
 NOIS: BAC-1299-40994, BIG-0100-70871, BUT-0200-20477, CHA-1299-30668,
       CLL-0300-40521, CMO-1299-40623, FAV-0200-71768, HUN-1299-20803,

       WIM-1299-20665
 Test Sites:  Columbia, MO; Butler, PA; Battle Creek, MI; Wilmington, DE
  
 Background: Patch VALM*1.0*3 introduced an error when printing directly (not
 queued) to a device.  Although patch VALM*1.0*3 was subsequently marked
 "entered in error", many sites did not back it out, because it also contained
 some desired new features.  Patch VALM*1.0*3 remains "entered in error".
  
 Patch VALM*1.0*5 replaces patch VALM*1.0*3.  It corrects the errors and
 retains the desired features introduced in patch VALM*1.0*3.
 When printing a list (PL) or printing a screen (PS):
   - Do not eject an extra blank page before starting the print.
   - If the list item width is greater than the device width, print a warning
     message.
  
 NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
 If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
 Outpatient Pharmacy, Appointment Management), they may experience a Clobber
 Error.  This patch requires patch VALM*1.0*1.

 INSTALLATION:
 NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
 If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
 Outpatient Pharmacy, Appointment Management), they may experience a Clobber
 Error.  This patch requires patch VALM*1.0*1. 
 1.  Users should NOT be on the system during installation of this patch.
 2.  DSM Sites: If any of these routines is mapped, disable mapping for the 
     affected routine(s).  
 3.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.  This loads 
     the patch into a Transport Global on your system.
     If it loads, go on to step 4.
     If you get the following error message:
 **INSTALL ABORTED** Patch VALM*1.0*1 is Required to install this package!!
 VALM*1.0*5 Build will not be installed, Transport Global deleted! 
     and you are sure that you have installed VALM*1.0*1, you probably need
     to use FileMan to edit the package entry as follows.  (This problem was
     caused because VALM*1.0*1 was released without a package file link.)
