Description: 
============

 This patch provides a new set of Alert Tools that satisfies the following 
 E3Rs:
 
 #13527   IDENTIFIED SIGNERS NOT GETTING VIEW ALERTS
 #16045   2ND ALERT FOR UNSIGNED OR UNCOSIGNED TIU DOCUMENTS
 #16078   FORWARD UNSIGNED NOTES VA TO SVC CHIEF
 #17785   ABILITY TO GENERATE ALERT TO 3RD PARTY SIGNER
 #17784   UNSIGNED DOC ALERT TO COSIGNER WHEN AUTHOR GONE
 
 Using the List Manager interface, users can search for documents by 
 STATUS (single, multiple or all), and AUTHOR/DICTATOR, EXPECTED COSIGNER, 
 ATTENDING PHYSICIAN, and ADDITONAL SIGNER* (single, multiple, or all), and 
 REFERENCE DATE (single date or date range) for an user entered individual**.
 
 * Additional Signers will only appear if they have NOT signed the document
 ** The user will be notified if the individual entered as part of the 
    search criteria is inactive or DIUSER'd.
 
 All TIU documents will be searched regardless of document class or type; 
 Progress notes, Discharge Summaries, and Interdisciplinary Notes will all 
 be included if they meet the search criteria.  Any document will only be 
 listed once even if it meets multiple search criteria.
 
 Only documents that match each search category will be included; descendant 
 documents whose parent document matches the search criteria will be listed 
 concurrent with their parent document even if other documents fall in between 
 their REFERENCE DATE.  This affects the document display order only; as
 shown below.
 
 Example Display (Date Range 06/21/02-06/30/02):
 
 Cnt  Patient         Document Title                        Ref Date  Status
 
 1    VADER,D         _ Discharge Summary                   06/21/02  UNSIGNED   
 2    VADER,D            _Addendum to Discharge Summary     06/28/02  UNSIGNED   
 3    FETT,B          MEDICINE NOTE                         06/23/02  UNSIGNED
 
 If a parent document does NOT meet the search criteria, the 
 descendant will be listed as shown below (Child documents that are NOT 
 addendums will have their title displayed).  The only difference is the 
 modified date range.
 
 Notice the addendum has been listed AFTER the Medicine Note since it's 
 parent document no longer meets the search criteria.
 
 Example Display 2 (Date Range 06/23/02-06/30/02):
 
 1    FETT,B          MEDICINE NOTE                         06/23/02  UNSIGNED
 2    VADER,D         Addendum to Discharge Summary         06/28/02  UNSIGNED
 
 Once documents have been found and displayed, the user can select a single 
 document (#), multiple documents(#,#,#), range of documents(#-#), or
 combination (#,#,#-#) of documents.
 
 Once a document or documents have been selected, the TIU Alert Tools provide
 the following alert functions:
 
   BROWSE DOCUMENT - If authorized, read only view of selected document.
 
   CHANGE VIEW - Allows user to enter new search criteria.
 
   COMBINATION ALERTS - Allows users to send new alerts for single or
                        multiple documents to the expected signers (AUTHOR/
                        DICTATOR, EXPECTED COSIGNER/ATTENDING PHYSICIAN,
                        and ADDITIONAL SIGNER(S)) and one or more third 
                        parties.  The rules outlined below for RESEND ALERTS
                        apply for a document's expected signers.
 
   DELETE ALERTS - Allows users to delete all of the alerts for a single or 
                   multiple documents.
 
   DETAILED DISPLAY - If authorized, allows the user to view document 
                      details.
 
   EDIT DOCUMENT - If authorized, allows the user to edit a selected TIU
                   document.
 
   IDENTIFY SIGNERS - If authorized, allows the user to edit the expected
                      signers of a TIU document and add/remove additional
                      signers.
 
   RESEND ALERTS - Allows users to regenerate alerts for a single document
                   or multiple documents; all alerts associated with each 
                   document are deleted before being resent - previously 
                   sent 3rd Party Alerts would be deleted and would need to
                   be resent.  Alerts are sent appropriate to the document's 
                   status and only to expected signers as follows:
 
                   Author/Dictator &
                   Expected Co-signer/Attending - will only receive alerts
                                                  if they have not signed.
 
                   Additional Signer(s) - will only receive alerts if the
                                          document has been signed.
 
   THIRD PARTY ALERTS* - Allows users to send new alerts for a single 
                         document or multiple documents to one or more third
                         parties regardless of the document's status.
 
 *All manually generated alerts can be tracked using the ALERT TRACKING 
 (#8992.1) file with the field GENERATED BY (#.05)
 
 After installation, the new option entitled TIU Alert Tools [TIU ALERT 
 TOOLS] will be located on the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU]
 as shown:

 Frequently Asked Questions:
 ==========================
   1.  My search results by an ADDITIONAL SIGNER and UNSIGNED documents
       aren't showing any matches but I know they exist. What's wrong?
 
       Additional signers are usually added AFTER a document has been signed
       or co-signed.  Add UNCOSIGNED and COMPLETED documents to your search
       criteria.
 
   2.  I want to regenerate alerts for an UNCOSIGNED document, but I don't
       want the AUTHOR to get alerted.  Should I just send a 3rd Party Alert
       to the EXPECTED COSIGNER?
 
       You could, but if you select RESEND ALERTS, the regenerated alerts
       are context sensitive and sent only to individuals that have NOT 
       signed the document; in this case, only the EXPECTED COSIGNER and 
       any ADDITIONAL SIGNERS that have not signed will be alerted.
 
   3.  I selected RESEND ALERTS and my 3rd Party Alerts disappeared! What
       happened?
 
       A document's alerts are deleted before being regenerated so that they
       remain accurate regarding the document's status; 3rd Party Alerts are
       deleted as well and must be resent since they are not officially part
       of the document's record and cannot be automatically regenerated.
 
   4.  I changed the ADDITIONAL SIGNER for a document using IDENTIFY 
       SIGNERS, but it didn't update in the display.  Why not?
 
       Because there can be more than one ADDITIONAL SIGNER, unless the 
       ADDITIONAL SIGNER matches the search criteria, it won't be displayed.
 
   5.  I added an ADDITIONAL SIGNER for a document using IDENTIFY SIGNERS,
       but it didn't update in the display.  Why not?
 
       See # 4.
 
   6.  The AUTHOR of several documents (requiring co-signature) is gone
       and I want to regenerate the alerts for the EXPECTED COSIGNER so
       they can SIGN and COSIGN these UNSIGNED documents.  
       Should I use RESEND?
       
       It depends.  Default alert behavior would be to send the alert AFTER 
       the author has signed and in this case, the EXPECTED COSIGNER would 
       have never received the alerts initially or even after using RESEND.
 
       However, with TIU*1*151, a new document parameter was added
       that could be set so that the EXPECTED COSIGNER could receive the
       alert IMMEDIATELY; even if the AUTHOR has not signed.
       This parameter is shown below:
 
       ------
       SEND COSIGNATURE ALERT: After Author has SIGNED// ?
           Specify when the alert for cosignature should be sent
           Choose from: 
             0        After Author has SIGNED
             1        Immediately
       ------
 
       If you have NOT specifically set this parameter or have it set to
       "After Author has SIGNED", you'll need to use a 3rd Party 
       Alert to the EXPECTED COSIGNER or change the parameter's setting 
       to "Immediately" before using RESEND.
 
       If you HAVE set this parameter to "Immediately", you can use RESEND.
 
   7.  I used RESEND ALERT and the EXPECTED COSIGNER didn't get alerted! 
       Why?
 
       Two possible reasons. The first, please see #6.
 
       The second, the EXPECTED COSIGNER may be inactivated or DIUSER'd.
       Currently, kernel does not alert these individuals who are inactive
       or terminated.
 
       TIU*1.0*158 will inform the user that an individual entered as a 
       3rd Party Alert recipient is inactive/DIUSER'd.  However, it does
       not verify every individual attached to a document since this would
       be too system intensive and time consuming on a batch send of alerts.
 
   8.  I used RESEND ALERT and no alerts were resent to anyone, even though 
       it appeared that alerts were being re-generated.  Why?
 
       While TIU may create and attempt to regenerate the alerts (this will 
       always happen if TIU Alerts attempts to fulfill a user's request), it 
       has no way of actually confirming whether or not kernel will send an 
       alert to an individual associated with a document (See #7).
 
       The important rule to remember is that kernel will not actually send
       alerts to inactivated or terminated users.
 
       Additionally, TIU sends alerts based on the current status of the 
       document and whether or not the recipient still needs to sign the 
       document.  If an individual has already signed, they should not 
       receive an alert.  However, if a user associated with a document has
       already signed and they are sent a 3RD PARTY ALERT, they will receive
       another alert.
 
   9.  I sent the AUTHOR (who has already signed) a 3RD PARTY ALERT and now 
       they can't process it!  What should I do?
 
       Just RESEND ALERTs for that document.  All alerts will be deleted and 
       regenerated; 3RD PARTY ALERTS that had been manually generated will
       have to be re-entered (See #3).
