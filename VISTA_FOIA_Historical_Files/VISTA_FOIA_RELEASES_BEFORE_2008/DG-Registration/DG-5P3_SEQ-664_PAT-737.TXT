 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1) HD 151633  String dates in file #45
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Certain dates in the clinical reminders ^PXRMINDX index
 contain trailing zeros.  These are the surgery or procedure
 dates going back some years and stored in the 45.01 or  
 45.05 sub-file of the Patient Treatment File (#45). The source
 of this problem is unknown but it is not a continuing issue. 
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DG737PST will find these entries and correct the 
 dates thru Fileman.  This in turn will correct the ^PXRMINDX
 index entries.  See Post-Install Instructions on how to 
 accomplish this.
  
 2) HD 169522  DG*5.3*689  OEF/OIF
  
 Problem:
 ========
 In the DG Load/Edit Patient Data option, Screen #6, if the patient
 has been subjected to Agent Orange contamination, but the 
 AGENT ORANGE REGISTRATION # (field #.3211) is blank, the 
 "Incomplete" message is displayed.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DGRP6EF has been modified not to check on the registration
 number because it has no impact on whether the status is complete or not.
  
 3) HD 170960  Auditing Turned Off for ICN field (991.01)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Patch DG*5.3*650 inadvertently turned off audit for ICN field (#991.01).
  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Pre-init routine DG737PRE will turn it back on.

    routine, may not be properly evaluated.
  
    CHECK^DG737PST will display the following prompts:
  
    Queue the Clinical Reminders Index date check and update.
   
    Enter the date and time you want the job to start.
