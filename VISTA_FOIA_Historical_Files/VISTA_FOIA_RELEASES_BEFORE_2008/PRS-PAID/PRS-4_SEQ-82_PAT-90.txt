Subject: SR 04-715 SATURDAY PREMIUM PAY FOR TITLE 5 HEALTH CARE OCCUPATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 On December 6, 2003, the President signed into law S. 1156 becoming P.L.
 108-170.  Section 303 of the bill modifies 38 USC 7454(b) to provide 
 Saturday premium pay for certain "health care professionals".  These 
 employees must now receive Saturday premium pay under title 38 rules.  
 This amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect with respect to 
 the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004.
  
 Patch PRS*4.0*90 will update the VistA PAID/ETA software to credit these 
 employees with Saturday premium pay for tours worked on any portion 
 of a Saturday.
  
 This patch will be released prior to the beginning of the payroll 
 processing for pay period 04-01.
  
 The rules for Saturday premium pay are outlined in the MP-6
 Part V Supp. 2.2 and are listed below: 
  
 105.04 SATURDAY PREMIUM PAY
 a. General. Certain full-time and part-time employees whose tour of duty 
 includes Saturday are entitled to premium pay for work performed on tours 
 beginning at midnight Friday and ending at midnight Saturday.
 b. Instructions Applicable to Specific Categories of Employees.
 (1) Nurses. Saturday premium pay equals 25 percent of the basic pay 
 received for each hour in a pay status on a Saturday tour of duty. If an 
 employee has two separate tours, such as a tour that begins on Friday and 
 ends on Saturday and another tour that falls entirely on Saturday, he/she 
 is entitled to premium pay not to exceed 8 hours for each tour of duty.  
 Saturday premium pay hours will be recorded on the VA Form 4-5631 under 
 the Sunday heading in column "3"', thus, coding will be recorded in the 
 coding field labeled "Sunday 3" for the applicable week of the pay 
 period. NOTE: In those instances where an employee has a tour of duty 
 that begins on Saturday and ends on Sunday, the employee's premium 
 entitlement will be recorded as Sunday premium pay. This will enable the 
 PAID System to accurately compute the extra cost incurred as a result of 
 Saturday & premium pay.
 (2) All Other Employees. Excepted as provided in subparagraph (1) above, 
 all other employees are ineligible to receive Saturday premium pay.
  
 The software uses the employee's DUTY BASIS (#9), FLSA (#11), PAY PLAN 
 (#20) and PREMIUM PAY IND (#548) fields, to determine the employee's 
 entitlement string.  These fields are stored in the PAID EMPLOYEE 
 (#450) file. The ENTITLEMENT STRING (#20) field is stored in the PAY
 ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file and is used by the software to determine the 
 types of time the employee can work, or receive credit.
  
 This patch will establish the following 4 Premium Pay Indicators:
  
 S - Saturday Premium Pay
 T - Saturday Premium and On-call pay
 U - Saturday Premium Pay and Standby pay
 V - Saturday Premium Pay and Best of On-call or Standby pay
  
 Central Paid will send out an Edit & Update download with these 
 new Premium Pay Indicators prior to processing of PP 04-01.
