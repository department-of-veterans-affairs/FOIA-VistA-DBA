Subject: Lost Print When Using ';Wn'

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   If a field is printed with the "Wnn" suffix, followed by another field 
 whose data resides on the same node as the field that used the "Wnn" 
 suffix, then the data would not print for the field that was following.
   For example:
  
 Part of the DD:
  .111      STREET ADDRESS 1 (F), [.11;1]
  .112      STREET ADDRESS 2 (F), [.11;2]
  
 The data without the suffix:
 NEW PERSON LIST                          DEC 26,2002  12:27    PAGE 1
 STREET ADDRESS 1
   STREET ADDRESS 2
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1234 MY STREET ADDRESS
   APARTMENT NUMBER 42
  
 Before the patch with using the suffix:
  
 FIRST PRINT FIELD: STREET ADDRESS 1;W15  
 THEN PRINT FIELD: STREET ADDRESS 2  
 THEN PRINT FIELD: 
 Heading (S/C): NEW PERSON LIST// 
 STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: 
 DEVICE:   SYSTEM    Right Margin: 80// 
 NEW PERSON LIST                           DEC 26,2002  12:37    PAGE 1
 STREET ADDRESS
 1                STREET ADDRESS 2
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1234 MY STREET   
 ADDRESS 
  
 After the patch using the suffix:
  
 FIRST PRINT FIELD: STREET ADDRESS 1;W15  
 THEN PRINT FIELD: STREET ADDRESS 2  
 THEN PRINT FIELD: 
 Heading (S/C): NEW PERSON LIST// 
 STORE PRINT LOGIC IN TEMPLATE: 
 DEVICE:   SYSTEM    Right Margin: 80// 
 NEW PERSON LIST                           DEC 26,2002  12:41    PAGE 1
