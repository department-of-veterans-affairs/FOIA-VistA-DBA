Description:
============

 The purpose of this project is to modify the census report to include care
 provided at non-VA facilities.  The census report is used by the Austin
 Automation Center (AAC) to calculate Veterans Equitable Resource
 Allocation (VERA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans
 Integrated Service Network (VISN) level resource allocation methodology.  
 Including non-VA care in the census report will provide a more complete
 census report, better account for bed days of care, and provide more
 accurate diagnosis information than is currently available.  Gail Graham,
 Health Data and Informatics, Program Director has endorsed this request.
  
 The scope of this project is to make the changes necessary to transmit the
 current census information as well as the non-VA Census information 
 requested to the AAC. The non-VA PTF records are currently blocked from
 inclusion in the census reporting process. All patients with an open
 record on the designated date are included in the census report.  Non-VA
 patients do have a record in PTF, but are not part of the census report.  
  
 1)  This patch, DG*5.3*643, will allow for non-VA hospital and community
     nursing home data to be included in the census report that is
     transmitted to AAC. The non-VA hospital and community nursing home
     data will be included in the census, but state home facility and 1-day
     stay dialysis patient data will continue to be excluded.  The census
     report will continue to be produced quarterly for VERA calculations.
  
 2)  The following option is being added via this patch.  An example of 
     use is below.

 To ease the increased workload that will be required to add NON-VA 
 patients to the quarterly census, sites should set up a monitor that 
 reviews open NON-VA PTF records to assure that the only the NON-VA PTF 
 records open are those for patients who are active at the time of the 
 review.  Sites should run the Regenerate Census Workfile [DGPT CENSUS 
 REGEN WORKFILE] option after installing patch, DG*5.3*643. Then, the new
 Fee Basis Census Status Report [DGPT FEE BASIS CENSUS STAT RPT] option can
 be used to clean up the census prior to the next scheduled census.  This
 clean up may require duplicate Non-VA PTF records to be deleted or open
 valid Non-VA PTF records to be closed.
