Description: 
============

  Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
  release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
  installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
  Implementation Manager for CIRN.
  
  
  *****NOTE: This patch must be at ALL sites that are involved with 
  the patient having a request made to change the CMOR.  If it is not
  at all sites, the CMOR may not be updated appropriately. **********
  
  Issue 1:  During the processing of a CMOR Change Request it is possible
  for the message to change the CMOR to not get sent to all the sites and
  the MPI.  The message letting the requesting site know that the
  request had been approved or not approved was also not sent to the
  requesting site. Exception messages were also not being generated when
  error conditions occurred.  This has been corrected. These issues were
  reported in NOISes:  MIA-0300-31962, MAC-0200-62163 and GRJ-0100-50923.
  
  Two new Protocols:  MPIF CMOR APP/DIS and MPIF CMOR APPROVE/DISAPPROVE
  New HL7 Applicatation:  MPIF CMOR CHNG
  
  Updated input template [MPIF RESULT INCOMING] to include corrected
  variable name for the date.
  
  Updated input template [MPIF REQUEST EDIT] to populate the Site field
  with the correct value.  It was possible for the station number to be
  passed instead of the IEN.
  
  Issue 2:  The mail message generated to inform a site that they have
  new CMOR Change Request(s) to process had just the request number as 
  the subject.  Several sites have requested this be enhanced.  The
  subject will now be "CMOR Change Request #" and the request number.
  
  TEST SITES:
