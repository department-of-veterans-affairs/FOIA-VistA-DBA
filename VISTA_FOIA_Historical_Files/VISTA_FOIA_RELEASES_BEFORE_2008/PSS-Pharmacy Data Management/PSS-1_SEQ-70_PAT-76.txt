  Users may be on the system when this patch is installed. Installation takes
  less than one minute.  This patch may be installed during normal
  business hours.
  
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should

  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*76).

       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
