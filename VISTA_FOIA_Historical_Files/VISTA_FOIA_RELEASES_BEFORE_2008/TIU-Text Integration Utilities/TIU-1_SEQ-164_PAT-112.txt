 GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
 ====================
 This patch implements an interface with the Surgery Package v3.0. Nurse
 Intraoperative, Anesthesia, and Operation Reports will be captured,
 electronically signed, and stored in TIU, and will be available on the new
 Surgery Tab in CPRS. Sites using the Non-OR Procedure module of the
 Surgery Package will also be able to capture, sign, and retain Procedure
 Reports for such cases. 
  
 The Reminders Exchange utility is used to export and install a new 
 Surgical Reports Class as an immediate descendent of the Clinical
 Documents class, with the following hierarchical structure:
  
 1      CLINICAL DOCUMENTS                  CL  
 2       +ADDENDUM                          DC  
 3       +DISCHARGE SUMMARY                 CL  
 4       +PROGRESS NOTES                    CL  
 5        SURGICAL REPORTS                  CL  
 6          OPERATION REPORTS               DC  
 7            OPERATION REPORT              TL  
 8          NURSE INTRAOPERATIVE REPORTS    DC  
 9            NURSE INTRAOPERATIVE REPORT   TL  
 10         ANESTHESIA REPORTS              DC  
 11           ANESTHESIA REPORT             TL  
 12         PROCEDURE REPORT (NON-O.R.)     DC  
 13           PROCEDURE REPORT              TL  
  
 These new entries in the Document Definition file will be activated upon
 Installation, but won't come into use until implementation of SR*3*100 is
 complete.
 
 An environment check will be performed to ensure that the new entries will 
 not conflict with any pre-existing DOCUMENT CLASS or TITLE.
  
 At the time of release of SR*3*100 and TIU*1*112, some functional issues 
 related to retracting and reassigning documents remained. There was also 
 an intermittent problem with addenda not being attached to the parent 
 operative report document.  All of these issues will be addressed in 
 follow-up patches to TIU and Surgery software. The patch numbers are 
 TIU*1*187 and SR*3*128.
  
 TIU*1.0*187 is currently in the testing phase and is expected to be 
 released shortly.
  
 Here are the remaining issues related that will be addressed by 
 TIU*1.0*187.
  
 LIT-0204-70862 Unattached Addendum
 Addendums created with an unknown document associated when they should be 
 attached to an Operation Report
  
 Work Around: There is no available workaround. The problem will be
 corrected with the release of TIU*1.0*187.
  
  
 LIT-0304-70956 Concurrent Case Issue
 Reassigning Documents functions differently from other TIU documents. 
 Operation Reports were hard-coded to prevent reassignment if text was 
 already entered for the document attached to the Surgery case.
  
 Work Around: There is no available workaround. The problem will be
 corrected with the release of TIU*1.0*187.
  
  
 SBY-0303-30729 Reassign problems for Operation Reports
 Reassigning Documents functions differently from other TIU documents. 
 Operation Reports were hard-coded to prevent reassignment if text was 
 already entered for the document attached to the Surgery case.
  
 Work around: There is no available workaround. The problem will be
 corrected with the release of TIU*1.0*187.

 The REQUESTING PACKAGE REFERENCE field is extended to allow a reference 
 to a SURGICAL CASE in file #130 to be kept for one or more TIU Documents
 belonging to the SURGICAL REPORTS Class.

                               fld: 6.51
 The input transforms for fields .01, .02, and .03 are revised to 
 eliminate use of the local variable DA, which is not used by VA FileMan's
 Database Server calls (i.e., UPDATE^DIE and FILE^DIE). In addition, two
 new MUMPS-type fields are added to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file to
 support optional functions that the developer of a Class may wish to be
 executed On Browse (e.g., inclusion of supplementary information from the
 requesting package), or On Retract (e.g., communication with the
 requesting package when a document belonging to their Class is retracted). 
  
 INPUT TEMPLATE:
 ===============
 TIU ENTER/EDIT SURGICAL REPORT    FILE #8925 
   This is the EDIT TEMPLATE used by the new SURGICAL REPORTS Class, when 
   a user elects to edit any of the new Surgery titles using the List
   Manager Interface.
  
  
 OPTIONS:
 ========
 TIU REVIEW UNDICTATED DOCS
   This new option presents the clinician with a list of all his/her 
   UNDICTATED documents, which may then be dictated, transcribed, and
   uploaded into TIU. For the time being, only Operation and/or Procedure
   Reports generated from Surgical Cases will be included in this list.
   When the Clinical Procedures application is implemented, undictated CP
   Reports will appear in the list as well. This new option will be added
   to the Integrated Document Management [TIU MAIN MENU MIXED CLINICIAN]
   menu in TIU. You may also wish to add it to your Surgery Menu if your
   Surgeons are more likely to access it from there.
  
 TIU BROWSE DOC TRANSCRIPTION
   This new option allows the transcriptionist to select one or more 
   documents from specific patient's record, and browse each document
   in succession. It allows the transcriber to search, edit, make addenda,
   or print each document, as specified by local business rules.
  
 TIU REVIEW UNTRANSCRIBED DOCS
   This new option allows transcriptionists to generate a list of documents
   that satisfy a variety of search criteria (UNDICTATED and UNTRANSCRIBED 
   documents by default) and search, browse, edit, make addenda, or print 
   selected documents from the list, as permitted by local business rules.
  
  
 LIST TEMPLATES:
 ===============
 TIU BROWSE FOR TRANSCRIPTION
   This List Template will allow transcriptionists to browse documents,

        2        UPLOAD ONLY
        3        DIRECT ENTRY ONLY
 REQUIRE MAS VERIFICATION: N  NO
 REQUIRE AUTHOR TO SIGN: ??
    Currently applies only to Discharge Summaries. This field indicates
    whether or not the author should sign the document before the expected
    cosigner (attending).
          
    If parameter is set to NO, only the expected cosigner is alerted for
    signature. Although the unsigned document appears in the author's unsigned
    list, and he is ALLOWED to sign it, his signature is not REQUIRED.
          
    If set to YES, then the author is alerted for signature, and if the
    expected cosigner should attempt to sign the document first, he is
    informed that the author has not yet signed.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 REQUIRE AUTHOR TO SIGN: Y  YES
 ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S): ??
    A document of the given type, and of ROUTINE urgency, is automatically
    printed whenever one of these events occurs.
          
    For example, a site may specify that ROUTINE documents print only upon
    Completion (i.e., signature or cosignature), while STAT documents print
    upon Release from Transcription, MAS Verification, or both, in addition 
    to printing upon completion.
          
    If print events are not specified, and a CHART COPY DEVICE is defined for
    the Medical Center Division, then the document will be auto-printed only
    upon completion.
          
    If field MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY is set to YES, then auto-print is
    ignored entirely.
          
    If urgency is not specified for some document, then its urgency is
    considered to be routine, and the document prints when a routine print
    event occurs.
    
      Choose from: 
        R        release
        V        verification
        B        both
 ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S): 
 STAT PRINT EVENT(S): ??
    This field is identical to ROUTINE PRINT EVENT(S), except that it applies
    to documents of STAT urgency rather than ROUTINE urgency.
    
      Choose from: 
        R        release
        V        verification
        B        both
 STAT PRINT EVENT(S): 
 MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY: Y  YES
 ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS: ^MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY  
 MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY: YES// ??
    This parameter is used for documents where a manually-printed hard copy
    is desired following document entry. If the parameter is set to YES, the
    user is prompted to print a copy on exit from their preferred editor, and
    auto-printing (as described in fields ROUTINE/STAT PRINT EVENT(S)) is
    ignored.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 MANUAL PRINT AFTER ENTRY: YES// Y  YES
 ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS: ??
    This field determines whether non-MAS users (for example, providers) are
    asked if they want WORK copies or CHART copies when they print a document.
    If the field is NOT set to YES, they are not asked, and the printout is a
    WORK copy.
          
    Generally, this is set to YES for PROGRESS NOTES, which are likely to be
    printed on the Ward or in the Clinic for immediate inclusion in the chart.
    For DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, which are typically printed centrally, it is
    usually set to NO, since duplicate CHART COPIES are a particular problem.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS: Y  YES
 ALLOW >1 RECORDS PER VISIT: ??
    This field determines whether a given document may be created more than
    once per visit.  For example, it is often appropriate to enter multiple
    PROGRESS NOTES for a single HOSPITALIZATION or CLINIC VISIT, whereas only
    one DISCHARGE SUMMARY is usually entered per HOSPITALIZATION.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 ALLOW >1 RECORDS PER VISIT: Y  YES
 ENABLE IRT INTERFACE: ??
    This enables TIU's interface with Incomplete Record Tracking (IRT),
    which updates IRT's deficiencies when transcription, signature,
    or cosignature events are registered for a given document.
          
    NOTE: IRT is designed for DISCHARGE SUMMARIES, and is appropriate only for
    types of documents where only one document is expected per patient
    movement. We therefore ask you to leave this parameter undefined (or set
    it to NO) for PROGRESS NOTES.
    
      Choose from: 
        0        NO
        1        YES
 ENABLE IRT INTERFACE: N  NO
 SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY: ??
    This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care. Together
    with parameter ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS, it determines whether or not
    a user is prompted for diagnoses and procedures after signing or editing a
    document.
          
    If this parameter is set to YES (for suppress), the user is not prompted
    for this information. 
          
    If this parameter is set to NO or is blank, the user may or may not be
    prompted, depending on the type of visit and on parameter ASK DX/CPT ON
    ALL OPT VISITS.
          
    If a site elects to suppress diagnoses and procedures, the site must
    capture this information by some other means (such as an AICS encounter
    form), in order to receive workload credit for these visits.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY: 
 FORCE RESPONSE TO EXPOSURES: ??
    When set to YES, this parameter forces the user to respond when asked to
    specify a veteran's Service Connection Classification (AO, IR, or EC),
    when creating a standalone visit.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 FORCE RESPONSE TO EXPOSURES: 
 ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS: ??
    This parameter applies only to documents for outpatient care, and is
    IGNORED if SUPPRESS DX/CPT ON ENTRY is set to YES.
          
    If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS is
    set to YES, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for scheduled as
    well as unscheduled (stand-alone) visits.
          
    If DX/CPT prompts are NOT suppressed, and ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS is
    set to NO, the user is prompted for DX/CPT information for unscheduled
    visits ONLY.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS: 
 SEND ALERTS ON ADDENDA: ??
    This parameter determines whether AUTHORS and COSIGNERS of a document of
    this kind (and any of its descendent types) will receive an informational
    alert when addenda are added by other persons. Like all document
    parameters, it may be overridden at descendent levels of the Document
    Definition Hierarchy. DEFAULT is NO.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 SEND ALERTS ON ADDENDA: N  NO
 ORDER ID ENTRIES BY TITLE: ??
    This prompt applies only to notes with interdisciplinary entries under
    them.
          
    When an ID note is displayed or printed, the child entries are normally
    ordered by reference date under the parent entry. In some cases it may be
    preferable to order them alphabetically by title. If this parameter is set
    to YES, child entries are displayed by title rather than by date.
          
    The default order is by date.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 ORDER ID ENTRIES BY TITLE: 
 SEND ALERTS ON NEW ID ENTRY: ??
    This parameter applies only to interdisciplinary parent notes.
         
    If this parameter is set to YES, the signer (cosigner) of an
    interdisciplinary parent note is alerted when a new entry is added to the
    note.
          
        The default is NO.
    
      Choose from: 
        1        YES
        0        NO
 SEND ALERTS ON NEW ID ENTRY: 
 SEND COSIGNATURE ALERT: ??
    This parameter controls the sequence in which alerts are sent to the
    expected cosigner of a document. Allowable choices are:
    
      Choose from: 
        0        After Author has SIGNED
        1        Immediately (Concurrent w/Author)
 SEND COSIGNATURE ALERT: I  Immediately (Concurrent w/Author)
 EDITOR SET-UP CODE: ??
    This is M code which is executed prior to invoking the user's preferred
    editor.  It ordinarily sets local variables, which are then used in the
    editor's header, etc.
          
    For example, code written at Boston VAMC sets a local array containing
    patient demographics.  An M-based editor used at the site can then display
    demographic information in a fixed header when a user edits a document.
    
 EDITOR SET-UP CODE: 
  
 If document is to be uploaded, specify Filing Alert Recipients:
  
 Select FILING ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS: <LASTNAME,FIRST>
   Are you adding '<LASTNAME,FIRST>' as 
    a new FILING ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS (the 1ST for this TIU DOCUMENT
    PARAMETERS)? No// Y  (Yes)
 Select FILING ERROR ALERT RECIPIENTS: <Enter>
