 Use of GEC reminder dialogs by staff should be thoroughly tested prior to 
 implementation to avoid GEC report roll-up inaccuracies.  Testing of GEC
 reminder dialogs and reports in a test account should mimic the actual
 processes and workload capture used in the site's production environment.   
 Informatics staff and GEC referral staff should work together to identify 
 potential issues that arise during testing that may require modification
 of clinical processes and/or workload capture.  Accurate capture and reporting
 of GEC referral health factors may require careful analysis of workload
 capture processes at sites that use Event Capture software.  Inaccurate
 reporting may lead to questions from the Inspector General's office 
 concerning funding for the patients referred to the "Home Help" type of 
 programs. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 In December 2003 a Healthcare Inspection by the Department of Veteran 
 Affairs Office of Inspector General was conducted on the Homemaker/Home 
 Health Aide Program to evaluate Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical 
 facilities' compliance with the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) policy 
 for providing services to patients that were clinically appropriate, cost 
 effective, and met customer expectations.  The outcome of that inspection 
 revealed a lack of supportable data for placement of patients.  As part of 
 the Undersecretary for Health's commitment to complying with VA policy, the 
 need for accurately documenting and reporting patient placements is needed. 
 VA Geriatric Extended Care (VA GEC) Reports will serve as an interim 
 reporting method until the national rollup of VA GEC Referral data is 
 provided through Computerized Patient Record System Reengineered (CPRS-R).  
 VA GEC Reports will display the percent of patients referred to select GEC 
 programs who meet the eligibility criteria as outlined in the Under 
 Secretary for Health's Information Letter IL 10-2003-005 and VHA Handbook 
 1140.2.  VA GEC Reports will provide quarterly statistical reports on the 
 following VA funded programs.  
 
 Homemaker/Home Health Aide, when Funding Source=VA
 Adult Day Health Care, when Funding Source=VA
 VA In-Home Respite, when Funding Source=VA
 Care Coordination, when Funding Source=VA
 
 
 Select data from the VA Geriatric Extended Care Referral screening tool, to 
 be released with Clinical Reminders 2.0 patch 2, will be used in 
 calculating the criteria totals for patients screened and referred for
 each of the four programs listed above.

  OPTIONS:
  ========
  GEC Fiscal Quarterly Rollup  [PXRM GEC2 QUARTERLY ROLLUP]
 
  This is a queuable option that will gather and send a report to
  Washington DC, the fiscal quarterly information described in the description
  section of this patch. This option should never be placed on an
  individual's menu. It should be scheduled for the 8th day of the
  first month of each quarter at any time of the facility's
  choosing.(e.g. April 8th at 2am)
  The rescheduling frequency should be set to "3M" (every three months).
 
  MAIL GROUP:
  ==========
  GEC2 NATIONAL ROLLUP
  When this mail group is installed it will contain the email address of the
  two or three individuals in Washington DC who will receive the
  quarterly data.  These names should not be removed. Names of local
  individuals may be added if they desire to receive these reports.
  The reports will also be sent to the Clinical Reminders mail group
  that was set up for receiving reminder errors.
 
  Documentation:
  ==============
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
  patch is available in a new appendix for the Clinical Reminders Clinician 
  Guide.  This documentation will be in the form of an Adobe Acrobat 
  file: PXRM_2_2_UM_APPD.PDF. This file can be retrieved in BINARY
  format by FTP. The preferred method is to FTP the file from
  download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the file from the first
  available FTP server.
 
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
  server as follows:

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PXRM*2.0*2):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch.
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PXRM*2.0*2.
 
   6.  When prompted 'Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'GEC2 NATIONAL 
       ROLLUP': respond with a local name.

       for this patch.
 
   8   When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//
       respond 'NO'
   
   9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
   10. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
 
   11. Schedule option 'PXRM GEC2 QUARTERLY ROLLUP' to start on the 8th day
       of the 1st month of the next quarter after the installation
       of this patch. Set the rescheduling frequency to '3M'.
 
   12. Add local names to the mail group 'GEC2 NATIONAL ROLLUP'.
 
   13. During the installation, four "TASKED" job numbers were displayed. If
       this is a re-installation of the patch, the tasked jobs will not
       be tasked a second time and so the numbers will not be displayed.
