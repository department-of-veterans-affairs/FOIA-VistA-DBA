 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1.  HD165545  Remove item from order error: CAN+5^RMPR4M
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Removing line item from order (after Midnight Processing task has
 been run) causes system error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR4M and RMPR4E21 to correct variable used to 
 delete visit associated with P.O. item.
  
  
 2.  HD170712  Two entries in the V PROVIDER file (#9000010.06)
               per Prosthetics PCE
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The nightly Prosthetics to PCE task is sending a 2nd Provider to the visit
 associated with the issue due to a fault in patch RMPR*3.0*78.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Check the 'BA1' nodes for null piece one instead of entire node being null
 in RMPRPCEA.
  
  
 3.  HD92858    Question on data field CREATED BY USER (#.23) in the VISIT
                File (#9000010)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Prosthetics Midnight PCE task is using the users DUZ that activated
 the task in Taskman instead of Postmaster when creating Visit record and
 populating Created By field.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRPCEB to set the task originator to Postmaster when
 task begins and later used when sent in visit creation.
  
  
 4.  HD62911    Error <SUBSCRIPT>DESP+19^RMPRN6PL
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Subscript error in routine RMPRN6 when handling shipping nodes with
 a 0.00 cost.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRN6 to handle zero cost shipping records properly
 to default to stock description rather accessing the HCPCS file for a 
 description when there is no internal ien for the HCPCS lookup.
  
  
 5.  HD174421   Security Statement - Prosthetics Purchase Order
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Printed P.O.'s do not contain the privacy statement defined in the 
 Data Transfer Agreement in place.  The following statement will be 
 added to printed P.O.'s: 
 "Acceptance of this purchase order requires recipient to take 
 appropriate measures to secure the information and to ensure that 
 the confidentiality of patient information is maintained."
 
 Options that will be affected by the new security message are:
 PCR    Reprint a Purchase Card Form 
 24     Reprint a 2421 Form
 Selecting VISTA print during GUI Purchase Card Order.
 Create a Purchase Card Order via GUI and select GUI print
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRP21, RMPR4P21 and RMPR9P21 to include the
 Data Transfer Agreement after the P.O. header.
