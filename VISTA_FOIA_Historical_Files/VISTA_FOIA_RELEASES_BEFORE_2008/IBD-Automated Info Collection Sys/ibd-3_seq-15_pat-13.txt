Subject: SCREEN FOR CHARACTERS IN SELECTION LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The following problem has been observed with the Paper Keyboard software
 running on the AICS workstation:
  
 While attempting to load a FormSpec file from VISTA, if the FormSpec file
 contains either the quote character (") or the backslash character (\), an
 error will be reported and the loading of the file will abort.
 (NOIS: PRO-0997-10680)
  
 This patch contains routine IBDFM1 which translates both the quote
 character and the backslash character to the grave character (`) in an
 encounter form block. Note that the translation will not affect encounter
 form printing of these characters, the substitute grave character will be
 stored internally in the FORM SPECS file (#359.2).
  
 This patch also contains post-install routine IBDY313 that will uncompile
 all entries in the ENCOUNTER FORM file (#357) to include the translation
 of these characters in the encounter forms when they are recomplied. The
 encounter forms are recompiled as they are printed.
  
 If this patch is installed during the normal work day it is recommended 
 that the following menu options (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible 
 conflicts during the installation.  Other DHCP users will not be affected.
