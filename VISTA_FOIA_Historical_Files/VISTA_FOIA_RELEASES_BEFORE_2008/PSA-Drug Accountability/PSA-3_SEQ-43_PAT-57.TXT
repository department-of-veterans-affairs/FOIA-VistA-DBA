 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =====================
 HD0000000120170   Post Verify e-mail not received
  
 Problem:
 --------
  User reports that the Post Verify e-mail is not being received after
  installing PSA*3*53 on 11/8.  When changes did occur in the drug file 
  such as (change NDC, price/order unit, price/dispense unit, & dispense
  unit/order unit) and is in the pre-verify e-mail.  Currently PSAVER6
  routine executes the e-mail logic after the invoice updates have been 
  applied.  This results on no variances being found and no e-mail being
  sent.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  PSAVER6 routine will be modified to execute the Post Verify variance
  e-mail logic before performing any updates.  This will ensure that the
  changes to the invoice are reported accurately.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
  PSAVER6 routine will be modified to run the Post Verify variance e-mail
  logic before making any updates.  PSAVER6 routine lines STRAT+17 thru
  START+22 will be moved to START+3.
