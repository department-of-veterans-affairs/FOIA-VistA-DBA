 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 Patch PSA*3*12 made a code change that is causing the selection of a 
 location to generate an undefined error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The necessary code has been put back into place.
  
 COMPONENTS:
 ===========
 N/A
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 Patch PSA*3*12 removed the character 'Z' from the variable DIC(0) which 
 tells the call in selecting a location, to bring back the value of the 
 name of the location in the variable Y(0,0). Y(0,0) is looked for in the 
 program after the DIC(0). Without that character the location name is not 
 put into Y(0,0) and that variable is undefined.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
 The character 'Z' has been put back into the variable DIC(0).
