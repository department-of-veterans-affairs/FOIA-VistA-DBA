Description:
============

  1. When a pick list contains one or more orders for which there is
  an inconsistency between the number of dispense drugs associated with
  the order and the number of dispense drug index entries associated with
  the order, a MailMan message is generated incorrectly stating that a
  problem exists with a DRUG file (#50) entry. A message generated in
  this way may be identified by the display of numbers separated by
  commas, rather than the name of the drug.
  
  Example:
      The following items from your DRUG file were found to have NO DATA in
      their PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field:
           1234567,123,1
  
        Any PICK LIST with any of these items will NOT be completely FILED
      AWAY until the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field has been entered into
      for these items.
        Even if there is no cost for these items, a zero (0) must be
      entered into the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field so the package knows
      it is not an error or an omission.  UNTIL THIS IS DONE, NO COST
      REPORT WILL BE ACCURATE, AND ANY PICK LIST WITH THESE ITEMS CANNOT BE
      PURGED.
  
  With this patch, this MailMan message will not be generated due to an 
  extraneous or orphan dispense drug index entry associated with an
  order. HD0000000068561.
  
  2. To assist in preventing problems with dispense drugs of renewed
  orders, the ability to delete dispense drugs from a pending renewal will
  be removed. Functionality will be added to allow dispense drugs to be
  inactivated for pending renewal orders. HD0000000068561.
