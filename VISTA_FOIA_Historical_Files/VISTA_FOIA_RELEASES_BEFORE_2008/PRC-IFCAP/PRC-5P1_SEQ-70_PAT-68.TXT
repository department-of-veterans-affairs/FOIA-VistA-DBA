Subject: PROSTHETICS GUI TO IFCAP API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains four routines that are used as integration between 
 Prosthetics and IFCAP for the Prosthetics GUI Purchasing Interface. The 
 request for the changes in this patch came from The Prosthetics Program
 Office in Washington DC, from recommendations by the Prosthetics
 Data Validation Workgroup.
  
  
 1. Routine, PRCH7PA4 allows for an interface to look-up the following:
       a. Line label ENA - All Purchase Cards available to a user (as a
          card holder or surrogate) 
       b. Line label END - Fund Control Point check user
  
 2. Routine, PRCH7PA1 is the GUI equivalent to the old entry point and 
    routine; ADD^PRCH7B for adding a new purchase order to file 
    #442,PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS.
  
 3. Routine, PRCH7PUC is the GUI equivalent to the old entry point and 
    routine; OBL^PRCH7B for a noninteractive obligation of the purchase
    order from the information gathered and sent from the Prosthetics GUI
    application. This new routine PRCH7PUC eliminates the need for the
    Input Template [PRCH PROSTHETIC].
  
 4. Routine, PRCUESIG has a check for IFCAP's Prosthetics variable 
    PRCRMPR to quit the Roll and Scroll Electronic Signature functionality
    so Prosthetics can use a GUI supported Electronic Signature process.
