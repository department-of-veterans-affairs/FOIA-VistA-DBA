Associated patches: (v)MPIF*1*35   <<= must be installed BEFORE `MPIF*1*37'

Subject: CHANGE TO IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FIELDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating
  Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*35 is a required build for patch MPIF*1*37.
   
  Routines MPIFAPI and MPIFAPI1:
  In an earlier patch, MPIF*1*28, selected identifying fields in
  the PATIENT (#2) file were asked early in the Registration Intake
  process, so the information would be available for the query to
  the Master Patient Index (MPI) system.  Code was added in routine
  MPIFAPI to accomplish this.  This Application Programmer Interface
  (API) was called by the Registration options to ask for the
  identifying fields.
   
  Patch MPIF*1*37 modifies the prompts in the API for identity
  management fields.  It will only ask for selected fields if they
  are blank or imprecise, in accordance with the following business
  rules.
   
  The API affects ONLY those fields that are displayed starting with
  the prompt: "Please verify or update the following information:"
  The API concludes when you enter the registration screens.
    
  The following identity management fields will be asked in the API
  only if they were previously blank.
      - Date of Birth
      - Sex
      - Social Security Number
      - Multiple Birth Indicator
      - Mother's Maiden Name
      - Place of Birth (City, State)
      - Alias
  AND
  Date of Birth will be prompted if it contains an imprecise date.
  Social Security Number will be prompted if it is a pseudo number.
  AND
  Mother's Maiden Name and Place of Birth (City, State) will be prompted
  if the free text field contains imprecise information (e.g., UNKNOWN,
  NOT AVAILABLE, NOT GIVEN, NOT KNOWN, UNAVAILABLE, or DECEASED, etc.)
      
  The UPDATE module was moved out of routine MPIFAPI into MPIFAPI1,
  because the routine was becoming too large.
    
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD) VISTA, USER
  MANUAL is available in two formats.
   
      RG1_0_UM.PDF                    RG1_0_UM.DOC
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
  be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.
   
  1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
         
  2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state.
    
  3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will not have to
      disable mapping.
   
  4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
      Note:  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
      the patch text only.
   
  5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      MPIF*1.0*37.
