 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1. UNY-0204-11518 - Problem with adt - DG*5.3*553 
  
    Problem
    -------
    Sites are experiencing performance issues due to dangling tasks in
    Taskman.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Routines VAFCCCAP and VAFHCCAP were modified to remove the tasks from 
    Taskman after completion.
  
    Routine DGSEC has been modified to call Mailman directly. This will
    remove the tasks after they complete.
  
 2. ISP-0304-N0241 - Duplicate ISO bulletin & log entry
  
    Problem
    -------
    When adding a spouse or dependent, duplicate ISO bulletins and log
    entries are being created.

    Routine DGSEC has been modified to prevent the duplicate bulletins.
  
 3. ISP-0604-N0426 - DGSEC Tasking Bulletins to Mailman
  
    Problem
    -------
    Any time a sensitive patient is accessed, DGSEC uses a call to EN^XMB
    which tasks the bulletin.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    DGSEC has been modified to call Mailman directly. This will
    remove the tasks after they complete.

 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: When running XINDEX some sites may see the following errors:
 DGSEC
    Q+6   F - Reference to routine '^A7RDPACT'. That isn't in this UCI.
    Q+8   F - Reference to routine '^MPRCHK'. That isn't in this UCI.
   
 The fatal errors are for routines that may or may not be in sites UCI. 
 DGSEC will check for their existence and if they are not found, it will
 continue processing. MPRCHK was removed from sites in patch MPR*1.0*6.
 A7RDPACT is for National Database Integration routines. These references
 were already in the routine and are being left there as sites may possibly
 have either routine installed.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the Registration package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*582):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*582.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond Yes.
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',

          Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT]
     When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     hit enter.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
