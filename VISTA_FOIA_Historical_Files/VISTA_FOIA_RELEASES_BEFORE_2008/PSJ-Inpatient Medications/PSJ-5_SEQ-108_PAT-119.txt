Subject: OPTION TO ROUND UP FRACTIONAL DOSES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Description :
  ============
 1) A site reported a problem that occurs when the pick list is sent to the
    ATC. It does not round up and the ATC will not accept fractional units
    so the drug does not go to the ATC.  This patch corrects this situation
    by providing an optional system parameter to allow rounding of
    fractional doses before sending to the ATC.  NOIS ALT-0403-20970
  
 2) A site reported a problem during testing where partial or 1/2 tabs,
    that are being rounded up, were not showing up on the pick list.
    An evaluation of the new Round ATC Pick List parameter was added
    to the Pick List Report to correct it.
