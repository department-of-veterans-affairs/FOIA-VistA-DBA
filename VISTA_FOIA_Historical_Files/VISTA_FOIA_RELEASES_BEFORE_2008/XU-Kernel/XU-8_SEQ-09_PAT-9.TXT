Subject: XQ, XQ12, XUS1 - Menu template problems

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Patch XU*8*9 corrects the following problems:
   
 1.  The LOGIN menu template which is supposed to run automatically the
 first time a user logs on each day (assuming the user has created one) was
 looking at the wrong date, consequently it never ran.  This problem was
 reported in NOIS MAD-1095-40743.
  
 2.  Jump starting menu templates by entering ACCESS CODE; VERIFY CODE;
 [<template name> was not working.  The user was instead dropped into the
 primary menu. This problem was reported in NOIS SPO-1095-50200.
  
 These routines are heavily used and are usually mapped on most systems
 that allow mapping.
  
 =====================================================================
 INSTALLATION: 
   1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping, 
       so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
   3.  Answer NO to the question: 
       'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?' 
   4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
       'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines 
       have the correct checksums.  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
       'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XU*8.0*9' and proceed 
       with install.  
   7.  If you are a MSM site move the routines to the other servers.  
   8.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
