Description:
============

 This patch contains the following enhancement and problem resolution:
  
 Within the New Clinic Visits [ACKQAS VISIT ENTRY] and Edit an Existing 
 Visit [ACKQAS VISIT EDIT] options, if a patient has more than twenty-two
 Rated Disabilities, the display will scroll off the top of the screen.  A
 change has been made to display the multiple Rated Disabilities one screen

 A HINQ  project is under development which will increase the maximum
 number of Service Connected Rated Disabilities returned from Veteran
 Benefits Administration(VBA) from 6 to  150.  It has always been possible
 to add an unlimited number of Rated  Disabilities to a veteran Patient
 file.  But when the Health Eligibility Center (HEC)  gets an update from
 VBA it sends out an update messages to the veteran's sites of record.
  
 The disability information at the site is replaced by HEC's  information
 and limited to 6 disabilities. It is important for  health care providers 
 to be able to see if a condition being treated is Service Connected.  So
 the QUASAR code should be reviewed to ensure that it  can handle up to 150
 disabilities, and the screen and print formats should  be checked to see
 if they need page breaks or screen pauses. 
  
  
 Display and print changes
 ========================= 
 The following QUASAR master menu options now display unlimited multiple
 Rated Disabilities without scrolling out of the viewable screen display
 and print with appropriate page breaks.
