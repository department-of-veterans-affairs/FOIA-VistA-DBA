    modifies the Nurse Intraoperative Report [SRONRPT] option to 
    display and to allow editing of the following additional information
    related to medications:
      Time Administered
      Route
      Dosage
      Ordered By
      Administered By
      Medication Comments
  
 2. The Morbidity & Mortality Reports [SROMM] option and the M&M 
    Verification Report [SRO M&M VERIFICATION REPORT] option are 
    modified to display the sepsis category for SYSTEMIC SEPSIS
    occurrences.
  
 3. This patch modifies the DYSPNEA field (#325) in the SURGERY file 
    (#130) changing MINIMAL EXERTION in the set of choices to MODERATE 
    EXERTION. This change makes the field description agree with the 
    set of codes.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed with Surgery users off the system.
 Installation takes less than two minutes. Installation of this patch
 may be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*143):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*143.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
