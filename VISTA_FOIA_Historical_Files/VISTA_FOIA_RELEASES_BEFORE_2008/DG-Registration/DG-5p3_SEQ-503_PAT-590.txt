  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four problems in PTF.
  
 Problem #1:  When displaying a patient whose record has been closed in the
 Load/Edit PTF Record option, an error occurs trying to open the 701 screen.
 This error can only be displayed for a patient who has at least one open
 PTF record.  This error was documented in NOISes DAY-0304-41336 and
 HWH-0304-41431.
  
 Problem #2:  When a CPT record is deleted, the date and time of that CPT
 can't be used for another CPT record.
  
 Problem # 3:  When displaying a record in Inquire Patient, the procedure
 and/or surgery information will sometimes scroll off the top of the screen.
 This was documented in NOIS DAN-0304-41387.
  
 Problem #4:  The surgery section of the MAS screen displays ICD9 diagnosis
 codes instead of ICD0 procedure codes.  This was documented in NOIS
 DAN-0304-41387.
