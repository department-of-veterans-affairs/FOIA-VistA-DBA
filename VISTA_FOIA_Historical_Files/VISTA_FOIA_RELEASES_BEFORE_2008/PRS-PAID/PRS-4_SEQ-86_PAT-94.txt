Subject: PRESIDENT REAGAN FUNERAL (06/11/04) - GOVERNMENT CLOSING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 President George W. Bush issued an Executive order to close all Federal 
 offices on Friday, June 11, 2004, to allow Federal employees to join their
 fellow citizens in remembering Ronald W. Reagan, the fortieth President 
 of the United States.  For purposes of pay and leave, June 11, 2004, is 
 being treated as a holiday.
  
 VA Central Office employees will be excused from duty for the scheduled 
 workday on Friday, June 11, 2004.  Employees who, in the judgment of the 
 head of the agency, cannot be excused for reasons of national security, 
 defense, or other essential public business, will not be excused from 
 duty.
  
 Post Install routine PRSXP94 will check Pay Period 04-11 to determine 
 if the holiday can be added to this pay period.
  
 Depending on the tours of duty worked by the employee the rules may 
 dictate adding the extra holiday to the next pay period.
  
 If Pay Period 04-12 has not been opened when this patch is installed, any 
 holidays that need to be posted in that pay period will be posted as the 
 pay period is opened.
  
 If Pay Period 04-12 has been opened when this patch is installed, the 
 PRSXP94 routine will make a second pass through PP 04-12 and will
 automatically post the extra holiday for employees who should have the
 holiday posted in this pay period.
