Subject: Check For Duplicate Sub-File Entries & Dialog Removal

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   When FileMan option Check/Fix DD Structure[DI DDUCHK] was used to check 
 the DD structure, there were conditions that were not being checked.  For 
 example, a missing file header, duplicate sub-file numbers, duplicate 
 global locations for data.  The following is a list of the new conditions 
 and Data Base Server API
