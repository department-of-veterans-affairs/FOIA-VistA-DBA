Subject: BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 The Registration application has released enhancements designed to
 provide a more accurate and cleaner update of the patient address. One
 of the things included in the enhancements is the automatic population
 of city, state, and county based on entry of a zip code. For more
 detailed information about this and the other enhancements recently 
 released by the Registration application, please refer to the patch 
 description of DG*5.3*522.
   
 This patch is responsible for updating Outpatient Pharmacy with the new
 functionality made available by the Registration application. More
 specifically, the update of the patient permanent address through the
 Outpatient Pharmacy application will be enhanced with the new 
 functionality that was recently released by the Registration application
 with the patch DG*5.3*522.
  
 For sites that have patch IVM*2*108 installed, the address history will 
 be captured in the IVM ADDRESS CHANGE LOG File (#301.7).
  
 Two places in the Outpatient Pharmacy application will be affected by
 this change:
  
  1) Menu option: Update Patient Record [PSO PAT] option
  2) Patient Information screen, option PU - Patient Record Update
  
  Note: The Patient Information screen can be reached through the Patient
        Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option and the
        Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option.
  
 The examples below show how the patient permanent address edit was before
 and how it is going to be changed after this patch is installed:

     NOTES:
     =====
     1) Multiple ":"'s above indicate that other fields have been 
        suppressed to abbreviate the example.
     2) <RET> indicates the <RETURN> key.
     3) <DISPLAY> indicates that the field was displayed and was not 
        editable.
     4) BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR is a new field introduced by the 
        Registration application. For more information on this field,
        please refer to the documentation for that application.
  
     IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE:
     ==============================
     - A new prompt "Do you want to update the Permanent address/phone? 
       //N" will be displayed before editing the permanent address/phone 
       information to give the user a chance to skip it. If the user
       responds with "N", the control will go to the CNH CURRENT field 
       (#148) of the PATIENT file (#2) prompt. Otherwise, the user will go
       through editing the address/phone information fields.
  
     - When entering a new or updating an existing patient permanent
       address, the information is not saved to the database until the
       prompt above "Are you sure that you want to save the above changes?"
       is answered YES. If the application times out or an '^' (up-arrow)
       is entered in any of the permanent address fields above, the changes
       are NOT saved.
