  NOTE: An overview of this patch will be provided on the National IRM 
  Call scheduled for 02/22/06. 
  
  This patch will enhance the Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point
  Activity, Accounting, and Procurement (IFCAP) package to capture 
  Purchase Order (PO) Activity and Generic Inventory Package (GIP) module
  data so the data can be rolled up at the Veterans Integrated Services
  Network (VISN) and national levels for analysis by the Prosthetic and
  Clinical Logistics Office (PCLO).
    
  This patch contains routines that use existing FileMan Application 
  Program Interfaces (API) to create delimited flat files from the IFCAP 
  application and the GIP module. The GIP extract is performed on the first
  day of the month. It extracts data from the first day of the previous 
  month to the last day of the previous month. The results are stored 
  in the FileMan CLRS REPORT STORAGE (#446.7) file.
   
  The PO Activity extract is initiated on the 15th day of each month. It
  extracts data from the first day of the finalized data month two months
  (previous) to the last calendar day of that month. The transactions 
  are pulled from the PO ACTIVITY (#442) file.
   
  Once complete, the extracts are transmitted on the 15th of the month via
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the Clinical Logistics Report Server 
  (CLRS).
   
  The field station (each facility) must have at least 10 Megabytes (MB) 
  of memory in its Operating System (OS) available for the extract. Also,
  TaskMan and MailMan must be running prior to the initiation of the 
  extract.
    
  New Application Coordinator Option and System Parameter Definitions
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Added to the IFCAP Application Coordinator menu [PRCHUSER COORDINATOR]
  will be a new submenu, Clinical Logistics Office menu [PRCPLO CLO MENU],
  that adds three new options:
   
  [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT], manual initiation to extract the PO data 
  [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION], manual initiation to extract the GIP data 
  [PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM], allows modification to the four parameter 
  definitions by IRM staff and is restricted to those who hold the 
  security key, XUPROG.
   
  The menu option [PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM] will allow access to the four
  new parameter definitions enabling each site to adjust the range of GIP
  reporting covered by the extracts (coordinated by the PCLO). The
  parameter definitions are:
   
  PRCPLO GREATER THAN RANGE (default setting of 90)
  PRCPLO INACTIVITY RANGE (default setting of 90)
  PRCPLO REPORT RANGE (default setting of 180)
  PRCPLO EXTRACT DIRECTORY (no default setting provided)
   
  The post install routine, PRC5183P, will initialize these parameters to
  their default definitions. Then PRC5183P is automatically deleted.
   
  The [PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM] option will allow IRM to edit these 
  parameters as required by the PCLO.
   
  The PRCPLO EXTRACT DIRECTORY parameter identifies the directory at the 
  OS level where the extract files will be stored for transfer.
   
  Notifications of process status are distributed to users via the newly 
  added PRCPLO CLRS NOTIFICATIONS mail group and users must be added to 
  this mail group to receive notifications of successful processing or
  exception cases.  
   
  Documentation Updates:
  ----------------------
  Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via FTP (using BIN mode).  
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
  also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines:              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City:     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

  Pre-Installation Overview
  -------------------------
   
  The Pre Installation Instructions detail how the System Manager is to 
  create the extract directory for the CLRS. The extract directory will
  temporarily contain the station-level data that will be transferred to
  the CLRS during the FTP process.  
   
  Post Installation Overview
  --------------------------
   
  The Post Installation Instructions specify how to schedule the options
  installed with PRC*5.1*83, the users that should be added to the new mail
  group, and gives examples of the extract directory parameter setup and
  validation of that setup.
   
   
 ***************** PRE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *****************
    
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP THE EXTRACT DIRECTORY FOR THE CLRS
  --------------------------------------------------------------
    
  Patch PRC*5.1*83 was created to extract and transmit PO Activity and 
  GIP module data from each station to a centrally located Report Server
  employed by the PCLO.
   
  In order for each station to communicate with the CLRS, it is
  important to establish an extract directory to transfer station-
  level data to the CLRS.
    
  The following steps MUST be performed by the System Manager, because
  Administrative privileges (for VMS or MS Windows OSs) are needed in 
  order to perform the tasks required.  
    
  Perform all steps relevant to your OS prior to installing this patch.
    
  1. Security Keys and Privileges
     ----------------------------
      You will need the following system access or privileges:
      Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming 
      System (MUMPS) Programmer
   
      Virtual Memory System (VMS) or Microsoft (MS) Windows/New Technology
      (NT) Administrator.
   
  2.  Station Number Identification
      -----------------------------
  NOTE:  Perform this step for each instance of Cache running on
         your server(s) (single or multiple instances).
   
       You should be at the Programmer prompt:  >
   
       You will need to obtain the station number from your system.  
    
  NOTE:  When your system was configured, a unique number was assigned 
         to the configuration (single station sites and multi-division 
         facilities).
   
       In order to obtain the station number (used to name the 
       directory), type the following two commands at the programmer 
       prompt:
    
  > S Y=$$GET1^DIQ(4,$$KSP^XUPARAM("INST")_",",99) [Enter]
  > W Y [Enter]
  > 500
    
  NOTE:  In this example, the site number returned is 500.
         The command you entered MUST return a site number (which is 
         set in the variable Y).
    
  3.  Extract Directory Setup
      -----------------------
  NOTE:  The naming convention for directories is different for each OS.
         Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular OS.
          
      a.  Cache / VMS Sites
   
  NOTE:  The proposed naming convention is a recommendation. A more 
         knowledgeable and experienced System Manager may choose to setup 
         the extract directory using existing drives and definitions. The
         directory name chosen must have the appropriate READ, WRITE, 
         EXECUTE, and DELETE privileges.
    
          1)  Set up a VMS Directory named USER$:[CLRSxxx] where xxx is 
              the station number. 
              In our example, the name of the directory would be:  
              USER$:[CLRS500] (station number obtained in step 2).
   
  NOTE:  This directory will store approximately 10MB of data each month,
         but will be purged of existing data when the next monthly extract
         occurs.  
   
          2)  The new directory MUST have READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, and DELETE
              privileges for the currently installed Cache instance.  
              You must have administrator privileges when you perform this
              task in order to assure the directory is setup/created with 
              the necessary permissions.
    
  Following is an example for you to follow to set up the extract 
  directory.
    
  NOTE:  The owner of the directory should be CACHEMGR.
    
  $ CREATE/DIRECTORY DISK$:[CLRSnnn] /own=CACHEMGR
  /PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED,G:RWED,W:RWED)/LOG
    
  NOTE:  Where DISK$=the disk of your choice (e.g. USER$, PQ$, etc. - SYS$
         is not recommended) and xxx=the station number.
    
          3)  Following is an example of the SPOOL directory which is
              presently configured on your Cache / VMS system. Also, these
              commands may be performed in VMS to view the SPOOL directory.
   
  NOTE:  Confirm that the extract directory has similar protections and
         permissions 
    
  $ dir user$:[000000]spool.dir/sec
    
  Directory USER$:[000000]
    
  SPOOL.DIR;1          [CACHEMGR]                       
  (RWED,RWED,RWED,RWED)
  (IDENTIFIER=*,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE)
    
  NOTE:  After the extract directory set up is complete, provide the 
         directory name to the IRM IFCAP Application support person 
         responsible for the installation of this patch. The extract 
         directory name will be entered into the PRCPLO EXTRACT
         DIRECTORY system parameter during patch installation.
    
      b.  Cache / MS Windows or NT Sites
   
  NOTE:  The proposed naming convention is a recommendation. A more 
         knowledgeable and experienced System Manager may choose to setup 
         the extract directory using existing drives and definitions. The 
         directory name chosen must have the appropriate READ, WRITE, 
         EXECUTE, and DELETE privileges.
   
          1)   Set up an MS Windows directory named D:\CLRSxxx where xxx 
               is the station number.
               In our example, the name of the directory would be:  
               D:\CLRS500 (station number obtained in step 2).
   
  NOTE:  This directory will store approximately 10MB of data each month. 
         But will be purged of existing data when the next monthly extract
         occurs.  
   
          2)  The new directory MUST have READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, and DELETE
              privileges for the currently installed MS Windows instance.
              You must have administrator privileges when you perform this
              task in order to assure the directory is setup/created with 
              the necessary permissions.

  1.  Mail Group Notification
      -----------------------
      Notifications of process status are distributed to users via the 
      newly added PRCPLO CLRS NOTIFICATIONS mail group and users must be
      added to this group to receive notifications of successful processing
      or exception cases.  
   
      The following individuals should be added to this newly created mail
      group: IFCAP IRM support staff, IFCAP Application Coordinators, and 
      Supply Systems Analysts responsible for the transmission of the GIP
      data to the PCLO.
   
  2.  Option Scheduling
       -----------------
      Schedule the options to run via the TaskManager by using the 
      Schedule/Unschedule option, [XUTM SCHEDULE]. The options should be 
      set to run using the following values (time displayed is local):
   
      a.  [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION] should be queued to run on the first day
          of the month at midnight (12:00am), with a rescheduling 
          frequency of "1M" indicating a monthly job, and a special 
          queuing value of "P" indicating a persistent task.
   
      b.  [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT] should be queued to run on the 15th day
          of the month at 7:00pm, with a rescheduling frequency of "1M" 
          indicating a monthly job, and a special queuing value of "P" 
          indicating a persistent task.
   
  3.  Extract Directory Parameter Setup
      ---------------------------------
      Use the [PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM] option to set up the PRCPLO EXTRACT
      DIRECTORY. Be sure to coordinate appropriately with the staff 
      responsible for the extract directory setup from the Pre-Installation
      Instructions. Remember, the [PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM] option is only
      available to those who hold the XUPROG security key.
       
  NOTE:  In the following example, the PRCPLO EXTRACT DIRECTORY parameter 
         is changed from a blank value to $1$DGA2:[ANONYMOUS.CLRS].
         THIS VALUE IS NOT a valid entry for your site. Every station's
         extract directory will be determined by that station's
         system administrator.

  Final FTP Setup complete, beginning FTP Transfer
    
  The file transfer to the report server has been initiated.
  You will be receiving a notification that the FTP
  process has completed. The notification message
  should be received within the hour.  If you do not
  receive the FTP process has completed message,
  please contact IRM. IRM can confirm the process
  is still running by performing the following
  command:
    
  At the MUMPS Programmer prompt, type D ^%SS
    
  See if there are any PRCHLO* routines running.
    
  If these routines are present, the process is still
  running. If you waited one hour, and did not get the
  FTP process has completed message, a problem
  was encountered. Further troubleshooting can be
  performed by examining the LOGFILE CLRSxxxFTP1.LOG
  where xxx is your station ID#. The logfile is
  located in the following directory: $1$DGA2:[ANONYMOUS.CLRS]
