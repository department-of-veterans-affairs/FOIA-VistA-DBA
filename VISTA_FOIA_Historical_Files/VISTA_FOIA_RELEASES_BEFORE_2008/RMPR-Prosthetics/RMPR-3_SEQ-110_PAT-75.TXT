Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 1) This patch is the first version of a Graphical User interface (GUI) for
 the Prosthetics Laboratory.  It consist of a KIDS build and an Executable.
  
 2) When picking a Purchase Card, if the PC USER SINGLE PURCHASE LIMIT, 
 MONTHLY PURCHASE LIMIT, MONTHLY PURCHASES were returned as a null the 
 Purchasing Agent would get the error 'IS NOT A VALID FLOATING POINT 
 VALUE'. This has been fixed.   HD119461
  
 3) It was discovered that one could copy and paste a string of characters 
 that were to long in the following free text fields:
 Attn:  (for delivery)
 Brief Desc:
 Remarks
 Manufacturer
 Model
 Seriel#
 Lot#
 The fields have fixed lengths that the text will be limited to, and
 anything beyond that will not be filed.
  
 4) In the past the routine ^RMPR9DO was used for the Delayed Order Report 
 and the Purchase Order Control Screen.  In order to make sure future 
 variations do not have any negative cross over effects we have created a 
 new routine ^RMPR9PU that will be used for the Purchase Order Control 
 screen exclusively.
  
 5) When closing out a remote work order an error would occur because the 
 Shipping Date was not asked.  The Shipping Date is being removed with 
 Patch 75 so this will not be an issue.  Main Remedy HD133568
  
 6) In the Work Order print routine ^RMPR29R a look-up to file 4 could 
 error if there was not an exact match.  The look-up has been fixed to 
 find an exact match.  Remedy HD56585
  
 7) We are including a post install routine ^RMPRP75 with this patch to
 eliminate the error in XDRMERG0 when merging 2 patients.  The merge
 process errored when getting to the Prosthetics package file entry (9.4)
 and there was no executable routine defined.  The bogus Package File entry
 for Prosthetics was a result of a KIDS build for current patches that did
 not clear the Package File "Affects Record Merge" field. This patch will
 clear the bogus node that the merge process found in the Package File
 (9.4) for Prosthetics.
  
 8) It was discovered at our test site at Atlanta that there may be some 
 bad data left over in the zero node of the 664.1 file in piece 8 that 
 should not be there.  It is unknown what the source was, but file 664.1 
 will be checked and if bad data is found it will be removed in the
 Pre-Install routine RMPRWOFX.

 Known Anonymities
 =================
  
 If a work order is being canceled and has more than one material and the 
 clone check box is checked an      <UNDEF>DIK+3^DIK  occurs. 
  
 Risk/Impact:
  
 Low  does not present a patient safety risk.  The cancellation of a work 
 order primarily occurs prior to the involvement of the patient.  This 
 error will only happen when canceling a work order and will only happen 
 if there is more than one material added to the work order. 
  
 Workaround: 
  
 If a work order needs to be canceled , and it has more than one material 
 delete all but one material and then cancel the Work Order and there will 
 not be an error. A memo will be sent to the users with the release of the 
 patch explaining the problem and the work around.
  
 "T  temporary work orders should not allow material and labor updates and 
 currently are allowed to, causing     a NUL SUBSCRIPT A2+8^RMPR29MG
  
 Risk/Impact:
  
 Low  does not present a patient safety risk.  The T designation for 
 Temporary Work Orders that are sent to another site is a known 
 designation.  Instructions will be sent out to alert the field to not 
 pick any of these work orders form the screen 
  
 Workaround
  
 Don t pick any of the Work Orders with the T designation from the GUI 
 Work Order screen.  These are Work Orders that have been sent out and 
 should not be worked on at the site anyway. A memo will be sent to the 
 users with the release of the patch explaining the problem and the work 
 around.
  
 508 Compliance
 ==============
 The Prosthetics executable is not 508 compliant.
 Working with the 508 team to establish 508 compliance.
 508 Compliance is underway and will be in a future patch.
