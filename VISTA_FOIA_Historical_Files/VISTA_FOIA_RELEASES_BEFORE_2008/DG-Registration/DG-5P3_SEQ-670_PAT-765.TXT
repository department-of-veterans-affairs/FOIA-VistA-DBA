Subject: UPDATE Z07 CHECK FIELD IN FILE #38.6

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
 The Registration consistency check (CC) 72, MSE DATA MISSING/INCOMPLETE, 
 requires that the Military Service Episode (MSE) data for Branch of 
 Service, Service Entry Date, Service Separation Date, and Discharge Type 
 not be missing or incomplete. The Registration consistency check 74, 
 CONFLICT DATE IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE, requires that the Conflict From 
 and To Dates contain at least a month and year. The Registration 
 consistency check 81, COMBAT DT NOT WITHIN MSE, requires that the Combat 
 From and To Dates be within the patient's Military Service Episode (MSE). 
 With the implementation of patch DG*5.3*653, these consistency checks 
 also prevent a Z07 HL7 message from being sent to the Health 
 Eligibility Center (HEC).  The presence of a large number of existing 
 Military Service Data with missing or incomplete MSE data, only a year in 
 the conflict dates, and combat dates not within the MSE is preventing 
 patient data from reaching the HEC.  This patch contains a post-install 
 routine that will update a field in the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file 
 #38.6, and allow the Z07 messages to be sent even if CC 72, 74 or 81 is 
 present.
  
 VHA Directive 2007-019, VETERANS HEALTH INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY 
 ARCHITECTURE (VISTA) CONSISTENCY CHECKS, will be amended to exclude those 
 3 consistency checks from preventing the transmission of the Z07 message 
 to HEC.

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 Problem:
 If a patient has any Military Service Data with incomplete or missing MSE 
 data, incomplete or missing conflict dates, or combat dates that are 
 not within the patient's Military Service Episode, the patient's data 
 will not be sent to HEC because consistency check 72 MSE DATA 
 MISSING/INCOMPLETE, 74 CONFLICT DATE IS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE and 81 
 COMBAT DT NOT WITHIN MSE are set to prevent Z07 messages from being sent.
  
 Solution:
 A post-install routine will update the records for consistency check 72, 
 74 and 81 in the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file #38.6.  Field #6, USE 
 FOR Z07 CHECK, will be changed from 'YES' to 'NO'.
