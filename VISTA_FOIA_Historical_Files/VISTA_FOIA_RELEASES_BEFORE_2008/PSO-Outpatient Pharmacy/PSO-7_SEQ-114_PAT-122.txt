   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
   This patch can be installed with users on the system, but should not be 
   installed while the Edit Data for a Patient in the Clozapine Program
   [PSOL EDIT] option and the Register Clozapine Patient [PSOL REGISTER
   PATIENT] option are in use.  Installation will take no longer than 3
   minutes. There are no other restrictions related to when this patch can 
   be installed.
     
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.

         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
