Description: 
============

 This patch modifies two entries in file 364.7 - IB FORM FIELD CONTENT to 
 address issues with insurance company rejections when Medicare is 
 indicated as the primary insurance and with missing Admit/Discharge dates 
 on outpatient professional claims.  It also modifies the way the provider 
 id is pulled when a care unit is needed and the billing is for the secondary
 coverage on a claim where Medicare is primary.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
   
 1. LIT-1102-70321      Problem W/Box 24K on HCFA Claims
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a Payer (a Blue in this case) who is secondary on a claim that 
    includes MEDICARE coverage requires a special provider id based on a 
    care unit for a professional claim, that id is not being transmitted 
    correctly.  Instead, the default MEDICARE id is transmitted.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects the issue by modifying screen 8 for both UB92 and 
    HCFA to get the correct provider id for a secondary insurance if a care 
    unit is required.
  
 2. WAS-0902-20562      ERROR: DISCHARGE DATE IS REQUIRED
  
    Problem:
    --------
    For outpatient professional claims, not related to an inpatient episode, 
    the Discharge Date was not being filled.  Some payers required an entry 
    in that field.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The program will now output the statement 'To Date' in the Discharge Date
    field for outpatient professional claims.
   
  
 3. CTX-1002-70456      Medicare as Primary Rejecting
  
    Problem:
    --------
    HCFA claims were being rejected when billing the secondary coverage
    where Medicare was primary due to an invalid policy type code being sent.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The output formatter is changed to send the correct code.
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
   
 1.  Changes are made to routines:        IBCEU, IBCSC8H, IBCEP3
     For file #399 -- BILL/CLAIMS FILE
     Changes are made to input templates: IB SCREEN8H, IB SCREEN82
     Changes are made to field 222 -- PROVIDER,
                      sub-fields:  .09     PRIMARY PROV ID CARE UNIT
                                   .1     SECONDRY PROV ID CARE UNIT
                                   .11    TERTIARY PROV ID CARE UNIT
   
 2.  Entry 28 in file 364.7 is affected as follows:
     Field 1-FORMAT CODE is changed
     from:
       K IBXDATA I $G(IBXSAVE("DISDT")) S IBXDATA=$$DT^IBCEFG1(IBXSAVE
       ("DISDT")\1,"","D8")
     to:
       S IBXDATA=$G(IBXSAVE("DISDT")) D:$S(IBXDATA="":'$$INPAT^IBCEF
       (IBXIEN,1),1:0) F^IBCEF("N-STATEMENT COVERS TO DATE",,,IBXIEN) I 
        IBXDATA S IBXDATA=$$DT^IBCEFG1(IBXDATA\1,"","D8")
   
     Field 3-FORMAT CODE DESCRIPTION is changed
     from:
       Extract only date from date/time retrieved from IBXSAVE array 
       previously extracted.  Format date in CCYYMMDD format.  If data
       element's value is null, do not output.
     to:
       Extract only date from date/time retrieved from IBXSAVE array 
       previously extracted.  For an outpatient claim not related to 
       an inpatient episode, output the statement 'To Date'.  
       Format date in CCYYMMDD format.  If data element's value is null,
       do not output.
  
 3.  The data element in VistA's flat file for the Other Insurance Billing
     Provider Id type (OI1-13, mapped to 2330B/REF(3)) was using the 
     INSURANCE CO LEVEL parameter to determine the correct code to send.
     It will now use the POLICY LEVEL parameter as does the corresponding
     data for the CURRENT INSURANCE (CI1-9).
   
     Entry 900 in file 364.7 is affected as follows:  
     Field .03-DATA ELEMENT is changed 
     from:
       234   [N-OTHER INSURANCE CO TYPES]
     to:
       236   [N-OTH INS POL TYPES       ]
   
     Field #1 - FORMAT CODE is changed 
     from: 
       N Z,IBZ M IBZ=IBXDATA K IBXDATA F Z=1,2 I $P($G(IBZ),U,Z),$D(^DGCR
       (399,IBXIEN,"I"_(Z+1))) S IBXDATA(Z)=$P("G2^1C^1D^1H^G2^",U,+$P(IBZ,
       U,Z)) I IBXDATA(Z)="" S IBXDATA(Z)="G2"
     to:
       N A,Z,Q S Q=IBXDATA K IBXDATA F Z=1,2 S A=$P(Q,U,Z) I $D(^DGCR(399,
       IBXIEN,"I"_(Z+1))) S IBXDATA(Z)=$S(A="":"G2","MAMB16"[A:"1C",A="TV"!
       (A="MC"):"1D",A="CH":"1H",A="BL":$S($$FT^IBCEF(IBXIEN)=2:"1B",1:"1A")
       ,1:"G2")
   
     Field #3 - FORMAT CODE DESCRIPTION is changed 
     from:
       This is a group data element so more than 1 occurrence of a value is
       possible for the data element in the IBXDATA array.  If any 'other' 
       insurance company data is found, the data is formatted as the
       insurance type of the insurance company in X12 format.
     to:
       If any 'other' insurance company data is found, the data is formatted
       from the electronic type of plan of the insurance company policy in
       X12 format.  Refer to the 837 V4010 (professional) field
       2330/REF(3)/01 for details.
  
     The pre-init routine, IB20P207, handles the data file changes described
     above in items 2 and 3.
