Subject: INCORRECT MONTHLY DATA STORAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  1. When sites do not process all uploaded invoices, problems arise when 
  the next batch of invoices is uploaded. Drug Accountability attempts to 
  match each item with items in the DRUG file (#50). The process will
  continue to add matching data to the item. If the invoices remain on the  
  system long enough an error will occur.
  
  The solution to this is to bypass the matching process on invoice data 
  that has already been uploaded.  
  
  2. Another problem this patch corrects is with the filing of monthly data 
  on drug items. Monthly data was incorrectly stored for some items in 
  the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8). This patch corrects already 
  affected entries, and restricts the erroneous filing of incorrect data 
  in the future.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Due to the post-installation conversion process, this patch should be 
  installed at non-peak hours.
  
  Installation time varies according to the number of pharmacy locations
  set-up at each facility. Because of the volumes of data to search for
  problems, the installation could take several hours.
  
  Pharmacy users must be off the system during the install.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*31).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3.0*31.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  9. The post installation process should be queued to run when system usage
     is at its lowest point. Below is an example of the process:
  
  EXAMPLE:
  --------
  PSA*3*31 corrects errors that may have occurred while storing monthly data.
  This correction process varies according to the number of pharmacy
  locations.
  
  Therefore it is highly recommended that you queue this task to run at a 
  time when system usage is at a minimum.
  
  Requested Start Time: NOW//
  
  10. After the post-installation routine (PSAP31) runs, it will
      automatically be deleted from your system.
