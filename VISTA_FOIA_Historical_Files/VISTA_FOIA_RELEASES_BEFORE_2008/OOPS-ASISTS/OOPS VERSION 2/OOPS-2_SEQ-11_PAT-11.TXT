Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide minor enhancements to the 
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 300 Log which
 was implemented in OOPS*2.0*7.  This patch will also address 
 other miscellaneous minor enhancements, reported and unreported 
 bug fixes.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000085229     ASISTS GUI violation errors
 HD0000000097259     Reject #1 in address
   
 This patch addresses the following ASISTS TAG requests and E3R's:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  OSHA 300 Log Modifications
     - The report has been modified to include all incident classifications
       entered for a case even if the end date extends past the end 
       date of the report.
     - If there is an incident classification with no incident end  
       date entered but the incident start date falls within the user 
       specified report date range, the report run date will be used
       as the incident end date.
     - Note:  The report still includes all cases whose DATE/TIME OF
       OCCURRENCE (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #4) 
       falls within the Start and End date.  There is no change to 
       that functionality.
  
 2.  Create Accident/Illness Report Option Modifications
     - Six new prompts/questions have been added to this form as follows:
       Was there Loss of Consciousness: Yes/No
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #349)
       Hospitalized overnight as in-patient: Yes/No
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #339)
       Treated in non-VA Emergency Room: Yes/No
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #338)
       Was prescription strength medication ordered/given: Yes/No/Unknown
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #350)
       Was non-prescription strength medication ordered/given at 
            prescription strength: Yes/No/Unknown
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #351)
       Initial return to work status: Full-duty/Days away work (not including
         day of injury)/Job Transfer \ Restriction 
         (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #352)
     - All fields are required and have a default value of 'No' except for 
       the Initial return to work status prompt which is not required and
       does not have a default value.
   
 3.  Complete/Validate/Sign Accident Report (2162)
     - A new prompt/question has been added to the Signatures tab:
       Initial return to work status.  A response must be entered for this
       prompt before the Supervisor can sign the 2162.
       (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #352)
     - Three new prompts/questions were added to the OSHA tab:
         Was there Loss of Consciousness: Yes/No
           (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #349)
         Was prescription strength medication ordered/given: Yes/No/Unknown
           (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #350)
         Was non-prescription strength medication ordered/given at 
           prescription strength:  Yes/No/Unknown
           (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #351)
     - A new prompt/question has been added to the General Settings tab:
       LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], 
       field #348) and is not required.  Valid responses are
       dependent on the response in the LOCATION OF INJURY field (ASISTS
       ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #27). If no entries are 
       loaded in the LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL subfile [#2261.43]  
       then the LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL question is not enabled and the
       text "NO DETAIL LOCATIONS LOADED" will be displayed.
  
 4.  Print Accident Report Status Modifications
     - The supervisor's full name will be printed where 'Supervisor' was 
       printed before in the format "LastName,FirstName, Supervisor".
     - Modified the report to display the date that the employee, 
       supervisor, safety officer, or workers' compensation specialist
       signed the form.  The date the electronic signature was entered 
       will replace the word 'Signed' in the appropriate report column. 
       If the claim has not been signed the report will continue to
       indicate 'Un-signed'.
  
 5.  Dual Benefits Modifications
     - The employee will no longer be required to sign the dual benefit 
       form before signing the CA1 or CA2.
     - A new popup message will ask the user if they are a veteran. If 
       the response is 'No' the appropriate CA form will be displayed 
       for the user.  If the response is 'Yes' the dual benefits form 
       will be displayed for the user to complete.  The 'Are you a Veteran'
       question has been removed from the form and a new question, "Do you 
       refuse to answer the Dual Benefits questions on this form", has been 
       added. (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #353)
       If the user responds 'Yes' to the refusal question, they will not be
       required to respond to the dual benefits questions and can save and exit 
       the dual benefits form to get to the CA form.  If 'No', the user will
       be able to respond to the dual benefit questions and sign the dual 
       benefit form prior to accessing the CA form. The employee will not 
       have to sign the dual benefits form prior to signing the CA form. The 
       functionality for the Workers' Compensation specialist has not been
       changed - they will still have to electronically sign the dual 
       benefit form. 
     - The following text has been added to the bottom of the dual benefits 
       form:  "If you have any questions regarding this form, please contact 
       your Workers Compensation Specialist".
     - Modified error checking on dual benefits form that when user answers
       'Yes' to the refusal question, the system will not require the user to
       answer the two benefit questions on the form when clicking the 
       Sign/Validate button. 
  
 6.  Modifications to the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1
     - A new field called "Reason for Dispute Code" has been added 
       to the Physician tab of the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 option 
       (the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING [# 2260] file, field #347). The 
       following set of dispute codes are the valid response codes 
       and definitions:
       1 - A personal, emotional, reaction to administrative activities
       2 - Different medical opinions about injury; weight of evidence
       3 - Different stories about what happened
       4 - Employee did not follow facility policies/procedures
       5 - Inappropriate medical provider
       6 - Injury was not work related
       7 - Investigation of incident does not support the employee's 
           statement
       8 - Medical diagnosis/treatment not related to claimed condition
       9 - No medical evidence to support work related injury
      10 - Timeliness of reporting incident
  
       If the "Does the agency dispute this claim" question is answered Yes
       (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #165.2), 
       the Reason for Dispute Code field is required and a comment may be
       entered in the "State the Reason for Dispute in Detail" memo field 
       (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field #165).  Note, this 
       prompt/question has been renamed to: "State the Reason in Detail".
  
       The "State the Reason in Detail" question is utilized for both the 
       "Does the agency controvert this claim" (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
       File [#2260], field #165.1) and the "Does the agency dispute this 
       claim".  A reminder is provided that the total number of characters
       allowed for this field is 528 and includes the text from the Reason 
       for Controvert and Reason for Dispute codes. Additionally, if either 
       of these two questions has been answered with 'YES' then the "State 
       the Reason in Detail" is enabled for data entry.  If both these
       questions are answered with a 'NO', then this  field is disabled 
       and data cannot be entered.
  
 7.  Reason for Dispute Report (new)
     - This menu option is only available on the Workers' Compensation Menu.
     - The user will be asked to enter a start date, end date, and either a 
       single station or all stations. A report will be generated that 
       the user can preview to the screen or send to a printer.
     - The report will give a count of the number of each of the following 
       reason for dispute codes for both lost time and no lost time cases:
          A personal, emotional, reaction to administrative activities
          Different medical opinions about injury; weight of evidence
          Different stories about what happened
          Employee did not follow facility policies/procedures
          Inappropriate medical provider
          Injury was not work related
          Investigation of incident does not support the employee's statement
          Medical diagnosis/treatment not related to claimed condition
          No medical evidence to support injury    
          Case disputed, no dispute code entered
       Note: The last item is NOT a dispute code but is included
             to handle possible scenarios.
     - The report will also indicate as a footnote the number of cases 
       in the total count that had data in block 36 (State the reason 
       in detail) and the number of cases not disputed in the report date
       range.
  
 8.  Reason for Controvert Report (new)
     - This menu option is only available on the Workers' Compensation 
       Menu.
     - The user will be asked to enter a start date, end date, and either 
       a single station or all stations. A report will be generated that
       the user can preview to the screen or sent to the printer.
     - The report will give a count of the number of each of the 
       following reason for controvert codes for both lost time and no
       lost time cases:
         The disability was not caused by a traumatic injury
         The employee is a volunteer working without pay or for nominal pay, 
            or a member of the office staff of a former president
         The employee is not a citizen or resident of the United States or 
            Canada
         The injury occurred off the employing agencies premises and the 
            employee was not involved in official off premises duty
         The injury was proximately caused by the employee misconduct, 
            intent to bring about injury or death to self or another person, 
            or intoxication
         The injury was not reported on Form CA-1 within 30 days following 
            the injury
         Work stoppage first occurred 45 days or more following the injury
         The employee initially reported the injury after his or her 
            employment was terminated
         The employee is enrolled in the Civil Air Patrol, Peace Corps, 
            Youth Conservation Corps, Work Study Programs, or other similar 
            groups
         Controvert question checked Yes, but no Controvert Code entered
       Note:  The last item is NOT a controvert code but is included to
              handle possible scenarios. 
     - The report will also indicate in a footnote, the number of cases 
       in the count that had data in block 36 (State the reason in detail)
       and the number of cases not controverted in the report date range. 
 9.  Enter/Edit Detail Location of Injury Option (new)
    - This new option has been added to the Safety Menu and will be used to
      populate the LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL subfile [#2261.431] in the
      ASISTS SETTING OF INJURY [#2261.4] File.
    - The user will first need to select a Station from the list of stations 
      in the ASISTS SITE PARAMETER [#2262] File and then a Location of 
      Injury from the ASISTS SETTING OF INJURY [#2261.4].  Once these two
      fields have been selected, the user can enter up to 30 characters to
      define the LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL (LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL
      subfile [#2261.431], field #.01).
    - Once the user enters or edits data in the Location of Injury Detail 
      field and chooses OK, the new entry appears in the list box.  However, 
      the data will not be saved until the user chooses to Save the form.
    - If the user enters or edits data the Location of Injury Detail field 
      and chooses to Exit the form, the system shall prompt the user to save 
      the changes (only if changes were made).
    - A user may NOT delete the Location of Injury Detail entry.  Deleting 
      a Location of Injury Detail entry would invalidate any existing cases 
      that were linked to the entry.
  
 10. Location of Injury Report (new)
     - A new menu option has been added to the Safety Menu and will produce
       a report that counts the number of cases by TYPE OF INCIDENT (ASISTS
       ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field 3), LOCATION OF INJURY (ASISTS
       ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field 27), and the LOCATION OF INJURY 
       DETAIL (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field XXX).
     - The user will be prompted to enter a start date, end date, and either 
       all stations or a single station.
     - The user will also have ability to print the report in standard or 
       Excel spreadsheet format.
     - If a particular LOCATION OF INJURY entry doesn't have LOCATION OF 
       INJURY DETAIL data defined, the report will show "NO DETAIL ENTERED" 
       under the LOCATION OF INJURY DETAIL column.
 
 11. Modifications to the Request for Compensation form (CA7) 
     functionality.
     - The following fields in Section 15 of the CA7 are required (in 
       the ASISTS COMPENSATION CLAIM (CA7) File, #2264):  WC CA7 TITLE 
       (field #86), AGENCY NAME (field #87), OWCP CONTACT NAME (field 
       #88), OWCP CONTACT TITLE (field #89), OWCP CONTACT PHONE (field 
       #90), OWCP CONTACT FAX (field # 91), and OWCP CONTACT EMAIL 
       (field #92).
     - The following fields will now allow future dates (in the 
       ASISTS COMPENSATION CLAIM (CA7) File, #2264):  CLAIM START DATE 
       (field #11), CLAIM END DATE (field #12), DATE BEGAN OUTSIDE WORK 
       (field #21), DATE END OUTSIDE WORK (field #22), PREV BEN FED 
       ANNUITY START DTE (field #44), DATE EMPLOYEE STOPPED WORK 
       (field #56), IRR WK SCH START DATE (IRREGULAR WORK SCHEDULE 
       subfile, #2264.066, field #1), IRR WK SCH LAST DATE (IRREGULAR 
       WORK SCHEDULE subfile, #2264.066, field #2), COP RECEIVED START 
       DATE (field #74), COP RECEIVED END DATE (field #75), PAY STATUS  
       START DATE (PAY STATUS DURING CLAIM subfile, #2264.077, field #1), 
       PAY STATUS END DATE (PAY STATUS DURING CLAIM subfile, #2264.077, 
       field #2) and the DATE EMPLOYEE RETURNED TO WORK (field #79).
     - A new popup message will be displayed when the employee clicks 
       the Sign/Validate button after successful data validation has 
       occurred.  The message asks the user:  Have you verified that all 
       the dates you have entered are valid?  If so, click YES to proceed, 
       else click NO to cancel.
     - The following paragraph has been added to page 3 of the CA7 form:
       "The authority for requesting this information is 5 U.S.C. 8101 
       et seq. The information will be used to determine entitlement to 
       benefits. Furnishing the requested information is required for 
       the claimant to obtain or retain a benefit. Information 
       collected will be handled and stored in compliance with the Freedom 
       of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended 
       (5 U.S.C. 552a). Failure to furnish the requested information may 
       delay the process, or result in an unfavorable decision or a 
       reduced benefit."
     - A new bulletin will be sent to the OOPS WCP mail group when an 
       employee signs a CA-7.  This bulletin contains the following text:
  
             A CA-7 has been signed by the employee.
  
             Date of Injury / Illness:  date
             Case# 2005-xxxxx
  
             This is a reminder to the Workers' Compensation Staff that all 
             CA-7s are to be submitted to the OWCP within 5 calendar days 
             from the date the employee signed the form. 
  
 12. Remove the Print CA1/CA2 and Print CA7 options from the Employee Menu.
   
 13. Supervisor 2162/CA Reminder pop-up message 
     - When the Supervisor signs a 2162, a new pop-up message will be
       displayed reminding the Supervisor to sign the CA form if it hasn't
       been signed. When the Supervisor signs a CA form, a new pop-up
       message will be displayed if the 2162 hasn't been signed.
 
 This patch addresses the following unreported problems:
 -------------------------------------------------------
 1. Print Report of Accident (2162), the Description of Incident 
    truncates when a long description is entered.  When the
    DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File 
    [#2260], field #28) text exceeds approximately 1700 
    characters the remaining characters are truncated.  A new
    page 4 has been added to this report to accept and print
    the additional characters. 
 2. Print Accident Report Status title did not indicate whether 
    report was run for Open, Closed or Open and Closed cases.
    Patch OOPS*2.0*4 added the ability for the user to select
    Open, Closed or Open and Closed cases but did not include
    this parameter in the report title.  The title now has
    that information.
 3. 'Unable to save changes' error received when the Station 
    name in the Institution file was 30 characters long.   
    ASISTS 'pulls' the duty station and agency information so the
    appropriate fields are auto populated when a CA1 or CA2 
    if first generated.  When a Station name (INSTITUTION
    File [#4], field .01) was 30 characters long, the user 
    was unable to save either a CA1 or CA2 if the DUTY STATION
    (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], field 176 or 237)
    or AGENCY NAME (ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File [#2260], 
    field 130 or 230) fields were not edited.  This has been 
    corrected.
 4. The cancel button did not function properly in the
    Enter/Edit OSHA 300A Summary option.  When the cancel
    button was clicked in the Station Panel section, the 
    previous value in the SIC and NAICS fields were not 
    restored.  This has been resolved.
 5. When entering a future date in the Estimated Return Date field 
    on the Classify Incident Outcome option, an 'Invalid Date' 
    error occurred.  This has been corrected so that no error 
    occurs when entering a future date into this field.
 6. The last day (End Date) for which a user may run the Log of 
    Federal Injuries & Illnesses (OSHA 200 Log) report is currently 
    12/31/05.  However, when entering an End Date after 12/31/05 to 
    run this report, an error message would incorrectly display that 
    it cannot be printed or run after 12/31/04.  The text of this error 
    message has been updated to correctly state the last possible End 
    Date to run or print this report is 12/31/05 instead of 12/31/04.
 7. Modified hint messages for Dependent fields in the Request  
    for Compensation (CA7) form.  In the Request for Compensation 
    (CA7) option, the dependent hint message has been changed from 
    "Is Relationship living with you needs to be answered" to "Dependent 
    Living with you question must be answered."  Also, "The Dependents 
    Name cannot be blank..." has been changed to "Dependent's Name cannot 
    be blank..."
 8. Modified the Create Accident/Illness Report (2162) so that if a 
    user starts completing a 2162  for an employee or non-PAID employee 
    but doesn't save the 2162, a security bulletin is sent to the ISO since 
    the user viewed an employee's personal information but didn't create a 
    case or 2162.
 9. Fix mouse over help information in the Complete/Validate/Sign 2162 option:
    Is this a Privacy Case mouse over says "Was Individual treated in the 
    Emergency Room?" and Was Individual treated at a different facility  
    mouse over says "Was Individual treated in the Emergency Room?"   
 
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------- 
 HD0000000085229
 Problem:  
   If a user clicked the print button from the Complete/Validate/Sign
   Accident Report (2162) an access violation error occurred and a hard
   copy report could not be printed from this option.
 Resolution:
   Modified the Delphi code to prevent this error from occurring.
  
 HD0000000097259
 Problem:
   If the Duty Station or Agency address fields pulled from the 
   INSTITUTION File [#4] contained invalid characters (as defined
   by the Department of Labor {DOL}) the claim was rejected by DOL.
 Resolution:
   Enhanced error checking on these fields to check for invalid
   characters prior to allowing electronic signatures to be 
   applied.
