Description:

 General Overview
 ================
  
 This patch contains enhancements and fixes for the Reminder Reports menu. 
  
 1) Combined report option for multiple facilities  (E3R - 15489)
    
 If more than one facility is selected, a new option allows a combined report 
 to be printed. This is a single report printed for all facilities in which 
 locations/clinics with the same name at different facilities are combined. 
  
 The report also excludes any duplicated patients.
  
 2) Full SSN (E3R - 15490)
  
 On the detailed report, the option to display either long or short SSN is 
 now given.
  
 A new field 'FULL SSN' is created in the CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file
 (#800) and is installed by this patch as value N (for "no"). This is the
 default for the Reminder Due Report. If required, this can be modified to
 Y (for "yes") if long SSN is the norm for a site.
  
 Patients who are employees (based on patient type #391 or patient 
 eligibility #361 in the PATIENT file #2) will display the short SSN even
 if the full SSN display is selected. There is a new parameter in the
 CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file #800 which may be changed to allow the
 employee's full SSN to display. The parameter name is TRUNCATE EMPLOYEE
 SSN and is set to Y(es) at install.
  
 3) Options to total summary reports (E3R - 15489)
    
 This option only applies where a summary report is run for multiple 
 locations, teams or providers. Overall totals may be selected. 
  
 At the end of each facility section, an overall total page is displayed. 
  
 Duplicate entries are removed.
  
 4) Selection of reminder categories or reminders (E3R - 15489)
    
 The prior version of reports allowed selection of individual reminders. 
 This patch allows selection of reminder categories, individual reminders or 
 both. 
  
 All reminders in a category are evaluated and due reminders are reported 
 separately in the same format as individually selected reminders. On the 
 summary report, reminders are sorted in category display sequence with the 
 individual reminders at the end in the order entered.
  
 5) Allow allocation of report templates to individual users (E3R - 15492)
  
 A new menu option PXRM REPORT TEMPLATES (USER) is created to allow 
 templates to be allocated to individual users. A new menu option PXRM 
 REMINDERS DUE (USER) is created which allows a user to produce a reminders 
 due report. The user can only run reports from templates allocated to them 
 in the PXRM REPORT TEMPLATES (USER) and the new option does not allow users 
 to edit or create templates or run reports without a template.
  
 The new options are in the reminder reports submenu:
  
 Select Reminder Managers Menu Option: RP  Reminder Reports
  
    D      Reminders Due Report
    R      Reminders Due Report (User)          [PXRM REMINDERS DUE (USER)]
    U      User Report Templates                [PXRM REPORT TEMPLATES (USER)]
    T      Extract EPI Totals
    L      Extract EPI List by Finding and SSN
    V      Review Date Report   
  
 6) Option to sort inpatient reports by ward/bed        (E3R - 14847)
  
 If a detailed inpatient report is run, the option to sort patients by 
 ward/bed is given. The report also prints a 'Ward/Bed' column instead of 
 'Next Appointment' column. 
  
  
 7) Delimiter separated output format (E3R - 15489)
    
 Condensed reports for import into spreadsheet tables may be created using 
 this option. Headings are suppressed. The option allows a delimiter 
 character to be specified (similar to the Microsoft EXCEL option Data/Get
 External Data/Import Text).
  
  
 8) Report of Review Dates
    
 A new report option PXRM REVIEW DATES is added to the reports menu. This 
 allows review dates up to and including a selected cutoff date to be 
 reported for the reminder package files.
  
 9) Combined reports for multiple locations
  
 This applies to the Detailed report only.
  
 If more than one location is selected, a new option allows a combined report 
 to be printed. Conversely the existing options HA and HAI to print all 
 locations may be printed as separate reports for each location.
