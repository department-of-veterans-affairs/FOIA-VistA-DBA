Subject: INVALID ERROR MESSAGES IN REGISTRATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the invalid error messages that appear during 
 registration.  These messages were introduced from the RA*5.0*38 patch.
  
    Routine RACPTCSV has been changed to prevent display of errors
    for an invalid procedure that has a similar name as the procedure 
    being registered.  Previously, during registration of an exam, if
    the user presses the ENTER key to accept the default procedure,
    if there are other procedures that begin with the same characters
    as the registered procedure, and those procedures are invalid, then
    error messages that pertain to those invalid procedures would be
    displayed even though they were not being registered.
  
    
    This routine has also been changed to display the procedure name
    before the error messages.  Previously, in registration or any of 
    edit exam options, if a user enters part of a procedure name, all
    procedures that begin with that partial entry, if they are invalid,
    would have the specific invalid reasons displayed, but without 
    their procedure names displayed, so the user cannot associate the
    error messages with the procedures.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  The install time for this patch is less than two minutes.  Since there
  are data dictionary changes, this patch should be installed when all 
  Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*46.
   
        When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
        YES//", respond YES.      
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
           RA*
   
     5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*46).
  
     6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
