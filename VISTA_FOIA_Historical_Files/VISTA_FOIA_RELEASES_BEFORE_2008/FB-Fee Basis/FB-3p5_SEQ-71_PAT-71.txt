 OVERVIEW:
 ---------
   MEDICARE RBRVS FEE SCHEDULE DATA FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2004 ADDED
  
     This patch includes the data needed to calculate a fee schedule amount
     based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (RBRVS) for calendar year
     2004.  The RBRVS fee schedule for future calendar years will be issued
     by patch as they become available.
  
     The RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files.
     These files are all stored in global "^FB".  The additional data added
     by this patch will increase the size of the FB global by approximately
     5 MB. The four files are:
    
       FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96)
       FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97)
       FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98)
       FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99)
   
     The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the
     FB global by approximately 5 MB....  If you are journaling ^FB, please 
     insure you have adequate journal space before installing.
 
     Installation of this patch will affect the menu options used to enter
     or edit payments for the Medical Fee program (outpatient) and
     ancillary payments for the Civil Hospital program.  The calendar year
     2004 RBRVS fee schedule will be used for payments that have a date of
     service on or after March 1, 2004.  The RBRVS fee schedules for
     calendar years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 will be retained in the
     computer and will continue to be used for payments that have a date of
     service on or after September 1, 1999 but before March 1, 2004.
               
     The computer would have used the 2003 RBRVS fee schedule for any
     payments entered prior to the installation of this patch that had a
     date of service on or after March 1, 2004.  Existing payments are
     NOT modified by this patch.  The fee schedule amount is only
     calculated when payments are entered or edited.
  
     The PLACE OF SERVICE code is used to determine if the facility or 
     non-facility practice expense RVU should be used during RBRVS fee 
     schedule calculations.  The list of codes considered facility and 
     non-facility has been updated by this patch to conform with Medicare 
     practices.
  
     Prior to this patch:
      Codes considered as facility setting -
        21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 31, 34, 41, 42, 51, 52, 53, 56, 61, 99
      Codes considered as non-facility setting -
        03, 04, 11, 12, 15, 20, 25, 32, 33, 50, 54, 55, 60, 62, 65, 71, 
        72, 81
  
     After this patch is installed:
      Codes considered as facility setting -
        21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 31, 34, 41, 42, 51, 52, 53, 56, 61
      Codes considered as non-facility setting -
        03,04,11,12,13,14,15,20,25,32,33,49,50,54,55,57,60,62,65,71,
        72,81,99
  
     The following five options are used to enter or edit payments for the
     Medical Fee (outpatient) program.
  
       Enter Payment                       [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
       Multiple Payment Entry              [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
       C&P/Multiple Patient Payment Entry  [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
       Reimbursement Payment Entry         [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
       Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
  
     The following four options are used to enter or edit ancillary
     payments for the Civil Hospital program.
  
       Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment  [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Multiple Ancillary Payments          [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
       Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary  [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
        Services
       Edit Ancillary Payment               [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
     The following option is used to calculate a fee schedule amount
     without having to enter a payment.
  
       Calculate Payment Amount             [FBAA FEE SCHEDULE RATE]
