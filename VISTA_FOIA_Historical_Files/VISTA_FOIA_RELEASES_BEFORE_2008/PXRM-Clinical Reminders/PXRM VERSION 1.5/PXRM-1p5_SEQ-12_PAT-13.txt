Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch releases three new NATIONAL reminders and dialogs required for the
 Hypertension project.  They will be placed in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file 
 (#811.8).
                 VA-HTN ASSESSMENT BP >=140/90
                 VA-HTN ASSESSMENT BP >=160/100
                 VA-HTN LIFESTYLE EDUCATION
 
 Reminder Exchange will automatically install these reminders/dialog and 
 their components. Reminder Exchange will automatically overwrite any 
 identical components.
 
 The Hypertension Clinical Reminders Project and the Office of Information (OI)
 System Design & Development (SDD) Health Data Systems group have developed the
 Hypertension clinical reminders and dialogs released in this patch. These 
 reminders have been approved by the National Clinical Practice Guideline
 Council for distribution. The reminders contain provider interventions for 
 Blood Pressure management of patients with a known diagnosis of Hypertension 
 (HTN).  
  
 The goal of the National Hypertension Clinical Reminders Project is to develop
 and nationally distribute clinical reminders that can be used by providers to
 facilitate Blood Pressure management of patients with a diagnosis of
 Hypertension (HTN) and can help increase adherence to national clinical
 practice guidelines.
  
 PXRMP13I will run as a pre-install routine to convert V-HTN reminders to
 VA-HTN reminders. If any V-HTN reminders have been renamed locally they 
 will not be converted unless the original name is restored prior to 
 installing this patch.
 
 Documentation for the Hypertension guideline can be found at: 
 http://www.oqp.med.va.gov/cpg/HTN/HTN_base.htm
 
 This patch will also release fixes to routine PXRMOPT and PXRMLFNF that will
 fix a problem displaying TIU Objects that contain Clinical Maintenance data in
 the GUI. This problem was discovered while testing TIU*1.0*135.
 
 The pre-install routine PXRMP13I will be deleted once the installation has 
 completed.
