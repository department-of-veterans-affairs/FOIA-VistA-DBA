Subject: MODIFICATION FOR PFSS CAPTURE OF HEC ORU MSG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented 
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2.0*260, is set to "ON".  The 
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at 
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 (IB) patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/billreplace/
  
  
  
 VistA Registration will remain the authoritative source for patient 
 registration.  This patch updates a link between Income Verification Match
 (IVM) and PFSS to handle inbound HL7 (ORU) batch messages.  These messages
 update a variety of patient demographic data inbound from the Health
 Eligibility Center (HEC).  It will be necessary to "capture" these updates
 as they are processed into VistA legacy and forward the information to the
 PFSS application. This patch updates an earlier single-message link to
 process batch messages and initiate the generation of A31 Update Person
 messages.

 NOTE: To avoid release dependencies you may see "F - Reference to routine
 '^DGPFSS2'. That isn't in this UCI." when running XINDEX.  This error
 message will not cause any problems as the software checks for the
 existence of the routine prior to trying to call it.
