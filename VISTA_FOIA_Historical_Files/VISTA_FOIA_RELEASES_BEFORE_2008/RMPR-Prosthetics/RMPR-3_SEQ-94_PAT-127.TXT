Subject: NATIONAL PIP ROLLUP DISCREPANCIES/COMPILE DEFECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. The National PIP roll-up does not match the VISTA Item Detail report
    for on hand stock quantity and cost.  Also, both reporting methods
    used the current running balance on file regardless of the end date
    in the reporting period specified.
  
 2. Fix the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for station number's starting point
    in Prosthetics Inventory Package (PIP) Extract collection to begin at
    station 1 instead of 2.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD134413   PIP roll-up does not match local VISTA report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The National PIP roll-up does not match the VISTA Item Detail report
 for on hand stock quantity and cost.  Also, both reporting methods
 used the current running balance on file regardless of the end date
 in the reporting period specified.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will modify RMPR5HQ5 and RMPRPIQ5 to use the correct 
 on hand running balance transaction in file 661.9 in the Extract
 process.  Also, both reporting methods will now use the specified
 end date requested to pull the running balance as of that date.
  
 Although this patch will reduce significantly the dollar amount 
 differences between the NATIONAL PIP ROLLUP and the ITEM DETAIL REPORT it 
 will not eliminate them. The following circumstance will continue to 
 result in slight dollar differences between the reports.
   
   1.  Running either report after the end date requested WILL include any 
 returns made after that same end date, since the transaction date used for
 returns is the original issue date, which may be prior to the end 
 date requested.
  
 2. HD112266      PIP info not transmitted
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem deals with an IEN of 1 and the PIP Extract process begins
 at IEN 2.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will modify RMPR5HQ5 to begin with station 1 for PIP
 Extract process.
