 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 --------------------------------------------------- 
 ANN-0901-42114       <NULLSUBSCR>KIT2+6~PRCPCRPL:1
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------
 ANN-0901-42114       <NULLSUBSCR>KIT2+6~PRCPCRPL:1
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 A null subscript error is encountered when printing a picking ticket for 
 an INSTRUMENT KIT ITEM, field (#.01) from the INSTRUMENT KITS file
 (#445.8) if:  1) the item is contained in a case cart and 2) the PRINT
 SEQUENCE field (#2) in the ITEMS SUB-FIELD (#445.81) is null.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Add code that will eliminate the null subscript error by not requiring 
 the field PRINT SEQUENCE to be defined.
