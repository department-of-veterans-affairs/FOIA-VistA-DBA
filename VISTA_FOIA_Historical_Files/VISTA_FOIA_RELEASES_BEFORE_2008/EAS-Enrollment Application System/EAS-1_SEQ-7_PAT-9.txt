Subject: USE DATE OF 1010EZ FOR INCOME YEAR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  Patch EAS*1*9 distributes modifications to two routines in order to 
  resolve NOIS TNV-0102-31847.
   
  The NOIS report describes a problem when a 1010EZ that contains income-
  related data for Income Year 2000 is being filed to the site's database
  after January 1, 2002. Under these circumstances, data is being filed
  into the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME file (#408.21) as Income Year 2001.
  (Filing is done using the "File 1010EZ" action on the "10-10EZ Processing"
  List Manager screen.)
   
  Subroutines I408^EASEZI and F408^EASEZF2 have been corrected to calculate
  the income year appropriately.  Income year will now be based upon the 
  date on which the 1010EZ submission was received at the site, rather than
  upon the date when filing is being performed.
