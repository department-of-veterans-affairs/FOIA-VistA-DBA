Subject: OUTPATIENT PHARMACY VDEF MESSAGE ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch adds the NCPDP (National Council for Prescription Drug 
 Programs) number from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) to the Outpatient
 Pharmacy VDEF (Vista Data Extraction Framework) message that sends
 prescription information to the HDR (Health Data Repository). VistA must
 collect and maintain this information and make this number readily 
 available for application interfaces to store and forward to meet 
 requirements for the CHDR (Clinical Data Repository / Health Data
 Repository) project to provide this number to the DoD (Department of
 Defense). This is a required field in the DoD PDTS (Pharmacy Data
 Transaction Service) application.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
 Because this patch modifies routines involved in the exchange of messages
 between Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Outpatient Pharmacy,
 this patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy users
 on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not being
 acted upon through CPRS. There are also three tasked jobs that generate
 message exchanges between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy, and this patch
 should be installed at a time when these jobs are not running. These jobs
 are PSO AUTOCANCEL, PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS, and ORMTIME RUN.
 Installation of this patch should take no longer than 3 minutes.
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*220) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*220.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
  from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
  
  FILE NAME               DESCRIPTION
  PSO_7_P220_TM_CP.PDF    Outpatient Pharmacy Technical Manual Change Pages
  
  NOTE: Only a Change Pages document will be distributed with this patch 
  due to the number of other Outpatient Pharmacy patches being released in
  a very short timeframe. A full technical manual will be released in patch
  PSO*7*213.
  
  (3) Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA
  Documentation Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
  http://www.va.gov/vdl
