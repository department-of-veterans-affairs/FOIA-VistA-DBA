Subject: EMPLOYEE ADDRESS AND OTHER ISSUES

Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses numerous NOIS messages, as described below. Issues 
 included involve data entry of the Employee address fields in the 2162 and 
 CA1/CA2, data integrity issues with the DATE/TIME OF OCCURRENCE field (#4)
 of the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260) and being able to edit the 
 Supervisor/Secondary Supervisor fields in the 2162, the Print Report of
 Accident option printing all cases instead of only open cases, and not being 
 able to open cases for employees that are not in the Employee Master 
 (#450) file.  Additionally, the following prompts have been removed from 
 the Create Accident/Illness Record option:  Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, 
 Other, Date Ordered, Date Drawn, and Follow-up Date.
  
 Overview of NOIS messages:
 --------------------------
  
 1. ALB-0199-51743    Not entering address on 2162, address not printed on 
                      CA1/CA2
 Problem:
 --------
 There are two sets of address fields stored in the package.  The address 
 entered on the 2162 and the one entered on the CA1/CA2.  The address used 
 for printing on the CA1/CA2 is pulled from the address entered on the 2162. 
 If an address is not entered on the 2162, then no address is printed on 
 the form.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 One set of address fields will now be used.  The address fields for the 
 2162, CA1 or CA2 are stored in one place.  All forms now use the 
 Address fields from the 2162 from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file 
 (#2260).  Editing the address field on any form will be reflected on all
 forms.
  
  
 2.  STC-1198-40331    Cannot edit Supervisor's fields on 2162
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reports that the Supervisor originally entered on the 2162 cannot be 
 edited. The ability to edit that field is necessary given that the 
 supervisor may leave prior to the case being closed. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made so that the SUPERVISOR and SECONDARY SUPERVISOR
 fields (file 2260, fields #53 and #53.1) on the 2162 can be edited using the 
 Edit Report of Incident option [OOPS SUP ENTRY] or [OOPS SAFETY SUP ENTRY].
  
 3.  HVH-0299-11678    Supervisor could sign off the CA1 before the 
                       employee
 Problem:
 --------
 If the supervisor uses the option Validate and Sign CA1, CA2 or 2162 
 [OOPS SUP VALIDATE] and chooses CA1, a signature code can be entered.  Then 
 the supervisor can use this same option to validate and sign the 2162 by
 entering the signature code.  After this has been done, the employee cannot 
 edit the CA-1.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Programming changes have been made to prevent the Supervisor from using the 
 Validate and Sign CA1, CA2, or 2162 [OOPS SUP VALIDATE] option to sign the
 CA1 prior to the employee, regardless of the order in which the Supervisor 
 attempts to sign the forms.
   
   
 4. FGH-0299-32334     Cannot enter Non-'PAID' employees as employees
 Problem:
 --------
 Employees that are not in the PAID file (#450) cannot be entered as 
 employees in the system.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A new category has been added to the PERSONNEL STATUS field of the ASISTS 
 ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260, field #2).  This category, Non-PAID 
 Employee will allow the entry of employees not in the PAID file.  Error 
 checking for these employees will be against the New Person file (#200).  
 Therefore, if the individual is not in the New Person file, the Non-PAID 
 Employee category cannot be used.
  
  
 5. NAS-0299-31148    Print Report of Accident prints all cases, not open 
                      cases
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Print Report of Accident [OOPS SUP PRINT] option, all cases 
 print.  The report should list only the cases which are currently open.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Print Report of Accident [OOPS SUP PRINT] option has been modified so 
 that only open cases are included on the report.
  
  
 6. ALB-0299-51566    Time of Occurrence is lost when DATE/TIME OF 
                      OCCURRENCE is edited on the CA1 by a Supervisor 
 Problem:
 --------
 The DATE/TIME OF OCCURRENCE field on the CA1 does not require that Time be 
 entered.  Therefore, when that field is edited by a Supervisor the Time is 
 removed from the 2162 if the Supervisor only enters a date.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes have been made to require both the Date and Time for the DATE/TIME 
 INJURY OCCURRED field (#109) of the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260) 
 in the CA1.  The field will continue to default from the 2162.
  
  
 7.  No NOIS    Removal of prompts from the Create 
                Accident/Illness Record
 Problem:
 --------
 It was determined by the ASISTS TAG that information in the following 
 prompts are being inappropriately collected in the Create Accident/Illness 
 Record [OOPS CREATE CASE] Option:  Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, Other, 
 Date Ordered, Date Drawn, and Follow-up Date.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The above mentioned prompts have been removed from the option as well as the 
 Print Report of Accident [OOPS SUP PRINT] option.
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
 ASISTS Employee Health Menu        OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU
