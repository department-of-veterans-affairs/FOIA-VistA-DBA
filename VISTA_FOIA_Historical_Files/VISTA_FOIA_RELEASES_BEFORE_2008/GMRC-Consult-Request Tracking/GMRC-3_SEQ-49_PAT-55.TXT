 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD151414 - consult update alert not flying
  
    Problem (1):
    ------------
    Currently, when a non-consult team member schedules or comments on a
    consult, the Consult/Request Update alerts are not being sent to the
    consult team members when the consult service is setup in the REQUEST
    SERVICES (#123.5) file with the UNRESTRICTED ACCESS (#.06) field set
    to "YES".  Only the provider is receiving an update alert when a
    non-consult team user who is not the provider enters a comment or 
    orders a consult.
  
    Resolution (1):
    ---------------
    Consult/Request Update alerts will be sent to the Consult team when a
    comment is made (or consult scheduled) by a user who is not on the
    Consult team, even if the UNRESTRICTED ACCESS (#.06) field is set to
    "YES".
  
  
    Problem (2):
    ------------
    It was also determined that Consult/Request Update alerts were
    sometimes sent back to the user taking the action.  A user should
    not receive an alert for an action they performed.
  
    Resolution (2):
    ---------------
    Consult/Request Update alerts will no longer be sent to the user
    taking the action.  If a user wishes to  get an alert, he can add
    himself as an additional recipient of the alert.
  
  
    Problem(3):
    -----------
    When a user enters a comment on a consult via the CPRS GUI, alerts are
    being sent (as they should) despite the message displayed, "No 
    automatic alerts will be sent".
  
    Resolution (3):
    ---------------
    There are 2 parts to the solution for this; The first is the coding 
    change being made in this patch.  The second is a change included in
    CPRS GUI v27.  The coding change is being made here will be 
    transparent to the user until the release of CPRS GUI v27.
