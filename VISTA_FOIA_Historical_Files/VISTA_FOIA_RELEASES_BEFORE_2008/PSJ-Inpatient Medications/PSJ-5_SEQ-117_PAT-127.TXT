Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*110   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*127'

  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  * WARNING - Prior to installing this patch, please check for local Class
  III modifications that may be overwritten upon installation. Failure to
  reinstall Class III modifications after installation of this patch may
  prevent the Class III changes from functioning properly.
  
  1. A site reports that when a nurse verifies a renewed order, the nurse's
  initials do not consistently appear in Bar Code Medication Administration
  (BCMA) V.3.0. This patch corrects the problem by saving the verifying
  nurse information if the nurse verification occurred after the renewal
  action. NCH-1004-40487.
  
  2. A site reports that IV orders copied using the CO (Copy) action in
  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 retain the original order's verifying
  pharmacist, so that an unverified copied IV order may incorrectly appear
  to have been verified by a pharmacist. This patch corrects the problem
  by removing the original order's verifying pharmacist from the copied
  order. CLA-1004-22199.
  
  3. A site reports that after discontinuing a complex IV order, a user
  may be prevented from creating a new IV order until first exiting and
  then returning to the option. The software treats the new IV order like
  a complex order and prevents entry of some required fields. This patch
  corrects the problem by improving the check that determines whether or
  not the current order is a complex order. SAG-1004-41795.
  
  4. When using the SF (Speed Finish) action to finish pending renewal
  orders in the Unit Dose Order Entry [PSJU NE] option, the name of the
  finishing pharmacist is incorrectly saved as the provider for the order.
  This patch corrects this problem by properly saving the ordering provider
  with the order when SF (Speed Finish) is used. AMA-1004-71742.
  
  5. When a component, or child order, of a complex order is created from
  Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 with a schedule of NOW
  and NOW does not exist in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1),
  the order does not appear in the patient's profile in Inpatient
  Medications V. 5.0. This patch corrects the problem by ensuring child
  orders with a schedule of NOW appear in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.
  MEM-1004-71977.
  
  6. Renewed Unit Dose orders do not appear on the updated pick list
  printed using the Update Pick List [PSJU PLUP] option. With this patch
  renewed orders will appear on the updated pick list when appropriate.
  NCH-1104-40147.
  
  7. When finishing a complex order that was renewed from CPRS, there is a
  prompt for Pre-Exchange Doses, but there is no prompt to print the
  Pre-Exchange Report. A prompt has been added to allow the Pre-Exchange
  report to be printed for renewed complex orders. MAR-1004-21942.
  
  8. The SF Speed Finish action in the Unit Dose Order Entry [PSJU NE]
  option prompts for Pre-Exchange Doses, but there is no prompt to print
  the Pre-Exchange Report when finishing a pending renewal order. A prompt
  has been added to allow the Pre-Exchange Report to be printed for orders
  that are finished using the SF Speed Finish action. CLE-1004-42151.
  
  9. The initial label printed for renewed continuous IV orders indicates 
  it is due at the date and time that the order was renewed, rather than 
  at the next scheduled infusion date and time. With this patch, the first 
  label printed for this type of order will be due at the next scheduled 
  infusion date and time. IND-1104-40485.
  
  10. After finishing IV scripts, the user is prompted for the number of
  labels to print.  The label print code does not limit the user input, so
  if the user enters an excessive number of labels, then this can lead to
  system performance problems.  This patch will apply the limit of 99
  labels at the number of labels prompt. SFC-0603-61734.
  
  11. Complex Orders are not showing on the VDL in BCMA V.3.0 when the
  order initially contains a schedule without a frequency, regardless of
  edits made during finishing. With this patch, the schedule changes made
  during finish will update the complex orders schedule frequency, enabling
  the orders to display in BCMA V.3.0 at the appropriate times.
  SBY-1104-31772.
  
  12. The stop date of a pending renewal order containing a non-standard
  schedule and an orderable item with a day/dose limit cannot be edited 
  until after the order is made active. Also, Schedule Type and Unit 
  Per Dose edits made during finish of a pending renewal are not applied
  when the order is made active. With this patch, changes made to these 
  fields during the finish process will be applied to the active order.
  ERI-1204-20679
  
  13. One-time orders that are not part of a complex order may be renewed 
  from CPRS V.1.0, even after they are given. This patch will prevent this
  problem by preventing all non-complex one-time orders from being renewed.
  Restriction of the renewal of complex one-time orders will be addressed
  in a future CPRS V.1.0 patch. PSI-04-056.
                                                                  
  14. This patch modifies the Data Dictionary of the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS 
  file (#53.1) for the ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER field (#125). The change 
  removes Inpatient Medications from the process of stripping NOW orders 
  from Complex Orders. This process is handled exclusively by CPRS V.1.0.
  
  53.1,125     ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER .2;8 POINTER TO ORDER FILE (#100)
  
               LAST EDITED:     DEC 13, 2004
               HELP-PROMPT:     Enter the parent order, if this order is 
                                its child order.
               DESCRIPTION:     This is the parent of a CPRS order that 
                                may have a parent/child relationship in
                                CPRS.
  
              CROSS-REFERENCE:  53.1^ACX
                                1)= S ^PS(53.1,"ACX",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""
                                2)= K ^PS(53.1,"ACX",$E(X,1,30),DA)
                                This cross reference is created each time a
                                component of a complex order, or child 
                                order, is received from CPRS.  This cross
                                reference will not be created for orders
                                with a schedule of NOW, effectively
                                disassociating the NOW order from the other
                                child orders in the complex order.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  * WARNING - Prior to installing this patch, please check for local Class
  III modifications that may be overwritten upon installation. Failure to
  reinstall Class III modifications after installation of this patch may
  prevent the Class III modifications for Omnicell, Pyxis and McKesson,
  among others.
  
  This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 1 minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.

     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSJ*5.0*127):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSJ*5.0*127.
