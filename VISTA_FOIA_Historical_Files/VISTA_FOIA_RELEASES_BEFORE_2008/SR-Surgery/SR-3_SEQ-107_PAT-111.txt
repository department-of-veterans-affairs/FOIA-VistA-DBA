 Document Retrieval Instructions:
 ================================
 Sites will retrieve VistA documentation in one of the following ways:
   
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
       download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
       first available FTP server.
   
   
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
       specific server as follows:
       OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
   
       Albany            ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
       Hines             ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
       Salt Lake City    ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       anonymous.software
   
   
   The documentation distribution includes:
 
       FILE NAMES                          DESCRIPTION
 
       SR_3_0_P111_TM_CP.pdf	    Technical Manual change pages
       SR_3_0_TM_R1202.pdf	    Technical Manual
       SR_3_0_P111_UM_CP.pdf         User Manual change pages

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
     This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
     take less than 1 minute. Installation should not take place while the
     options are being executed.
  
     1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
          be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
          routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
          mapped set.
  
     3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
          the Installation menu.
  
     4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
          (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*111)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).	
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*111.
  
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
        respond NO.
  
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
