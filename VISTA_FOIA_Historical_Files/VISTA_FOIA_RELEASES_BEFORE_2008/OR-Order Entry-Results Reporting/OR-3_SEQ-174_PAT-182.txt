Associated patches: (v)OR*3*173    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*182'

Subject: Identify allergy order problems

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 Under certain circumstances, allergy data may not be properly sent to the
 allergy package, which may cause missed allergy related order checks on
 subsequent orders.
  
 The problem was identified and fixed in patch OR*3*173 (GUI v22).
  
 This patch consists of one single routine, ORY182.  This patch
 will identify allergy orders that were entered but were not passed
 to the allergy package.  In addition, this patch will identify any entry
 in the ORDER (#100) file that is missing its zero node.
  
 Upon installation of this patch, routine ORY182 will be queued to
 run in the background.  Upon completion, a mail message will be
 sent to previously identified individuals listing all patients who
 had allergy orders that were not correctly sent to the allergy package. 
 Also included in this message will be the internal entry numbers of 
 entries without a zero node.
  
 Upon receipt of this list, designated individuals will need to review
 the patient's chart to be sure that allergy information is correct
 and current for the specified patient.  If your listing contains ORDER 
 file entries without a zero node then these extraneous entries will need 
 to be cleaned up.  Clean up can be done by the local IRM staff or a NOIS
 can be logged for assistance.
  
 Upon receipt of the mail message, routine ORY182 can be deleted.

 SBY-0901-30661     ERROR - <UNDEF>ALG+6_ORMBLDAL
  
 The error in ORMBLDAL would be reported when CPRS attempted to send the 
 allergy order to the allergy file.  However, the actual allergy was never 
 stored in the allergy package.  The order did appear on the CPRS orders 
 view though, so it wasn't obvious that there was a problem.

 of this patch then recipients for the report will not be prompted for and
