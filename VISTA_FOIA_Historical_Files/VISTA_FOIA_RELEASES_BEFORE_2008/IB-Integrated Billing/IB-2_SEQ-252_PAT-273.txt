Description:
============

 ******************************** N O T E ***********************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS implementation. 
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any problems.
 ****************************************************************************
  
 The outdated $NEXT function in the M code for several Trigger style 
 cross-references in certain Integrated Billing files has been replaced to 
 bring code up to standard. No application functionality has been changed.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
   
 1. ISP-0104-N2075     XINDEX finding of $N 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When Integrated Billing patch IB*2.0*215 was released, several cautious
    installers noted that XINDEX reported a problem with the Data Dictionary
    change because some of the code contained the obsolete $N function.  
    The code has been around a long time and was generated by an earlier
    version of FileMan.  Current M platforms within the VHA are still
    compatible with this old function but it could cause a problem at some
    point in the future.  It was decided to go ahead with the release and
    installation of IB*2.0*215 and to update the Data Dictionary in a
    separate patch.  This is the patch.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    FileMan v22 generates code with the $ORDER function rather than the
    obsolete $NEXT function.  In order to update the outdated code in the
    Data Dictionary, several Trigger type cross-references have to be
    recompiled and redistributed.  The appropriate fields have been
    updated in the Integrated Billing development account and packaged
    for re-distribution in this patch.  You should see no change in behavior
    in any Integrated Billing functionality.  For a list of the fields that
    are involved, see the Technical section below.

    Five Input Templates which contain one or more of the above fields are
    recompiled by the post install routine IB20P273.  Those templates are:
    IB CURRENT STATUS
    IB STATUS
    IB SCREEN3
    IB SCREEN6
    IB SCREEN7
   
    A new CREATE CONDITION has been added to cross reference number 4 for
    field BILL NUMBER (#.01) in file BILL/CLAIMS (#399).  This condition
    ensures that the triggered field is not overwritten if it already 
    contains data.  The condition code is:  INTERNAL(#2)=""
