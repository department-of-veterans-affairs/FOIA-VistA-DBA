Subject: TWO LEADING ZERO ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  1. PHO-0803-61519:  
     If finishing an order as a syringe and the volume is
     less than 1ml, when entering the decimal it will not allow a leading
     zero(0).  
     RESOLUTION:
       The correction for this problem will allow the input of a
       leading zero(0).  If the user does not enter a leading zero(0), the
       software will add it.
  
  2. HEH-1004-40163:  
     When pharmacy prints a label for a TPN order mix, the
     leading zero(0) in 0.5 GM of magnesium sulfate does not print.  
     RESOLUTION:
       The correction for this problem will add the leading zero(0) to the 
       strength calculation if the value is less than zero(0).  A change
       has also been made during the entry process of strength to add a
       leading zero(0) if the user does not.
  
 Associated NOISs:
 =================
  PHO-0803-61519   VOLUME IN IV SYRINGE DOESN'T ALLOW LEADING 0
