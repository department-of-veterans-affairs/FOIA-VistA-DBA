Subject: INCORRECT DOMAIN NAMES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the domain names in the Pharmacy Prescription Practice
 (PPP) files. The files are: 
  
 PPP DOMAIN XREF (#1020.8) & PPP CONVERSION SITE (#1020.128)
  
 The conversion of the domain names is performed by a pre-install routine
 that runs automatically when the patch is installed. The routine will
 remain on the system for possible use in future patches.

  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PPP*1.0*37).

       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
