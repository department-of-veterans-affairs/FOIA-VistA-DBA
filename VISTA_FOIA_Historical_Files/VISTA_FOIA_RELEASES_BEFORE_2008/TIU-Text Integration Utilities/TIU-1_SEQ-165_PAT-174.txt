Subject: TIU Blank Note Text Report

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains a routine used for the reporting of TIU Documents that do 
 not have any report text, are missing the 0 node of the text node, or both 
 cases.  The report results have the following categories:
    Missing Text Only   - means the note has a 0 TEXT node, but no text
      (and this can be fine depending on the status of the document, such
      as undictated) 
    Missing 0 Node Only  - means the note has text but no 0
      TEXT node 
    Missing 0 node & Text - means the note doesn't have a 0 TEXT
      node or text

 =========================
 This report can be run using the new menu option, Missing Text Report, on 
 the MIS Manager's Menu [TIU MAIN MENU MGR], or directly from the programmer 
 prompt by entering D REPORT^TIUPS174.
  
 This routine should not be deleted after it is initially used.
  
 The report can be run as often as needed to track the occurrences 
 of documents without text and missing the 0 text node.  It is advised to run 
 the report on a regular interval (once per week or month) to track an 
 increase or decrease of reported documents missing text or the 0 text node.
 Suggestions for use and cleanup are as follows:
  
 1.  From the MIS Manager's Menu [TIU MAIN MENU MGR], select option # 7,
     Missing Text Report.  After the initial report, it is advised to run
     this report daily to review all newly created documents.
  
 Cleanup recommendations are as follows:
  
   - NO TEXT in DOCUMENT body with no attached addendum or image, document 
     may or may not have the "TEXT" 0 node as indicated by the report.  
     Delete or retract the document (based upon status); no disclaimer is
     needed.
  
   - If the "TEXT" 0 node is missing as indicated by the report and the 
     document has text:
      - For direct entry documents, contact author to make an addendum to
        the note and add the missing information.  Sites may determine
        the allowable timeframe to permit the author entering the addendum
        with the missing information.  If the author is no longer at the 
        site or the timeframe has passed, the HIMS Manager or designee
        should enter an addendum with the following disclaimer:
        
        "DISCLAIMER: This completed document contains missing text that 
        was electronically deleted in error"
  
      - For uploaded documents, contact the transcription company to 
        re-upload if possible or contact the author to make an addendum to 
        the note and add the missing information.
  
 An informational alert will be sent once the report process has finished. 
  
 The search criteria is as follows:
     Document may be of any type, including ADDENDUM
     Document must fall within user entered date range
     Document missing the 0 text node, text, or both
     Document must NOT have any addenda ("DAD" cross-reference)
