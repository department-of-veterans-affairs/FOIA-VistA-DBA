Description: 
============

 Developed in MNT,VBB
 
 This patch is one of three comprising the VistA side modifications 
 necessary to implement the Means Test Signature functionality.  The patch 
 contains two new reporting routines; one to provide a summary of means test 
 signature compliance by income year, the other to provide detailed 
 information on each non-compliant means test (veteran name and SSN, etc.).  
 Also included in this patch are new menu (Means Test Signature Reports) and 
 sub-menu (Means Test Signature Summary Report, Means Test Detail Report) 
 options added to the existing MEANS TEST SUPERVISOR menu.  The new options 
 will provide user level access to these reports.   Finally, a new field,
 MT SIGNED? (#.29) is created in the DG MEANS TEST (#408.31) file to hold
 the Means Test Signature indicator.
 
 A new mail group (EAS MEANS TEST SIGNATURE) is created by this patch.  The 
 new group will receive messages from HEC regarding veterans' means test 
 signature status.  Please contact the appropriate person at your site to 
 determine members and Coordinator for this mail group.
 
 Each VA Medical Center must also establish a local mail group within VA's 
 Global Address List of Microsoft Exchange to be used for e-mail 
 communication between HEC, the vendor and VA facilities.  This mail group 
 must be populated with individuals who will oversee and act as local points 
 of contact (POC) for the means test transmissions to HEC/vendor.  
 Responsible employees were previously identified to HEC in October 2001. 
 However, sites may include other staff involved in the signed means test 
 project within their local mail group.  Mail group members should be 
 familiar with means testing and will serve as liaisons for administrative 
 and technical needs for their facilities.  Each facility's Exchange 
 Administrator is required to establish this mail group with a local/VISN 
 naming convention by December 7, 2001, using the following format for the 
 SMTP:
 
   3-digit facility number+MT+up to 4-digit facility abbreviation@med.va.gov
 
 For example for Washington DC:  688mtwash@med.va.gov
 
 Once this e-mail group is established, the "owner" or the facility's 
 Exchange Administrator must send a confirmation e-mail to 
 HECMTIndex@med.va.gov.

 Companion patch IVM*2.0*44 contains modified versions of existing IVM* 
 namespaced routines that will facilitate parsing the new HL7 transmitted 
 signature validity field.
 
 The final Means Test Signature patch, DG*5.3*420, contains versions of 
 existing DG* namespaced routines that control the Patient Inquiry and View 
 a Past Means Test menu options.  These options have been modified to 
 include reporting of Means Test Signature data.
