          to the following question: "Do you want to SEARCH for entries
          to be exported?"
  
      3b. Use the following field for the search: $E(CMR,1,2)

          The file name will consist of 3 parts. They are "station number",
          the text "AEMSMERS", and the date.
          
           a. Station number => 442
