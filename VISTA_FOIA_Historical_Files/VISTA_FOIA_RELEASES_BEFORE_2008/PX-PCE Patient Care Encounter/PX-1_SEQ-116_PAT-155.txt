Subject: FIX IO VARIABLES IN PCE REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 There is a problem with certain PCE reports when printing from a 
 Cache'/VMS system. When the report is queued, the IO variables are 
 incorrect. This causes the printer's escape sequence to print on the 
 report. It also causes and tab characters to return to the beginning of 
 the current line. This patch will fix this printing issue.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 CTX-0804-70413
 
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 When a site converts to Cache' on VMS there is a problem with certain PCE 
 reports. The printer is printing 'escape codes' on the report. Also, any 
 tabs within the report cause the printer to go back to the beginning of 
 the current line. This causes the existing text to be overwritten.
 
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 These reports utilize a queueing program that tasks both the sort and the 
 print portions of the process. This queueing program calls HOME^%ZIS to 
 reset the IO variables to the screen. This is correct after the report 
 prints. However, since the same code is being used for the sort, this call 
 needs to only happen when it is being called to do the print portion. 
 This patch will make this change.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still display the patch text
    only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter PX*1.0*155)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*155.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
         PCE Encounter Summary           [PXRR PCE ENCOUNTER SUMMARY]
         PCE Clinical Reports            [PXRR CLINICAL REPORTS]
         Provider Encounter Counts       [PXRR PROVIDER ENCOUNTER COUNTS]
         Location Encounter Counts       [PXRR LOCATION ENCOUNTER COUNTS]
         Patient Activity by Location    [PXRR PATIENT ACTIVITY BY LOC]
         Diagnosis Ranked by Frequency   [PXRR MOST FREQUENT DIAGNOSES]
  
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
