Subject: State Data Extract

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch will enhance the Oncology 2.11 package to support the Commission
 on Cancer's 1996 State Data extract.
                 
 The following modifications have been made:
       
 1) The extract software has been modified to include all of the required
    fields for state reporting.
      
 2) A new option, "Create a report to preview State output" [ONCO #STATE DATA
    REPORT], has been added to the "Utility Options" [ONCO UTIL MENU] menu.
      
 3) Transfer of the state data to disk has been improved:  
    a) The on-line help instructions have been modified to reflect the new
       data capture process.  
    b) The state data will no longer need to be run through the QBASIC
       conversion routine.  
    c) Both version 5 and 5.1 of the North American Association of Central
       Cancer Registries (NAACCR) record layout are supported by
       this patch.
       
 4) This patch fixes a problem with the computed field FIRST COURSE DATE
    (165.5,49).  If all treatment dates were either 00/00/00 or 99/99/99,
    FIRST COURSE DATE would compute to 00/00/00.  It will now compute to
    99/99/99.
  
 This patch will also resolve the following NOIS calls:
  
   HAM-0996-20718  State Data Disk incomplete,^VIC(5.1 missing)
   MAD-1296-40434  STATE DATA DISK: PROBLEMS ID'D BY STATE
   NTH-0597-71829  STATE DATA INFORMATION
   HOU-0797-71631  State Oncology Registry needing county codes
