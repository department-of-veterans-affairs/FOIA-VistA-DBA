Description: 
============

 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  
      * Since this patch incorporates many changes, as well as enhancements 
        to the ASISTS package, it is STRONGLY recommended that all open 
        claims signed by the Employee prior to the installation of this 
        patch be completed by submitting the hardcopy claim to the 
        Department of Labor.  Electronic submission of these claims is not
        recommended due to the new requirements in this patch.
  
      * OOPS*1.0*10 must be installed immediately after installation of this
        patch.  This is due to specification changes to functionality
        introduced in this patch that have dependencies with patch 10. 
  
      * Patch XM*DBA*136 must be installed prior to installation of this
        patch. It sets up the queue necessary for transmitting ASISTS 
        CA1/CA2 Claim data to the AAC.
  
   
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message:
 ------------------------------------------------
  
 FAV-1000-72753
  
 In the option, Validate and Sign CA1,CA2 or 2162 [OOPS SUP VALIDATE], 
 mail bulletins to the Supervisor and Union were not being sent when the 
 Supervisor signed the claim.  After this patch is installed, bulletins will 
 be sent to the Supervisor and Union.
   
 This patch addresses the following E3Rs:
 ----------------------------------------
  
 11570, 11994, 12129, 12156, 12162, 12226, 12373, 12765
  
   
 In addition, patch OOPS*1*8 includes enhancements to ASISTS to enable the
 electronic submission and transmission of CA1/CA2 claims to the Department
 of Labor (DOL) through the Austin Automation Center (AAC).  Functionality
 is incorporated in this patch for Worker's Compensation personnel to
 complete the portions of the claim they are responsible for and provide
 support to the Supervisor as necessary.  This patch has modifications
 necessary to support the collection of data elements needed for the
 electronic submission of claims.
  
 Once the patch is released the "ASISTS User Manual" will be available at:
  
   http://vista.med.va.gov/fms/asists/index.html
  
  
 Modifications contained in the patch are described below.
  
  
 The PAY RATE PER Field (#167) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
 File (#2260) has been changed from a free text field to a set of codes
 field.
   
 A conversion will run in a post install routine to ensure the data in the 
 ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260), PAY RATE PER (#167) field conforms 
 to the new Set of Codes as shown below:
  
      1 -   Weekly                   H -   Hourly
      2 -   Bi-weekly                A -   Annual
      6 -   Daily
  
 The conversion routine will modify the existing data to the correct code
 if it can determine the correct mapping.  If the correct mapping cannot be
 determined, the conversion routine will display the case number and
 existing PAY RATE PER field so the correct value can be entered manually
 after installation of the patch.  The existing data will then be removed.
  
 A new option is provided, Fix PAY RATE PER Field [OOPS FIX PAY RATE PER
 FIELD], so that data that was not converted in the PAY RATE PER Field
 (#167) can be entered.  This option should be attached to the appropriate
 user's Secondary Menu only and should be removed after the data correction
 has been completed.  This option will only allow data entry for Cases
 where the PAY RATE PER field (#167) is blank.
  
 The post-installation routine will also move data in the WITNESS (#115)
 field to the new WITNESS NAME (#.01) field in the WITNESS NAME Subfile
 (#2260.0125) and update the ASISTS DOL ANATOMICAL LOCATION CODES File
 (#2261.1) with new codes required by the Department of Labor (DOL).
   
 Changes to this patch are described below:
  
 1.  EXTRACT AND TRANSMIT DATA TO THE AUSTIN AUTOMATION CENTER
  
 New options have been created that will extract and transmit identified
 data elements from the ASISTS package to the AAC (Austin Automation
 Center) on a daily basis, as well as on an as-needed, manual basis.  In
 order for a case to be transmitted, certain criteria must be met.  The
 required criteria for transmitting an ASISTS case to the AAC are:
 electronic signatures of employee, supervisor, and worker's compensation
 personnel (WCP); the new field, TRANSMIT TO WC/MIS (#67), must be entered;
 required fields must be completed; field NATURE OF DISEASE/ILLNESS (#217)
 cannot contain more than 264 characters, and the following fields cannot
 contain more than 528 characters: SUPERVISOR NOT AGREE EXPLAIN (#164),
 REASON FOR CONTROVERTS COP (#165), RELATIONSHIP OF ILLNESS TO EMP (#216),
 CLAIM NOT FILED (#218), EMPLOYEE STATEMENT DELAYED (#219), WORK DUTY
 CHANGED (#257). All fields listed above are from the ASISTS ACCIDENT
 REPORTING file (#2260).
  
 A mail group, OOPS WC MESSAGE, will be created during the installation and
 must be populated with at least one member in order to transmit claims
 electronically. Users included in this mail group should be the
 individuals who need to be notified of error messages, or messages sent
 from the AAC.  Again, at least one member's name must be entered into this
 mail group.
  
 To schedule the transmission of DOL data [OOPS DOL SCHEDULED XMIT DATA]
 use the Taskman Scheduler option.  This should be scheduled to run on a
 DAILY basis.  After the Worker's Compensation manager has electronically
 signed the claim, indicating that it has been authorized for transmission,
 the claim will be added to other approved claims and will be
 electronically transmitted to the AAC when the scheduled task is run.
 ASISTS claims received by 5:00AM CST, Monday through Friday, excluding
 holidays will be included in the AAC EDI processing for that day so that
 the claims can be forwarded to DOL on the same day.  Claims received after
 5:00AM will be processed and forwarded to DOL the following day. Error
 checking is performed to assure that the data being sent is valid, the
 system is set up as required for sending the mail message, and to ensure
 that mail messages are created correctly.  If an error occurs, a message
 will be sent to another newly created mail group, OOPS WCP, notifying
 members of the problem.  After the errors have been corrected, the data
 will be sent with the next scheduled transmission.  All claims are
 routinely transmitted to the AAC using this option.
  
 The new menu option, Manual Transmission of DOL Data [OOPS DOL MANUAL XMIT
 DATA], should be used for manual transmission only if the message was 
 corrupted during the actual transmission to the AAC and the AAC cannot 
 process claims in the Mailman message.  A new security key, OOPS DOL XMIT 
 DATA, is required to access this menu option from the OOPS WORKER'S COMP 
 MENU and should be assigned to the appropriate users.  This option will 
 allow for queuing, if desired, but IS NOT designed to re-send a corrected 
 claim to the AAC.  Those claims will be transmitted using the Scheduled 
 Transmission of DOL data via Taskman.
  
 A message will be sent to the OOPS WCP mail group with a listing of claims 
 that were successfully included in the mail message that is sent to the 
 AAC.  The OOPS WCP mail group can be set up by Station Number (OOPS WCP - 
 STATION #) using the functionality introduced with OOPS*1.0*7.  The OOPS 
 WCP MESSAGE Mail Group does not have this capability as it is designed to 
 receive messages back from the AAC and the Station number may not be known.
  
  **Before the transmission can be completed it is mandatory that the
    Mailman patch XM*999*136 be installed.  This patch adds a new domain,
    which will be used to transmit ASISTS CA1/CA2 data to the Dept. of Labor
    via the Austin Automation Center.
  
 2.  CREATE ASISTS WORKER'S COMPENSATION MENU [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU]
   
 A new top level ASISTS menu has been created for the Worker's Compensation 
 personnel.  This menu includes the following options:
  
     Change the Status of a Case            [OOPS SAFETY CLOSE]
     Complete Employee CA-1 & CA-2          [OOPS SAFETY EMP ENTER]
     Complete Report of Accident (2162)     [OOPS SAFETY ENTER 2162]
     Create Accident/Illness Record         [OOPS CREATE CASE]
     Create Amendment                       [OOPS CREATE AMENDMENT (SO)]
     Display CA1 or CA2                     [OOPS SAFETY DISPLAY CA1/CA2]
     Edit Report of Incident                [OOPS SAFETY SUP ENTRY]
     Edit Stub Record                       [OOPS SAFETY EDIT STUB RECORD]
     Manual Transmission of DOL Data        [OOPS DOL MANUAL XMIT DATA]
     Print Accident Report Status           [OOPS SAFETY PRINT STATUS]
     Print CA1/CA2                          [OOPS SAFETY PRINT CA]
     Print Employee Bill of Rights          [OOPS PRINT BILL]
     Print Report of Accident               [OOPS SAFETY PRINT]
     Validate and Sign CA1 or CA2           [OOPS WC VALIDATE]
     Worker's Compensation Edit CA1/CA2     [OOPS WC EDIT CA1/CA2]
  
 There is one new option, Worker's Compensation Edit CA1/CA2, [OOPS WC 
 EDIT CA1/CA2] that will be described below.  Additionally, the option, 
 Complete Employee CA-1 & CA-2 has been renamed from Edit Employee CA-1 & 
 CA-2, [OOPS SAFETY EMP ENTER]. 
   
 3.  ADD NEW OPTION, WORKER'S COMPENSATION EDIT CA1/CA2 [OOPS WC EDIT CA1/CA2]
  
 A new option has been added for Worker's Compensation (WCP) personnel to 
 verify the CA1/CA2 claim and complete it as necessary.  This option will 
 provide access to data collected in blocks 14a-c and 17-38 of the CA1 and 
 blocks 9a, 14a-c, and 19-35 of the CA2 as well as the OWCP NOI CODE.  The 
 ability to enter the OWCP Chargeback Code, the OWCP District Office, and 
 multiple Witness(es) information has also been incorporated.  Other than 
 the items detailed below, this option functions similarly to the CA1/CA2 
 portion of the Edit Report Of Incident [OOPS SUP ENTRY].
  
 Additionally, error checking has been implemented to assure that the
 WITNESS NAME (#2260.0125, .01), the PHYSICIAN NAME (#156, #245), and
 SUPERVISOR PHONE NUMBER (#173, #269) format matches Department of Labor
 requirements.
  
 If the Supervisor has not electronically signed the CA1/CA2 when the WCP 
 enters the option, then the WCP will be asked if they are signing for the 
 Supervisor.  A 'Y'es response must be entered for the WCP to be given 
 access to the case.  A 'N'o response returns the user to the menu assuming 
 that the Supervisor needs to electronically sign the claim.
  
 If the Supervisor has signed their portion of the CA1/CA2 prior to WCP 
 accessing the option, this option will determine if the WCP changed
 any of the following fields from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File
 (#2260):
  
   INJURED PERFORMING DUTY (#146)
   NOT INJURED PERFORMING DUTY (#147)
   INJURY CAUSED BY EMPLOYEE (#148)
   CAUSED BY EMPLOYEE EXPLAIN (#149)
   SUPERVISOR AGREE/DISAGREE (#163)
   SUPERVISOR NOT AGREE EXPLAIN (#164)
   REASON FOR CONTROVERTS COP (#165)
  
 If any of the above fields are changed by the WCP, existing data in the 
 following fields is removed and the WCP will complete them and sign as the 
 Supervisor: 
   
   SUPERVISOR EXCEPTIONS (#168)
   NAME OF SUPERVISOR (#169)
   SUPERVISOR TITLE (#172)
   SUPERVISOR OFFICE PHONE (#173)
  
 The following fields from the PAID EMPLOYEE File (#450) will be 'pulled' if 
 data exists:
  
   PAY BASIS (#19)
   SALARY (#28)
   RETIREMENT CODE (#26)
  
 These fields will be 'converted' to valid ASISTS data and used as the 
 default value for the following fields in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
 File (#2260):
  
   EMP RETIREMENT COVERAGE (#60)
   PAY RATE DOLLAR (#166)
   PAY RATE PER (#167)
  
 The Department of Labor (DOL) allows a maximum of 528 characters to be 
 submitted electronically for the following fields in the ASISTS ACCIDENT 
 REPORTING File (#2260) that are collected in this option:
  
   SUPERVISOR NOT AGREE EXPLAIN (#164)
   REASON FOR CONTROVERTS COP (#165)
   WORK DUTY CHANGED (#257)
  
 Error checking has been incorporated on the fields listed above to make 
 sure that the maximum character limit is not exceeded.  If more than 528 
 characters are entered, an error message with the total number of 
 characters that have been entered will be displayed and the user prompted 
 to edit the field.
  
 Two new prompts/fields have also been added for the Worker's Compensation 
 specialist:
  
 36a. DOES THE AGENCY CONTROVERT THIS CLAIM (#165.1)
 36b. DOES THE AGENCY DISPUTE THIS CLAIM (#165.2)
  
 These prompts have Yes/No responses and have been added to designate that 
 the Agency is either controverting or disputing the claim and to document
 that in the claim.  This allows for a differing opinion between the
 Supervisor and Worker's Compensation specialist.  In this option, a Yes
 response must be entered in either question 36a or 36b for the user to be
 able to respond to question 36 - IF THE EMPLOYING AGENCY CONTROVERTS
 CONTINUATION OF PAY, STATE THE REASON IN DETAIL.
  
 If all required fields have been entered, the Supervisor has not signed the 
 claim form and the WCP has indicated that they will be signing as the 
 Supervisor, then they will be prompted to sign as the Supervisor.  
 Otherwise, the Supervisor has signed the claim;  and then the WCP will 
 indicate whether the claim should be transmitted to the AAC.  If the 
 WCP indicates that the claim is ready for transmission, they will be 
 prompted to enter their electronic signature, which is required prior to 
 the claim being transmitted.
  
 If the supervisor has not signed the claim and data validation indicates 
 that there are required fields missing, then those field names will be 
 displayed and the user will be returned to the Worker's Comp menu. 
   
 If the WCP has signed the claim and needs to edit the data for any reason, 
 the claim will be accessible ONLY if the claim has not been transmitted 
 to the AAC.  The WCP's electronic signature will be removed, requiring the
 WCP to resign the claim.
  
 Once the claim has been transmitted to the AAC, access to the CA1/CA2 
 will not be allowed.
  
 Additionally, a check will be made to assure that only one user is entering 
 data on the same case at the same time.
  
  
 4.  MODIFY OPTION, EDIT EMPLOYEE CA1/CA2, [OOPS EMP ENTRY].
  
 The ability to collect the following fields from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORT 
 File (#2260) and WITNESS NAME Sub-File (#2260.0125) has been added:
  
     CAUSE OF INJURY CODE (#126)
     ZIP CODE WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#181)
     ADDRESS WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#183)
     CITY WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#184)
     STATE WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#185)
     OCCUPATION #111 (CA1) or EMPLOYEE OCCUPATION, #208 (CA2)
     WITNESS NAME (#2260.0125, #.01)
     WITNESS ADDRESS (#2260.0125, #1)
     WITNESS CITY (#2260.0125, #2)
     WITNESS STATE (#2260.0125, #3)
     WITNESS ZIP CODE (#2260.0125, #4)
     DATE OF WITNESS SIGNATURE (#2260.0125, #5)
  
 *** It should be noted that at this time we cannot collect the WITNESS
     STATEMENT (#2260.0125, #6) in the computer due to privacy act concerns
     and agreements with the Unions.  This statement should be collected
     via hardcopy, if appropriate and forwarded to DOL.
  
 The fields, ADDRESS WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#183), CITY WHERE INJURY 
 OCCURRED (#184), and STATE WHERE INJURY OCCURRED (#185) were added due to 
 requirements from the AAC and are required fields for the electronic 
 submission to DOL.
  
 Error checking on the Witness Name field (2260.0125, .01) will be preformed 
 to assure that if Witness data has been entered, it is in a format 
 (LASTNAME,FIRSTNAME) that DOL will accept.  Error checking on the HOME 
 PHONE NUMBER field (#12) has been added to assure that the Phone Number 
 matches 10 numbers (Area Code is required) after any punctuation that is 
 entered is removed.  
  
 The ASISTS PAY PLAN field (#63) will be 'pulled' from the PAID EMPLOYEE File 
 (#450), PAY PLAN (#20) if data exists.
  
 The default value for the DATE OF THIS NOTICE field (#110) will be the 
 date the user is entering the data.
  
 The following 3 prompts have been changed at the request of the
 Technical Advisory Group (TAG):
  
 CA1: 
 13. CAUSE OF INJURY (DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY)
 14. NATURE OF INJURY (IDENTIFY BOTH THE INJURY AND THE PART OF THE BODY e.g. 
        FRACTURE OF LEFT LEG)
  
 CA2:
 12. DATE YOU FIRST REALIZED THE DISEASE OR ILLNESS WAS CAUSED BY YOUR       
         EMPLOYMENT
  
 The Department of Labor (DOL) allows a maximum of 528 characters to be 
 submitted electronically for the following fields in the ASISTS ACCIDENT 
 REPORTING File (#2260) that are collected in this option:
  
   RELATIONSHIP OF ILLNESS TO EMP (#216)
   CLAIM NOT FILED (#218)
   EMPLOYEE STATEMENT DELAYED (#219)
   NATURE OF INJURY(#217)
   MEDICAL REPORT DELAYED(#220)
  
 Error checking has been incorporated on the fields listed above to make 
 sure that the maximum character limit is not exceeded.  If more than 528 
 characters are entered, an error message with the total number of 
 characters that have been entered will be displayed and the user will be
 prompted to edit the field.
   
 If the employee does not have an Electronic Signature on file when this 
 option is entered, the user will be prompted to enter an electronic 
 signature and related information after data validation has occurred and the 
 form is eligible for employee signature.
  
 In order to ensure Employee data integrity after the Employee has signed the 
 claim, special processing is completed on the Employee data.  This 
 verification checking is completed to ensure that the data entered by 
 the Employee is the data being sent to the AAC.  If any problems are 
 detected during the data extraction/transmission to the AAC, the 
 Employees', Supervisors' and Workers' Compensation Specialists' signature 
 will be removed and mail bulletins will be sent to each of them advising 
 that the data has been modified.  If problems are detected when a hardcopy
 CA1/2 is printed, the Employee's name will be replaced with garbled 
 characters to signify that the data has been modified, however, mail 
 bulletins will not be sent as a visual inspection of the signature 
 indicates a problem.
  
  
 5.  MODIFY OPTION, EDIT REPORT OF INCIDENT, [OOPS SAFETY SUP ENTRY] and
     [OOPS SUP ENTRY] (CA1 AND CA2 PORTION ONLY).
   
 The ability to collect the following fields from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORT 
 File (#2260) and WITNESS NAME Sub-File (#2260.0125) has been added:
  
     EMP RETIREMENT COVERAGE (#60) (CA1, CA2)

     WITNESS STATE (#2260.0125, #3) (CA1)
     WITNESS ZIP CODE (#2260.0125, #4) (CA1)
     DATE OF WITNESS SIGNATURE (#2260.0125, #5) (CA1)
  
 *** It should be noted that at this time we cannot collect the WITNESS 
     STATEMENT (#2260.0125, #6) in the computer due to privacy act concerns
     and agreements with the Unions.  If appropriate, this statement should
     be collected via hardcopy and forwarded to DOL.
  
 Additionally error checking has been implemented to assure that the 
 WITNESS NAME (#2260.0125, .01), the PHYSICIAN NAME (#156, #245), and SUPERVISOR 
 PHONE NUMBER (#173, #269) format matches Department of Labor requirements.
  
 The following fields from the PAID EMPLOYEE File (#450) will be 'pulled' if 
 data exists:
  
   PAY BASIS (#19)
   SALARY (#28)
   RETIREMENT CODE (#26)
  
 These fields will be 'converted' to valid ASISTS data and used as the 
 default value for the following fields in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
 File (#2260):
  
   EMP RETIREMENT COVERAGE (#60) (CA1, CA2)
   PAY RATE DOLLAR (#166) (CA1)
   PAY RATE PER (#167) (CA1)
  
 The Department of Labor (DOL) allows a maximum of 528 characters to be 
 submitted electronically for the following fields in the ASISTS ACCIDENT 
 REPORTING File (#2260) that are collected in this option:
  
   SUPERVISOR NOT AGREE EXPLAIN (#164) (CA1)
   REASON FOR CONTROVERTS COP (#165) (CA1)
   WORK DUTY CHANGED (#257) (CA2)
  
 Error checking has been incorporated on the fields listed above to make 
 sure that the maximum character limit is not exceeded.  If more than 528 
 characters are entered, an error message with the total number of 
 characters that have been entered will be displayed and the user prompted 
 to edit the field.
  
 The PHYSICIAN TITLE (#182 or #270) will default from the value entered in 
 the ASISTS SITE PARAMETER File (#2262), STATION Sub-File (#2262.03), field
 PHYSICICAN TITLE (#6). (CA1, CA2)
  
 The DATE NOTICE RECEIVED field (#175) will default from the field DATE OF
 THIS NOTICE (#110), both from the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260).
 (CA1)
  
 The field, FIRST DATE MEDICAL CARE (#250), from the ASISTS ACCIDENT
 REPORTING File (#2260), is no longer required. (CA2)
  
 Additionally, a check will be made to assure that only one user is entering 
 data on the same case at the same time.
   
  
 6.  MODIFY OPTION, DISPLAY CA1 OR CA2, [OOPS SUP DISPLAY CA1/CA2], 
     [OOPS EMP DISPLAY CA1/CA2], [OOPS SAFETY DISPLAY CA1/CA2], 
     [OOPS EMP HLT DISP CA1/CA2].
  
 The new fields have been added to the appropriate claim (CA1 or CA2) for 
 being displayed from this option.

             Restart Install of Package(s) 
             Unload a Distribution 
             Backup a Transport Global 
    
   Select Installation Option: 
    
   5.   Select Installation Option: 
        --------------------------
        NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
               NAME, enter OOPS*1.0*8):
       
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
      
   6.   Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
                                    ----------------
        **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch: 
    
        a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
        b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
            Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer YES.
        c.  When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
            Order':'  Enter the following options:
   
            ASISTS Employee Health Menu          [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU]
            ASISTS Employee Menu                 [OOPS EMP MENU]
            ASISTS Safety Officers Menu          [OOPS SAFETY MENU]
            ASISTS Supervisor Menu               [OOPS SUP MENU]
            ASISTS Union Menu                    [OOPS UNION MENU]
  
        d. When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':
           press <return>.
  
           NONE
  
   7.  Post Installation
  
        a. A post installation routine was run to convert the PAY RATE PER 
           Field (#167) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260).  If
           the message explaining that there were cases where the data could
           not be converted was displayed, you need to notify the 
           appropriate user that manual correction of data is necessary. 
  
        b. Install the Fix PAY RATE PER Field Option [OOPS FIX PAY RATE PER
           FIELD], on the Secondary menu of the user who will be correcting
           the data.  That user should also be provided with a hardcopy
           listing of the cases from the install file so they can determine
           the original data value.
  
           This option provides two ways to access cases needing this field 
           corrected.  It will loop through all cases with a blank PAY RATE
           PER Field (#167) or will allow the user to select an individual
           case.  If only cases that contained data that could not be 
           converted will be corrected, it may be better to select them on
           an individual basis.  If all cases will be corrected, then the
           loop option would be better.
  
        d. Upon completion of the manual data correction, this menu option 
           should be removed from the user's menu.
