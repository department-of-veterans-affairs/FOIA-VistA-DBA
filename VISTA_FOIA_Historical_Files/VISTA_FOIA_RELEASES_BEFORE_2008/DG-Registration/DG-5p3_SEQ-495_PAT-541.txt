Subject: PROBLEM WITH FUZZY LOGIC LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The change in this patch will not be noticeable until patch PRCA*4.5*198
 is installed, and they should be installed together.
  
 The Patient Name Standardization patch DG*5.3*244 introduces changes 
 to the patient look up logic which implement "fuzzy" lookup functionality.
 This allows pick lists to return entries beyond those that match the 
 user's input exactly. With the fuzzy lookups in place a bill number
 such as K301EL2 may also return patients whose names begin with KEL.
 This has an unexpected result on the AR options when the user
 entered bill numbers.
  
 With this patch an Integration Agreement for the Accounts Receivable 
 software package has been approved, this will allow for the correction to 
 the patient fuzzy lookup that has caused sites to have problems when 
 entering a patient or a bill number.

 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 A flag variable DPTNOFZK has been added to the patient lookup logic
 implemented by the DPTLK. It is to associate with the flag variable 
 DPTNOFZY and prevent it from being killed within the AR process.
  
 A flag variable DPTNOFZY has been implemented to allow the suppression
 of fuzzy lookups in DG*5.3*244. A flag variable DPTNOFZK has been added
 to prevent the flag variable DPTNOFZY from being killed within the AR
 process in DG*5.3*541. Patch DG_53_P541.KID has been created to set the
 flag variables at the various points where selection of bill numbers or
 patients occurs.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
    This patch can be installed with users on the system, however it should
    be installed during off hours to minimize disruption to users.
    Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
   Installation Steps:
   ==================
    
   1. Download the KIDS file DG_53_P541.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
      directory of one of the above mentioned sites to the
      appropriate directory on your system.
    
   2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION 
      menu, and enter:  DG_53_P541.KID
   
   3. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patch DG*5.3*541 are mapped, they
      should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
    
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select 
      the Installation menu.
    
   5. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*541):
    
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed. It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
  
   6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       DG*5.3*541.
    
       a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
           YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated).
       b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
           Options, and Protocols? YES//', answer NO.
  
   7.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
       distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
    
       NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 3, or if
       you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
