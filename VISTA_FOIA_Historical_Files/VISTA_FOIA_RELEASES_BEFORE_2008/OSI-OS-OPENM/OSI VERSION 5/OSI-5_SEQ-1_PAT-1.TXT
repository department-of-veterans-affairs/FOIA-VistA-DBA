Subject: HDR CACHE.DAT FILES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 This patch describes the update of the current version X.0.4 HDR 
 CACHE.DAT files with the new version 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 DAT releases.  
  
 The 5.1.1 DAT is for Cache 5.0 installations, and the 5.2.1 DAT is for 
 Cache 5.2 installations.  
  
 Please note that sites should proceed with downloading and unzipping of 
 the new cache.dat file according to instructions in Section 4.2 of the HDR
 Upgrade Guide (available at the anonymous download directories 
 listed below) including locations which have upgraded their Cache 
 installations to Cache 5.2 in connection with RDP relocations.  But they 
 should wait to install the file until the day scheduled for installation 
 with TSO.  TSO will be contacting all sites and working directly with 
 server administration staff members to complete the installation and 
 configuration steps.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
 Sites should FTP the files listed below under "INSTALLATION FILES" and 
 follow the instructions in the upgrade and/or installation document(s) 
 thus downloaded.  The "Upgrade" document contains specific instructions 
 for upgrading from the previous version of the HDR DAT file.  (Any 
 site which, for some reason, needs to completely install and configure 
 the DAT where no previous DAT existed or was configured must follow the 
 complete instructions in the "INSTALL GUIDE" document.)  
  
  
 INSTALLATION FILES: 
 ==================
  
 The following software and documentation files are exported as part of 
 this patch.  Cache 5.0 sites should download the HRDHX_CACHE_5_1_1.ZIP 
 file listed, and Cache 5.2 sites should download the 
 HDRHX_CACHE_5_2_1.ZIP file:
  
    File Name                            Contents          Retrieval Format
    ---------                            --------          ----------------
    HDRHX_CACHE_5_1_1.ZIP                CACHE.DAT File    BINARY
    HDRHX_CACHE_5_2_1.ZIP                CACHE.DAT File    BINARY
    HDRHX_DAT_UPGRADE_5_1_1.PDF          PDF Document      BINARY
    HDRHX_DAT_INSTALL_GUIDE_5_1_1.PDF    PDF Document      BINARY
    ZSTU_V52.RSA                         RSA File          ASCII
  
 Depending on the version of Cache installed on the system, the appropriate 
 ZSTU_V52.RSA file will need to be retrieved, in ASCII format, from one of 
 the following FTP sub-directories:
  
 [.CACHE.CACHE50.AD_HOC_3906] for Cache v5.0.18 systems
 [.CACHE.CACHE50.AD_HOC_4377] for Cache v5.0.21 systems
 [.CACHE.CACHE52.AD_HOC_4821] for Cache v5.2 systems
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:  
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:  
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
 Server configuration for this patch will require an additional 1.5 GB of 
 disc space for a new default dataset   notice of which was sent to VISN 
 CIO s and from them to IT staff some months ago.  Please be aware and 
 prepared for utilization and configuration of this additional disc space 
 as anticipated.
