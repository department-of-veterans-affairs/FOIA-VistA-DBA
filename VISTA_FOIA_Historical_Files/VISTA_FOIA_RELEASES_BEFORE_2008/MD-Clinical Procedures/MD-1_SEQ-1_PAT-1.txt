 Routine MDAPI1 provides the Application Program Interface to retrieve
 the Electrocardiogram data in file #691.5.
      
 Database Integration Agreement #3854 documents the Clinical Procedures
 interface provided by this patch.
  
 The following documents the input and output requirements for this 
 interface.
  
 Entry Point: GET^MDAPI1(RESULTS,MDARDFN,MDSDT,MDEDT,MDFLDS)
  
          Input: RESULTS - the global ^TMP array in   (Required)
                           which to return results.
                 MDARDFN - the patient DFN.           (Required)
                 MDSDT - the start date of the date   (Required)
                         range to return the data.
                         This must be in FM internal

                  ^TMP("NAMESPACE",$J,0) will equal one of the following,
                  if the call failed:
                      -1^No Patient DFN.
                      -1^No Start Date Range.
                      -1^No End Date Range.
