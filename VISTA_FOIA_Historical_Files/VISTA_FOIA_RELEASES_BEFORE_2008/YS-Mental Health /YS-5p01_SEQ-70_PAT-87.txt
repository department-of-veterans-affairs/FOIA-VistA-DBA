Subject: INSTRUMENT USAGE SERVER

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 This patch replaces the Mental Health option Usage Statistics [YSMUSE] with 
 a new Mental Health option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS TEST USAGE].
 This is a server option to be used only by the members of the National Mental 
 Health Strategic Healthcare Group (MHSHG) to determine the annual 
 psychological test instrument usage at a site.
 
 This patch contains one new server option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS 
 TEST USAGE] and one new routine YSTUSE.  Option Usage Statistics [YSMUSE] 
 and routine YTSTAT are deleted during installation of the patch.
 
 The server option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS TEST USAGE] is 
 activated by a mail message.  The mail message invokes the routine YSTUSE 
 which returns the results of the psychological test instrument usage at the 
 site the mail message is sent to.  
 
 This is an example to invoke the server to create the mail message.

 The output from the server request is returned in the form of a MAILMAN
