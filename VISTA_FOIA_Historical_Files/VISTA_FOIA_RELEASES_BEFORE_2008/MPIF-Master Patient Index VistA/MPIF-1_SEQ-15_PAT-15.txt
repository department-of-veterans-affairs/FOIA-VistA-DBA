Subject: Local/Missing ICN Resolution Job 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
   avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as CMORs, Treating
   Facilities or Subscribers.
  
  
   Issue 1:  The Local/Missing ICN Resolution job is currently
   scheduled to run 1 time weekly due to the number of local ICNs
   at the facilities.  This job has been modified so that each
   Local ICN can only be sent to the MPI for resolution one time.
   If the Local ICN wasn't resolved, then an exception is logged
   and a human must resolve the Local ICN.  This will reduce the
   number of Local ICNs sent up each time the job is run.  This
   change will allow the Local/Missing ICN Resolution job to 
   return to running nightly. This change is in routine MPIFRES.
  
   ISSUE 2:  The Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job option
   is currently on the Master Patient Index Menu and is a job that
   should only be run via a TaskMan.  So this patch will remove this
   option from the menu.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.   
  
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
        MPIF*1.0*15.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install? YES//', respond No if you have the night job to rebuild
        menu trees scheduled to run [XQBUILDTREEQUE] otherwise say Yes.

        YES//', respond No.

        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes:
  
       Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job   [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
    9.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
  
   10.  Reschedule via TaskMan the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background
        job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] option to run one time daily after
        10:00pm and before 6:00am.
