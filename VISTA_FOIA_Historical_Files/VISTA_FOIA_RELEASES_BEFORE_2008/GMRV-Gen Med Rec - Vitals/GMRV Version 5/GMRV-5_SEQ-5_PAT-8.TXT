 NOTE: The environment check routine will not allow the installation of 
       this patch if the new Health Data & Informatics (HDI) package is 
       not installed. However, the KIDS build will remain loaded on the
       system.
  
       The post installation routine calls a HDI routine to request the
       VHA Unique Indentification (VUID) data for FILEs 120.51, 120.52
       and 120.53.
  
  
 This patch is an enhancement. It modifies the GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS 
 package to utilize VUID data. 
  
 1) The following changes are made to the data dictionary of the GMRV
 VITAL TYPE (#120.51) file.
  
 a) Field MASTER ENTRY FOR VUID (#99.98) is added. This field is used in 
 the new AMASTERVUID index. See 1d below for the index definition.

                 DESCRIPTION:    The Status of a reference term is either
                                 'ACTIVE' or 'INACTIVE'. If 'ACTIVE', then 
                                 the term will be accessible by end-users
                                 to document a particular patient event. If
                                 'INACTIVE', then the term will only be 
                                 accessible by the application to display 
                                 legacy data.

       Description:  If multiple entries have the same VUID in the file, 
                     this cross-reference can be used to identify the
                     Master entry for a VUID associated with a

 4) The following changes are made to FILEs 120.51, 120.52 and 120.53.
  
 a) The #.01 field is modified to prohibit changes to any enries.
  
  ^DD(file #,.01,7.5)=
  I $G(DIE)'="",'$D(XUMF) K X D EN^DDIOL("Entries must be edited via the
  Master File Server (MFS).","","!?5,$C(7)")
  
  ^DD(file #,.01,"DEL",1,0)=
  D:'$D(XUMF) EN^DDIOL("Entries must be inactivated via the Master File
  Server (MFS).","","!?5,$C(7)") I $D(XUMF)
  
  ^DD(file #,.01,"LAYGO",1,0)=
  D:'$D(XUMF) EN^DDIOL("Entries must be added via the Master File Server
  (MFS).","","!?5,$C(7)") I $D(XUMF)
   
 b) File level access is changed to the "@" sign except for READ access. 
 The READ access is not changed.
  
  ^DIC(file #,0,"AUDIT")=@
  ^DIC(file #,0,"DD")=@
  ^DIC(file #,0,"DEL")=@
  ^DIC(file #,0,"LAYGO")=@
  ^DIC(file #,0,"WR")=@
  
 c) The following statement is added to the file description. 
  
 Per VHA Directive {pending directive #}, this file has been "locked down" 
 by Data Standardization (DS). The file definition (i.e. data dictionary)
 shall not be modified. All additions, changes and deletions to entries in
 the file shall be done by Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) using the
 Master File Server (MFS), provided by Common Services (CS). Creating
 and/or editing locally defined fields in the file are not permitted. Use
 of locally defined fields that were created prior to VHA Directive
 {pending directive #} shall not be supported.
  
 d) The WRITE ACCESS node of every field is set to the up-arrow (^) value. 
 For example:
  
 ^DD(file #,.01,9)="^"
  
 5) The OLD RECORD NUMBER (#999) field in FILE 120.52 is deleted. This 
 field is no longer needed.
  
 6) The Enter/Edit Vitals Qualifiers [GMRV VMSITE] is locked permanently.
 Local facilities will no longer be able to add new qualifiers to the
 package using this option. Instead, the 'New Term Rapid Turnaround'
 process will be used to add or modify qualifiers.
  
 Local facilities will not be able to add or modify qualifiers in the 
 Vitals Graphical User Interface (GUI) either.
  
 Routines affected: GMRVSITE, GMVRPCM
  
 7) The software will check the VUID status value to determine if a FILE 
 120.51 (vital type), 120.52 (qualifier) or 120.53 (category) value is 
 'Active'. Only Active values will be displayed for selection when 
 entering patient data. Old patient records that use "Inactive" values 
 will continue to be shown in reports and displays.
  
 Routines affected: GMVRPCM, GMRVPCE0, GMRVPCE1, GMRVQUAL, GMVQUAL, GMVUID
  
 8) Patient records uploaded to the Health Data Repository (HDR) will 
 contain the VUID numbers and STOP CODE values associated with the GMRV 
 VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) entry.
  
 Routines affected: GMVVDEF1
  
 9) Before installing this patch, the GMRVPCE0, GMRVPCE1, GMRVQUAL and 
 GMRVSITE routines on your system are version 4 routines. The second lines 
 are:
  
 GMRVPCE0
  <tab>;;4.0;Vitals/Measurements;**8**;Apr 25, 1997
  
 GMRVQUAL
  <tab>;;4.0;Vitals/Measurements;**1,11**;Apr 25, 1997
  
 GMRVSITE
  <tab>;;4.0;Vitals/Measurements;**1**;Apr 25, 1997
  
 After installing this patch, these routines will be version 5. The second 
 lines will be:
  
 GMRVPCE0
  <tab>;;5.0;GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS;**8**;Oct 31, 2002
  
 GMRVQUAL

 You should ignore this warning.
  
 10) The ABBREVIATION field (#1) in FILE 120.51 is modified to make the 
 field editable. Before the patch, the second piece of ^DD(120.51,1,0) is 
 "RFI". After the patch, it is "RF".
  
 11) The SYNONYM field (#.02) in FILE 120.52 is modified so that it is no 
 longer a required value for the entry. Before the patch, the second piece
 of ^DD(120.52,.02,0) is "RFX". After the patch, it is "FX".
  
 12) The value of the SYNONYM field (#.02) in FILE 120.52 no longer has to 
 be unique. The GMVFSYN routine is modified to no longer force each SYNONYM
 value to unique.
  
 Routines affected: GMVFSYN
  
 13) Some facilities have an old field called VITALS/MEASUREMENT (#9) in 
 FILE 120.51. This field is no longer used. This patch deletes this field 
 definition and any data, if they exist.
  
 14) The AHDRNEW and AHDRERR indexes on FILE 120.5 are modified. After 
 this patch, these indexes will no longer call the VDEFQM routine if the
 record is for a test patient. Also, the AHDRNEW index uses the PATIENT
 (#.02) field instead of the DATE/TIME VITALS TAKEN (#.01) field.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 1) This patch can be installed with users on the system.
    Installation should take less than 5 minutes.
    These routines are not recommended for mapping.
  
 2) Load the Transport Global.
  
 3) (Optional) Run the following KIDS options before installing the patch:
  
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Verify Checksums in Transport Global
               Backup a Transport Global
  
 4) Install the Build GMRV*5.0*8.
  
    At the 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install' prompt answer
    NO.
  
    At the 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols?' prompt answer with "GMRV*" and "GMV*"
  
 5) Move the routines to other CPUs if appropriate.
  
 6) The post-installation routine, GMV8PST, calls a HDI utility which
    creates an XML file for each of the files being standardized (120.51,
    120.52,120.53). The XML file includes the Term/Concept (Field #.01)
    from each of the three files. Each XML file is then forwarded to the
    central server (FORUM). On the FORUM server, the XML file is compared 
    with the standardized data from Enterprise Terminology Services (ETS). 
    The data received from the facility is modified as follows: 1) FORUM 
    sets a VUID value for every matching entry; 2) local entries are
    assigned a VUID from a block of available numbers, and identified as
    inactive terms; and 3) duplicate entries are identified as inactive
    terms. The information is then passed back to the facility as an XML
    file. The HDI package on the facility's server uses the XML file to
    update the VistA files.
  
    Once the facility's VistA files are updated, a MailMan message is 
    automatically sent to the Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) team.
    The ERT team will manually initiate a Master File Server (MFS) "push" 
    through the Vitria Interface Engine (VIE), which will complete the
    update with standardized data. This ERT update relies on VUIDs as a key
    for inserting the standardized data. At this point, the facility is
    considered standardized for that particular VistA file. 
  
    When Files 120.51, 120.52 and 120.53 are standardized, the GMRV*5*8 
    post-installation routine performs some cleanup tasks. 
  
    The Health Data Repository (HDR) Implementation Managers are notified
    automatically via a MailMan message. This message alerts HDR that the
    site is ready to have the VistA Data Extraction Framework (VDEF) 
    triggers turned on, which enables communication between the facility's 
    VistA server and the HDR/IMS database.
