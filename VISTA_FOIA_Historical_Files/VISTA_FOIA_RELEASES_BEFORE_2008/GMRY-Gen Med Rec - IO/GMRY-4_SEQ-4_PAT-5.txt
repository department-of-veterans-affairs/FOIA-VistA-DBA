  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch creates two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for use
 by version 5.0 of the GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS package (aka
 Vitals/Measurements). These APIs are documented in Integration Agreement
 (IA) #3214.
  
 This patch is distributed with version 5.0 of the GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS 
 package. Software retrieval and installation instructions are included 
 with version 5.0 of the GEN. MED. REC. - VITALS package.
  
 Associated NOIS: None
  
 Associated E3Rs: 17351
  
 The two APIs are in a new routine, GMRYAPI. They are:
  
 1) INPUT()
    This function returns the number of entries in the GMRY INPUT TYPE file
    (#126.56).
  
 2) OUTPUT()
    This function returns the number of entries in the GMRY OUTPUT TYPE
    file (#126.58).
