Description: 
============

 This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) to correct the 
 'Invalid reverse-path specification' transmission error within the Statistical
 Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software package.  This patch
 release will also allow the collection routines to run on Cache for OpenVMS
 platforms.  
  
 All DSM, Cache for Windows NT and Cache for OpenVMS sites are instructed to
 install this patch.  
  
 The original 'Status of SAGG Collection Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] option
 has been renamed as the 'Check SAGG Environment' option.  In addition to
 providing the previous information regarding the SAGG collection routines,
 this option will now check the status of SAGG patch installation at the site. 
  
 The local mail message that is generated when the the SAGG background routines
 complete their collection process has been enhanced to accommodate the
 expanded volume set names found on the Cache for OpenVMS and Cache for Windows
 NT platforms.  In addition, the local message will recommend that the
 background job be run over the weekend hours if the job is started during the
 weekday.
  
 The pre-install routine of this patch will move mail members from the 
 KMPS-SAGG mail group to the KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  The KMP-CAPMAN mail-group
 was created with the release of the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) package.  All
 SAGG notification messages will start utilizing the KMP-CAPMAN mail group. 
 Any mail groups within the MAIL GROUP file that have KMPS-SAGG as a MEMBER
 GROUP will have the KMPS-SAGG entry removed.  
  
 This patch will remove the KMPS-SAGG mail group from the MAIL GROUP file.  The
 'Edit KMPS-SAGG Mail Group' [KMPS SAGG MAIL] option will be deleted.  Use the
 'Capacity Management Mail Group Edit' [KMP MAIL GROUP EDIT] option to change
 the membership of the mail group that will receive package notification
 messages.  
  
 This patch will now allow SAGG to accept alphanumeric characters within the
 site number.  This problem had effected the MPI facility located in Austin.  
  
 This patch will enable the collection of hardware information from sites 
 running DSM.  The hardware information will consist of the hardware name (such
 as Compaq AlphaServer ES40) and the number of active cpu processors installed
 within each node.

 Installation Steps:
 ===================
  
 Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not 
 currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the day
 with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer than
 10-15 minutes.  
        
    1.  Review the mail members of the KMPS-SAGG and KMP-CAPMAN mail groups
        with the FileMan Inquiry option. A pre-install routine will attempt
        to move mail members from the KMPS-SAGG mail group to the 
        KMP-CAPMAN mail group.
  
        Any mail members that are not automatically moved will need to be 
        entered manually with FileMan into the KMP-CAPMAN mail group after
        completion of the patch installation process.
  
        The patch will delete the KMPS-SAGG mail group during the patch 
        installation process.
  
    2.  DSM sites - You will need to disable any routines within the KMPS*
        namespace.  
  
    3.  Download the KIDS file KMPS1_8_2.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
        directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the
        appropriate directory on your system.
  
    4.  Use 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS 'Installation' menu,
        and enter: KMPS1_8_2.KID
        
        Provide the necessary directory path to the file if needed.
  
    5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
        options: 
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global 
  
    6.  As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you 
        do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.  
  
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install 
        Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*2.  
                                                  ==========
  
    8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.  
  
    9.  DSM sites - after the patch has installed, rebuild your map set if
        necessary.  
  
        The KMPS* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to be mapped.    
  
   10.  Review the contents of the KMP-CAPMAN mail group with the FileMan 
        Inquiry option to ensure that the members of the KMPS-SAGG mail 
        group have been properly copied.
