 DESCRIPTION
 ===========
 The M-to-M Broker provides a new implementation of the RPC Broker 
 enabling the exchange of VISTA M-based data and business rules between 
 two VISTA M servers, where both servers reside on the same, or on 
 different VISTA M systems. It has been developed to provide Client/Server 
 functionality resident solely within the VISTA environment.  The 
 requesting server functions in the capacity of a "client." The server 
 receiving that request functions in the capacity of a "server." The 
 Client/Server roles of each server can change depending on at what point 
 in time each VISTA M server is making the request for data from it's 
 counterpart VISTA M server. 
  
 The requesting server and the receiving server can reside on the same, or 
 on different VISTA M systems.  All M-to-M Broker client and server 
 routines are packaged in one KIDS build.  This build will need to be 
 installed on each VISTA system required for M-to-M Broker processing.

 Background
 ==========
  
 VISTA Imaging requested the development of the M-to-M Broker to be used 
 to communicate between the M client on the VISTA Imaging Digital Imaging 
 and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Gateway and the M server on the 
 main VISTA Hospital Information System.
  
 The VISTA Imaging DICOM Gateway architecture uses M software on a 
 workstation to create associations between newly acquired images and the 
 computerized patient record.  Previous to the development of the M-to-M 
 Broker, the gateway system communicated with the main Hospital 
 Information System using the Distributed Data Processing (DDP) protocol, 
 stored the acquired images on NT file servers and set database entries to 
 reference them.
  
 Problems with DDP
  
 * Causes database inconsistencies.
 * Complete lack of security.
 * DDP is bound to MAC addresses.
 * DDP can be very slow on a busy HIS and/or network.
 * DDP runs very slowly in a WAN environment because of inherent network 
   latencies.
  
 Because of the database inconsistency problem, incidents of matching 
 images to the wrong patient occurred at one particular site.
  
 DDP doesn't have any security.  M-to-M Broker uses many of the robust 
 security features implemented by the VISTA RPC Broker and Kernel 
 software.  These security features are transparent to the end user and 
 without additional impact on IRM.
  
 For the VISTA Imaging DICOM Gateway, the M applications on separate VISTA 
 systems will be converted to use this new M-to-M Broker software to 
 communicate to the main HIS.  This will then eliminate the need for DDP 
 where it is used.

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
  
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
  
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
       This patch can be queued and installed at any time.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XWB*1.1*28'
                              ==========
  
      Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO 
  
      Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
  
      Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                                                     
  
   6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
