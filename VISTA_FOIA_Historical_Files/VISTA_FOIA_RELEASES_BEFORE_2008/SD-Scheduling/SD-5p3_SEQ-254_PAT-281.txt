Subject: PRINT SCHEDULING LETTERS - CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch modifies the Scheduling option PRINT SCHEDULING LETTERS
  [SDPRLETTERS] to comply with the following:
  
  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
  software will be enhanced to comply with Health Insurance Portability and 
  Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules for Confidential Communications 45 CFR 
  164.552 to accommodate a patient's request to receive confidential 
  communications at one alternative address or in person at the Department of 
  Veterans Affairs health care facility where the information is maintained. 
  VHA must comply with these requirements by April 2003. 
  
  
  FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  ===================
  When a user selects option PRINT SCHEDULING LETTERS [SDPRLETTERS], the
  patient's address is printed on the letter.  If the patient has 
  requested that their current Scheduling/Appointment correspondence be sent 
  to a confidential address, then that confidential address will be printed
  on the letter.
  
   
  TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
  ==================
  Routine SDLT has been modified to check several values in the array returned
  from API ADD^VADPT.  Based on these values, the appropriate address will
  be printed on the Scheduling letter.
