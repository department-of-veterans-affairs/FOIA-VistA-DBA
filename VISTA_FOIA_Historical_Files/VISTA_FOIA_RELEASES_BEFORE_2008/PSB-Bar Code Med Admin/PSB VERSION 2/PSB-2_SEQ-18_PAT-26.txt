Subject: SCHEDULE ERROR NOTIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Problem: If there is a continuous order, with admin times, and 
 the frequency is null, the GUI Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
 does not display the order on the Virtual Due List (VDL) and a Due 
 List Error Notification message is not generated.
 
 Corrective Action: BCMA will generate a Due List Error Notification 
 message for those continuous orders that contain a standard schedule 
 with admin times and no frequency. This can also occur to non-standard 
 schedules. Pharmacy should review the problem order and make necessary 
 corrections.
 
 If a Due List Error Notification message is encountered with a reason of
 "Invalid frequency received from order", please do the following.
 
 Determine if the schedule listed in the Due List Error Notification
 message is in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). 
   a. If the schedule IS NOT in File #51.1, log a NOIS.
   b. If the schedule IS in File #51.1, determine if the Type of 
      Schedule is Continuous.
          i. If the schedule type IS NOT continuous, log a NOIS.
         ii. If the schedule type IS continuous, determine if the  
             frequency is a valid number greater than zero.
             1. If the frequency IS a valid number greater than zero,log 
               a NOIS.
             2. If the frequency IS NOT a valid number greater than zero,
                correct the frequency.
