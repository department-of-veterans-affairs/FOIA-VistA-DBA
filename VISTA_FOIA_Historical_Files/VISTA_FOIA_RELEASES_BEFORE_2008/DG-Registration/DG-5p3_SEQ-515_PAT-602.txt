Subject: Transmitting Combat Veteran End Date to HEC

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

  This patch will allow transmission of the Combat Veteran (CV) End Date to
  the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) and assist in preventing an enrollment
  rejection letter from being sent to CV eligible veterans.
  
  As a VistA site identifies a CV Eligible veteran and enrolls him/her in
  the system, the CV End Date is calculated. This CV End Date will be
  transmitted to the HEC.
  
  A post-install routine will populate the HEC with all Veterans that have a
  CV Eligibility End Date on or after 1/17/2003 at the local VistA sites.
  
  The above functionality will allow the HEC to identify Combat Veterans and
  prevent the Enrollment Rejection letter from being sent to Enrollment
  Priority 8 veterans who are eligible for care under CV Eligibility.
  
  DATA DICTIONARY CHANGE: 
  =======================
  A new cross-reference has been added to the COMBAT VETERAN END DATE field of 
  the PATIENT file to trigger HL7 (Z07) messages to HEC when the Combat Veteran
  End Date changes.
  
   PATIENT (#2) FILE
   -----------------
    FIELD: COMBAT VETERAN END DATE (#.5295)
  
    CROSS REF NAME:   AENR5295
              TYPE:   MUMPS
        Node: 1       D EVENT^IVMPLOG(DA)
        Node: 2       D EVENT^IVMPLOG(DA)
        Node: 3       DO NOT DELETE
  
                      This cross-reference is used to notify HEC of changes
                      to the COMBAT VETERAN END DATE field.

  1. Download the KIDS file DG_53_P602.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
     directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the 
     appropriate directory on your system.
    
  2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, 
     and enter: DG_53_P602.KID. 
    
  3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE 
     SUMMARY section of patches DG*5.3*602 or IVM*2*98 are mapped, they
     should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
    
  4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
     the Installation menu.

        a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
    
        d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
   
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select DG*5.3*602.

  a Z07 message to the HEC system for all entries that have a value in the
  COMBAT VETERAN END DATE (#.5295) field greater than 1/15/2003.
