Subject: COMBAT VETERAN AND OTHER INFORMATION ADDED TO PAIT

Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch is a continuation of the Patient Appointment Information 
  Transmission (PAIT) project. The previously released patches are:
   
  SD*5.3*290
  SD*5.3*333
  SD*5.3*349
   
  The following enhancements, modifications and fixes are addressed:
   
  1. COMBAT VETERAN (CV)
   
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several 
  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture 
  (VistA) packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - 
  "Combat Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After 
  Separation From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For 
  Service Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and 
  other medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of 
  service connection.
   
  A definition of the Combat Service taken from Attachment A of VHA DIRECTIVE 
  2004-017, April 2004 is:
   
  Combat Service - Veterans who served in combat during a period of war after 
  the Gulf War, or against a hostile force during a period of hostilities 
  after November 11, 1998, qualify, and are eligible for hospital care, 
  medical services, and nursing home care for 2 years after discharge from 
  the military for any illness.  
   
  Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative has been developed 
  and introduced in a phased implementation strategy.
  The Combat Veteran information included in PAIT is evaluated and 
  transmitted based on the already released related patches.
    
  New HL7 message segments have been created and existing message segments 
  have been changed to incorporate CV data. The additions are described below, 
  summarized with the following format for each data item:
  
  Data item  (source of data; assume Patient file if no other filename) - 
  segment.sequence
  
  1.1   Combat Veteran Eligibility field (calculated by a call to the ZEL 
        segment)  -  ZEL.37
   
  Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical care - 
  CV eligibility will be calculated with the Appointment Creation Date passed 
  as the treatment date. It indicates if the patient was eligible for CV 
  status on the Appointment Creation Date. 
  The result of the existing Registration API that creates the ZEL segment is 
  modified by executing a separate call documented in DBIA # 4156 - NAME: 
  COMBAT VETERAN STATUS. 
  In the call to CVEDT^DGCV(DFN,DGDT), DGDT is now passed as
  the appointment creation date, to reflect the CV Status in reference to 
  this date. 
  ZEL-37:  COMBAT VETERAN ELIGIBILITY is determined based on the Date 
  Appointment Created, see SCH.11. The following values from table
  VA01 are used:
    1 (Yes) is sent if the patient was/is considered a combat veteran;
    0 (No) is sent if the patient wasn't/isn't considered a combat veteran.
   
  1.2    Combat Veteran End Date field (.5295 of the Patient file) - ZEL.38
   
  This field represents the last day for combat veteran eligibility. The 
  calculated CV End Date indicates that a veteran has been CV eligible at 
  some point in time. Even if the CV eligibility has expired, this date will 
  be populated.
   
   
  1.3 Combat Veteran Indication (COMBAT VETERAN field # 80007 of the Visit 
 file # 9000010) - [ZCL].3[7]
   
  The Combat Veteran classification question is asked during the check out 
  process or when updating the appointment's classifications.
  
  A seventh repetition of the ZCL (VA Specific
  Classification) segment was added that includes the answer to the Combat 
  Veteran classification question, see table SD008:
   
  Table SD008 - Outpatient Classification Type
   
  VALUE  DESCRIPTION
  --------------------
  1      AGENT ORANGE
  2      IONIZING RADIATION
  3      SERVICE CONNECTED
  4      ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS
  5      MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA
  6      HEAD AND/OR NECK CANCER
  7      COMBAT VETERAN
   
  This will be included in the existing ZCL segment in the same way as other 
  
  classifications are currently.
   
  2. MILITARY HISTORY
   
  The Military History data is retrieved and transmitted so that the waiting 
  time experienced by service members recently returning from the Iraq war can
  be calculated. A new ZMH segment is implemented - IE #: 4495.
   
  Table PAIT01 - Details of the field number for each field 
                 transmitted with PAIT:

  3. "Job Started" message on Forum server.
   
  A message will be generated from each site as soon as a new 
  transmission starts and it will be sent to the Forum server.
  A tasked job on the Forum server will identify any site that has not
  started on the date following the PAIT scheduled date.
  A related reporting function will be available on Forum for
  the National Help Desk (NHD) and  Enterprise VistA Support (EVS).
   
  4. Post-installation updates:
   
    4.1 Update sites that have not received HL7 acknowledgement (ACK) 
    messages during the seeding process due to communication problems.
    Approximately 50% of seeding sites have not received
    acknowledgements and the expected process of flagging rejected 
    appointments and removing the final, acknowledged ones, has not been 
    performed. A post-init routine, working as a driver, will identify a 
    particular sites where there is a need to execute the acknowledgement 
    process, by retrieving rejected appointments from routines containing
    site-specific data only for sites with rejections. Appointments not
    rejected are processed as acknowledged.
   
  NOIS addressed:
   
  UNY-0404-12154            PAIT SEEDING
   
    4.2 Clean up entries in the Patient Appointment Info file (#409.6) that 
        report errors already resolved by later transmissions.
   
  Discrepancies have been identified between the error report that the site can
  generate using the Rejected Transmission [SD-PAIT REJECTED] option and the 
  error report generated by the Austin Automation Center (AAC). The causes of  
  the discrepancies are acknowledgements not coming to some sites after each 
  run, and acknowledgements not coming on time for the previous transmissions. 
  Currently it is the acknowledgement process that initiates cleaning
  the previously rejected entries. Patch SD*5.3*376 will perform a clean up
  of all entries except of those in the pending status. 
   
  NOIS addressed:

  5.  Forum Server accepts and processes new completion messages from the VistA 
  Interface Engine and Austin Automation Center.
   
  6.  HL7 subcomponent modifications to Provider AIP.3 segment: 
  If a middle initial and/or a suffix were not identified and transmitted, 
  the HL7 message did not include '~' as the end of AIP.3. The optional 
  delimiters are now included as requested by AAC.
   
  7.  Interrupted Transmission Repair Process Fix:
  A separate option SD-PAIT Last Run Repair [SD-PAIT REPAIR] will be
  available to repair the interrupted PAIT transmission, while the
  follow-up finishing run may be scheduled independently. The SD-PAIT REPAIR
  option must be run before the additional transmission is started.
  If there is an attempt to start a new transmission but the previous one is 
  not completed the task will abort, and a message will be sent to the SD-PAIT 
  mail group:
  
  "The PAIT requested task has been terminated.
   The previous task #: 2784037 run #: 9 has not been completed.
   The previous run errored out, not repaired!
   Address a problem and use option SD-PAIT REPAIR to fix the run." 
  
  Whenever an interrupted transmission is repaired a completion message to
  the National Help Desk will be generated asking them to initiate a NOIS to
  follow up with verification of the problem. An additional run must be started
  by the site to transmit the expected appointments for the current time period
  if the new transmission can be still processed by Austin Automation  
  Center.

  8. Automated Verification on Forum server that requires
  elements from:
                - Vista Interface Engine messaging team
                - AAC team
   
  VistA IE is expected to report the number of batches received per site, 
  and AAC is expected to report the number of batches received and a total of 
  all received appointments. Any discrepancies with the VistA completion  
  messages will generate messages to the National Help Desk.
   
  9. Modification of completion messages
  More descriptive information is generated with different PAIT completion 
  messages.
   
   The existing completion message format that is sent to the local SD-PAIT 
  Mail Group and to the Forum server is as follows:
   
  Subj: 500 - PAIT BACKGROUND JOB  [#1955306] 09/15/04@14:23  13 lines
  From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
  
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
  The PAIT job has completed - TASK #: 2693498 Log #: 1 on 9/15/04@14:23
  Started: 9/15/04                        Last Scanned: 9/14/04
  Pending appointments:        398
  Final appointments:          622

   In addition to this existing completion message format the following
  informational messages may be generated:
   
    9.1 If this is a clean run and totals of generated (Gen) and sent (Sent)
        batches are the same the only additional message is:
   
       "SUCCESS: Transmission completed."
   
    9.2 If the number of (Gen-Sent) is less than the number of generated 
       batches (Bch) that means that the transfer from the VistA site to 
       the local Interface Engine (IE) is still in progress, and the following 
       information will be sent:
   
        ex.: "WARNING: 2 out of 7 batches still have to be transmitted, 
              please verify with the HL7 System Monitor."
   
    9.3 If PAIT is stopped by a user it will finish cleanly but the below
        message will be sent additionally to the NHD.
   
        "WARNING: TASK STOPPED BY USER, NEEDS TO BE RESTARTED.
        INITIATE a NOIS to FOLLOW UP."
   
   
    9.4 If the SD-PAIT HL Logical Link is "Shutdown", as shown in the above 
        example of a completion message, it will be sent with the   
        following note to the NHD:
   
   
        "SD-PAIT Logical Link has to be started!"
         
   
    9.5 If (Gen)-(Sent) is not less than (Bch) and SD-PAIT Logical Link
        status is not "Shutdown", the problem is probably related to
        communication between VistA and the IE and the following message
        will complement the completion message sent additionally to the NHD:
        
        "Initiate a NOIS for VistA Interface Engine - communication 
         problem."
   
    9.6 When PAIT starts, it verifies that the prior transmission was 
        completed. If it wasn't completed the following message is
        generated if SD-PAIT MANUAL TRANSMISSION is used:
  
        "The previous run errored out, not repaired!
         Please address a problem and then use option SD-PAIT REPAIR to fix
         the run."
  
         If PAIT is queued and the last run is not completed a message is 
          sent to the SD-PAIT Mail Group:
  
         "The PAIT requested task has been terminated.
          The previous task #: 2784037 run #: 9 has not been completed.
          The previous run errored out, not repaired!
          Address a problem and use option SD-PAIT REPAIR to fix the run."
   
    9.7  If the last PAIT run is repaired from the SD-PAIT Repair option
         the following note is added to the completion message:
          
         ex.:
   
         "WARNING!!!: Transmission of run#: 10 has been repaired.
          Please create a NOIS to verify if the problem has been addressed."
  
         Additionally if (Gen)-(Sent) is not less than (Bch) the problem
         is probably related to communication, and the following information
         will be added:
   
       "WARNING!!!: Transmission communication problem, please review."
   
  10.  Appointment Selection Logic.
   
  The following issue will be addressed:
   
 Appointments with a NULL creation date or a 'bogus' value not representing
 the VistA required date format for the DATE APPT. MADE field (# 20)
 of the APPOINTMENT SUBFILE (# 1900) in the Patient file (# 2), have 
 been identified at some sites, and can be categorized as data corruption. 
 The NULL creation date values were transmitted and the appointments were 
 rejected. With this patch, the "ASADM" cross-reference in the Patient file 
 will be checked for duplicates to eliminate resending null creation dates 
 where the appointment has since been edited and a creation date exists.

  11. Patient Class evaluation.
   
  The current scheduling API returns only an OUTPATIENT/INPATIENT 
  status in relation to the Appointment sub file (#2.98).
  It does not check the Patient Status In/Out field (#15002) in the Visit 
  file (#9000010), therefore, returning under some conditions, a NULL value.
  This patch will change the process so that both the Visit(#9000010) and 
  the Outpatient Encounter (#409.68) files will be evaluated to determine the
  proper Patient Class. 
   
  12. The cleaning process will be performed at the end of transmission 
      instead of during the acknowledgement process. This change will make
      the cleaning process independent of acknowledgements, see 4.1
   
  13. An informational message will be displayed to the user explaining why 
      queuing of the manual option, Manual Startup PAIT Transmission 
      [SD-PAIT MANUAL TRANSMISSION], is disallowed, when applicable.
      The following message will be displayed:
  
  You attempted to start PAIT outside the authorized transmission dates.
  Job has been terminated.
   
   NOIS addressed:

  14. This patch protects against errors due to a missing entry in the 
  Patient Appointment Info Log file (#409.6) with a false "Y" cross reference,
  while scanning previously sent appointments.
  
  DAY-0704-41003  PAIT - transmitted 4 batches, no completion message
   
  15. Currently, if an appointment is newly created and then cancelled, its 
  status as a count or non-count clinic is not known. Additional verification
  is performed to determine the clinic type for canceled appointments,
  and if the clinic is 'NON-COUNT' it will receive 'NC' or 'RSN' as its
  appointment type. 'RSN' is a new Appointment Type value:
   
  RSN    Re-schedule for Non Count
   
  The following canceled appointments will be anticipated for the Schedule
  Information Unsolicited (SIU) Message Type: 
   
  SIU Event Mapping Table

  S15   Final     Cancelled Terminated (CT)       Non Count (NC)
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Clinic (CC)        Re-schedule (RS)
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Clinic (CC)        Re-schedule for Non Count (RSN)
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Clinic (CC)        
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Clinic (CC)        Non Count (NC)

  S15   Final     Cancelled by Patient (CP)       Re-schedule for Non Count (RSN)
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Patient (CP)       
  S15   Final     Cancelled by Patient (CP)       Non Count (NC)
   
  If Appointment Type is not indicated or is 'RS' it will be interpreted as 
  scheduled for a 'COUNT' clinic.
  
  16 Field Name Change
  --------------------
  
  The name of sub field #2 of Patient field #2 in file #409.6 was changed
  from HL7 BATCH # to HL7 MESSAGE ID.
  
  17 Canceled Terminated Evaluation Modification
  ----------------------------------------------
  
 If an appointment is canceled and another one is scheduled for the same 
 Appointment Date/Time, then the previous one will get Canceled Terminated 
 as the Event Reason, regardless of whether it was already canceled and 
 transmitted in a previous run or if it was cancelled and transmitted in the 
 current run with the new appointment that has the same Appointment 
 Date/Time. This situation is automatically recognized when appointments have
 the same Appointment Date/Time, but  different Creation Dates. The original 
 Creation Date is retrieved from the Patient Appointment Info Log file 
 #409.6, then overwritten in VistA by the Creation Date of the new appointment
 that has the same Appointment Date/Time.
