Description:
============

 After the recent hurricane that hit the Louisiana and 
 Mississippi areas, the Chief Business Office (CBO) requested 
 that certain activities within VistA Accounts Receivable (AR)
 be suspended to assist those veterans living in impacted
 zip code areas designated by the Federal Emergency
 Management Agency (FEMA).  
  
 The Chief Business Office has requested that a new
 Emergency Response Indicator be created and populated
 with a "Hurricane Katrina" designation for all those that we
 identify as being within the known FEMA designated disaster
 areas.  A search has been run on a backup copy of the
 Health Eligibility Center's (HEC) production system to find those
 in the affected zip code regions.  The indicator will be
 populated on the HEC production system, transmitted to
 all medical centers that have seen the affected patient, and
 made available to all interested application groups.  As the
 patient moves from place to place, the indicator will follow
 to ensure the proper processing of billing. 
  
 The CBO is recommending the following VistA jobs in
 Accounts Receivable (AR) be suspended for an undefined
 period of time to support the veterans impacted by
 Hurricane Katrina in the designated ZIP Code areas established
 by FEMA:
  
 1) Automated referral of new eligible delinquent debts to the
 Treasury Offset Program (TOP). 
  
 Routine RCTOPD will accommodate the change to suspend the
 referral to TOP for all new patients that have not been
 previously referred.  Those referrals already in existence will
 not be suspended. The suspensions will take place for only
 those patients in the affected zip code regions using the Hurricane
 Katrina indicator populated on the HEC production system.
  
  
 2 ) Referral of new debts to the Debt Management Center (DMC).
  
 Routine RCDMC90 will accommodate the change to suspend
 the referral to DMC for all new patients that have not been
 previously referred.  Those referrals already in existence will
 not be suspended. The suspensions will take place for only those
 patients in the affected zip code regions using the Hurricane Katrina
 indicator populated on the HEC production system.
  
  
 Two new fields will be added to the AR SITE PARAMETER file (#342)
 to store the beginning and ending dates for the suspension of
 the billing processes. These fields are the Emergency Response Begin 
 Date (#342,30) and Emergency Response End Date (#342,31).  The post 
 init RCYPO236 will populate these fields with the dates the suspension 
 of the billing processes will take place.  If need be, the Agency 
 Location Code (Deposits) option [PRCA  AGENCY LOCATION]  will allow 
 the site to change the end date if it needs to be extended or shortened.
