Subject: NO-SHOW LETTERS PRINTING FOR NO ACTION TAKEN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix a problem that exists when printing No-Show letters.  
 No-Show letters are being inappropriately printed for patients whose 
 appointment has a status of either Act Req/Checked Out or No Action Taken.
 It will also correct an error that sometimes occurs when using menu option
 Set Up a Clinic.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD104042 - No Show Letters printing for Checked Out and No Action
                Taken Appointments 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, No-Show letters are inappropriately printing for patients
     with appointments that have a status of Act Req/Checked Out and No
     Action Taken.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDN1 will be modified so that No-Show letters will no longer
     print for appointments with a status of Act Req/Checked Out or No
     Action Taken.
  
 2)  HD64905  - Error - <DIVIDE>G2+10^SDB0
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Periodically, when using menu option Set Up a Clinic to set up a new
     clinic, a user will time-out at either the OVERBOOKS/DAY MAXIMUM
     prompt or the LENGTH OF APP'T prompt.  If they then go back into the
     Set Up a Clinic option and up-arrow ("^") at any prompt (other than
     NAME), they will jump to the AVAILABILITY DATE prompt.  If they enter
     a valid date, they will then be prompted for TIME.  Again, if they
     enter valid data, they will then error for <DIVIDE>G2^SDB0 because
     no data was entered for Length of Appointment.  The value of this
     field is used in a division calculation, so the division by zero
     error occurs.  This error will only occur if the user times out as
     stated above.  Normally, when setting up a new clinic, an up-arrow
     is not allowed and the Length of Appointment field is a required
     entry.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A check will be added to routine SDB, just prior to the Availability
     Date prompt, to insure a value has been entered for the Length of
     Appointment.  If the field is null, the user will be returned to the
     Select CLINIC NAME prompt.
