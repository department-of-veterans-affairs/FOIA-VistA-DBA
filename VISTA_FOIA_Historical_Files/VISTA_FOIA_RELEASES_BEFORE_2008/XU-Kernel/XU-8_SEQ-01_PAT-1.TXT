  DOCUMENTATION:
  ==============
  GETACT^XQALERT: Return Information Needed to Run Alert
  
  Format    D GETACT^XQALERT(alertid)
  
  Input     alertid:   Full alert identifier of an unprocessed
                       alert for the current user. The alert
                       identifier consists of three semicolon
                       pieces:
  
                        pkgid_";"_duz_";"_time
  
                       where pkgid is the original package
                       identifier (original value of the XQAID
                       variable when the alert was created via 
                       SETUP^XQALERT), duz is the DUZ of the user
                       who created the alert, and time is the time
                       the alert was created (in VA FileMan
                       format). The alert identifier uniquely
                       identifies a particular alert (it is used as
                       the value of the .01 field in the ALERT
                       TRACKING file).
  
  Output    XQADATA:   Any data passed as XQADATA at the time the 
                       alert was generated. 
  
            XQAID:     The full alert identifier (as defined
                       above).  If the requested alert was not 
                       found, XQAID is returned as null.
  
            XQAOPT:    Name of the option to be run (if not null).
                       Whether an option, routine (or nothing) 
                       should be run when the alert is processed is
                       determined by the value of XQAROU.
  
            XQAROU:    Name of the routine to be run (includes tag
                       if necessary).  This value can be in one of
                       the following three formats, which
                       determines what action, if any, should occur
                       when the alert is processed:
  
                         - If null, the value of XQAOPT should be
                           used when the alert is processed, to run
                           an option. 
  
                         - If "^ " (caret plus a space), the alert
                           is information-only.
  
                         - If "^ROUTINE" or "TAG^ROUTINE", the 
                           value of XQAROU should be used when the
                           alert is processed, to run a routine.
  
  Description
  
  Use GETACT^XQALERT to obtain information about an unprocessed
  alert for the current user. 
  
  If the requested alert is already processed, not found, or not an
  alert for the current user, the return value of XQAID is null.
  
  One use of GETACT^XQALERT is within a GUI environment.  You may
  want to get information on an alert, and based on that
  information decide whether or not to process the alert. GUI-based
  programs might need to check if the alert is GUI-compatible, for
  example.  The alert could then be run, if compatible, using the
  ACTION^XQALERT entry point.  
  
  
  
  
  DOOPT^XQALDOIT: Run an Option
  
  Format    D DOOPT^XQALDOIT(option)
  
  Input     option:   Name of an option to run (value of the
                      option's .01 field).
  
  Output    none      
  
  Description
  
  Use DOOPT^XQALDOIT to run an option within executing M code. All
  security that applies to an option running by Menu Manager is
  also applied to an option run from DOOPT^XQALDOIT. In the case
  that access to an option is denied (e.g., the option is out of
  order, not in a user's menu tree, locked with a key the user 
  does not have, etc.), a message is issued to the user stating
  that the option could not be run.
   
  The option that is run must be one of the following types:
  
   - action
   - edit
   - inquire
   - print
   - run routine
   - ScreenMan
  
  The option that is run cannot be any of the other option types
  (menu, protocol, protocol menu, extended action, server, or
  limited).
