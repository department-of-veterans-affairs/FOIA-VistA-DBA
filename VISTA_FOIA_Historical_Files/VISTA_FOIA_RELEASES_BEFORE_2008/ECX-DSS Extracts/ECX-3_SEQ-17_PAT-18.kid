"DATA",727.1,1,1,5,0)
The Gains and Losses Sheet is the primary VistA report against which ADM
"DATA",727.1,1,1,6,0)
extract data should be verified.  However, if starting the verification
"DATA",727.1,1,1,7,0)
process at the beginning of the fiscal year, the Bed Status Report can also
"DATA",727.1,1,1,8,0)
be used.  Copies of these reports are readily available from patient
"DATA",727.1,1,1,9,0)
administration services at most medical centers.
"DATA",727.1,1,1,10,0)
   
"DATA",727.1,1,1,11,0)
The G&L Sheet shows admissions by ward for a specific day.  To verify the
"DATA",727.1,1,1,12,0)
data on the extract audit report, the verifier must accumulate the data
"DATA",727.1,1,1,13,0)
given on the G&L Sheet  either manually or through use of a spreadsheet
"DATA",727.1,1,1,14,0)
application. For example, if the Admission Extract Audit Report covers
"DATA",727.1,1,1,15,0)
the period July 1 to July 15, then accumulate the admission data from the
"DATA",727.1,1,1,16,0)
G&L Sheet for each day from July 1 through July 15.  The accumulated data
"DATA",727.1,1,1,17,0)
for a given ward (e.g.,total number of admissions for Ward A during the
"DATA",727.1,1,1,18,0)
period) should match the figure reported on the extract audit for the same
"DATA",727.1,1,1,19,0)
ward and date range.
"DATA",727.1,1,1,20,0)
 
"DATA",727.1,1,1,21,0)
If verification is done through the Bed Status Report, simply use the
"DATA",727.1,1,1,22,0)
"Cumulative Totals" table which displays fiscal year-to-date totals of
"DATA",727.1,1,1,23,0)
interward losses and discharges by ward group.  The Admission (ADM) Extract
"DATA",727.1,1,1,24,0)
Audit also displays totals by ward group.  Some arithmetic manipulation is
"DATA",727.1,1,1,25,0)
needed here in order to compare the figures on the two reports.  For
"DATA",727.1,1,1,26,0)
example, to verify data for the month of July, the user must first develop
"DATA",727.1,1,1,27,0)
a "Cumulative Totals" table for the month of July.  This is done by
"DATA",727.1,1,1,28,0)
subtracting the figures contained in the "Cumulative Totals" table of
"DATA",727.1,1,1,29,0)
June 30 from the figures contained in the "Cumulative Totals" table of
"DATA",727.1,1,1,30,0)
July 31.  (Again, this can be accomplished manually, or with the aid of a
"DATA",727.1,1,1,31,0)
spreadsheet application.)  The resulting month of July table can then be
"DATA",727.1,1,1,32,0)
compared directly to the ward group totals shown on the extract audit
"DATA",727.1,1,1,33,0)
report generated for the period July 1 to July 31.

Nursing application's Report 10-1106 Segment 200, Cumulative Daily Patient
"DATA",727.1,4,1,9,0)

"DATA",727.1,4,1,10,0)
on this report may not exactly match those on the Nursing (NUR) Extract
"DATA",727.1,4,1,11,0)
Audit Report.  The reason for this is that the DSS Nursing extract does not
"DATA",727.1,4,1,12,0)
include classification data for any patient discharged or transferred on
"DATA",727.1,4,1,13,0)
the same day, but after the classification took place.  So the figures on
"DATA",727.1,4,1,14,0)
the NUR extract report may occassionally be slightly lower for some Nursing
"DATA",727.1,4,1,15,0)
locations. 
"DATA",727.1,4,1,16,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,4,1,17,0)
It is recommended that the Cumulative Daily Patient Classification Data

"DATA",727.1,4,1,19,0)

"DATA",727.1,7,1,7,0)
process at the beginning of the fiscal year, the Bed Status Report can

specific day.  To verify the data on the extract audit report, the 
"DATA",727.1,7,1,13,0)
verifier must accumulate the data given on the G&L Sheet either 
"DATA",727.1,7,1,14,0)
manually or through use of a spreadsheet application. For example,
"DATA",727.1,7,1,15,0)
if the Movement (MOV) Extract Audit Report covers the period July 1
"DATA",727.1,7,1,16,0)
to July 15, then accumulate the transfer and discharge data from the
"DATA",727.1,7,1,17,0)
G&L Sheet for each day from July 1 through July 15.  The accumulated
"DATA",727.1,7,1,18,0)
data for a given ward (e.g.,total number of transfers out and total
"DATA",727.1,7,1,19,0)
number of discharges for Ward A during the period) should match 
"DATA",727.1,7,1,20,0)
the figures reported on the extract audit for the same ward and
"DATA",727.1,7,1,21,0)
date range.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,22,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,7,1,23,0)
Please note that the Movement (MOV) Extract Audit Report shows a
"DATA",727.1,7,1,24,0)
detailed break-out of both transfers and discharges by movement type.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,25,0)
Individual totals by movement type are listed for each ward, thereby
"DATA",727.1,7,1,26,0)
enabling the user to verify data with much specificity.  If the user
"DATA",727.1,7,1,27,0)
does not care to verify data to this level of detail, then the figure
"DATA",727.1,7,1,28,0)
in the last column of each row should be used.  This figure represents
"DATA",727.1,7,1,29,0)
the total number of transfers or discharges of all types for a given
"DATA",727.1,7,1,30,0)
ward during the date range selected.  The section of the MOV Extract
"DATA",727.1,7,1,31,0)
Audit Report which shows MAS Movement (Transfer) Types is reporting
"DATA",727.1,7,1,32,0)
number of interward transfer losses for each ward.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,33,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,7,1,34,0)
If verification is done through the Bed Status Report, simply use the
"DATA",727.1,7,1,35,0)
"Cumulative Totals" table which displays fiscal year-to-date totals of
"DATA",727.1,7,1,36,0)
interward losses and discharges by ward group.  The Movement (MOV) Extract
"DATA",727.1,7,1,37,0)
Audit also displays totals by ward group.  Some arithmetic manipulation is
"DATA",727.1,7,1,38,0)
needed here in order to compare the figures on the two reports.  For
"DATA",727.1,7,1,39,0)
example, to verify data for the month of July, the user must first develop
"DATA",727.1,7,1,40,0)
a "Cumulative Totals" table for the month of July.  This is done by
"DATA",727.1,7,1,41,0)
subtracting the figures contained in the "Cumulative Totals" table of
"DATA",727.1,7,1,42,0)
June 30 from the figures contained in the "Cumulative Totals" table of
"DATA",727.1,7,1,43,0)
July 31 for the appropriate fiscal year.  (Again, this can be accomplished
"DATA",727.1,7,1,44,0)
manually, or with the aid of a spreadsheet application.)  The resulting
"DATA",727.1,7,1,45,0)
Cumulative Totals table can now be compared to your MOV Extract Audit
"DATA",727.1,7,1,46,0)
Report for the period July 1 to July 31.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,47,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,7,1,48,0)
When verifying the totals for discharge movements, you can directly
"DATA",727.1,7,1,49,0)
compare the total number of discharges shown in the last column for each
"DATA",727.1,7,1,50,0)
ward group on the MOV Extract Audit Report to the total discharges for
"DATA",727.1,7,1,51,0)
that same ward group on the Cumulative Totals table.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,52,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,7,1,53,0)
When verifying the total for transfer movements, the method of comparison
"DATA",727.1,7,1,54,0)
will depend on whether your site has NHCU wards.  The presence of NHCU
"DATA",727.1,7,1,55,0)
wards means that there may be ASIH movements which will not be reflected
"DATA",727.1,7,1,56,0)
in the total interward losses shown on the Cumulative Totals table.
"DATA",727.1,7,1,57,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,7,1,58,0)
   (1) If your site does not have NHCU wards, you can directly compare

Remember, if the facility has more than one Institution indentified in 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,75,0)
the WKLD DATA file (#64.1), a report for each must be generated.  If the
"DATA",727.1,12,1,76,0)
same Accession Area and procedures appear on more than one Institution's
"DATA",727.1,12,1,77,0)
workload statistics report, then the count from each for a given procedure
"DATA",727.1,12,1,78,0)
must be added together to compare with the figure on the LAB extract
"DATA",727.1,12,1,79,0)
audit report.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,80,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,81,0)
The workload statistics report can be many pages, so it is advisable to
"DATA",727.1,12,1,82,0)
limit it to a selected Accession Area for which data is being seen on the 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,83,0)
Laboratory (LAB) Extract Audit Report.  Be sure that the date range for
"DATA",727.1,12,1,84,0)
this workload statistics report is the same as the date range on the 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,85,0)
DSS LAB extract audit report.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,86,0)
   
"DATA",727.1,12,1,87,0)
It is also important to remember that these two reports will never show
"DATA",727.1,12,1,88,0)
a 100% correspondence in the totals reported.  This is because the 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,89,0)
workload statistics report is generated by procedure completion date,
"DATA",727.1,12,1,90,0)
whereas the LAB extract is essentially generated by specimen collection
"DATA",727.1,12,1,91,0)
date.  The LAB extract uses the specimen collection date because the
"DATA",727.1,12,1,92,0)
data extracted and sent to AAC must be correlated with patient encounter
"DATA",727.1,12,1,93,0)
data in order to produce the correct costing analysis.  And the specimen
"DATA",727.1,12,1,94,0)
collection date is always closely related to the encounter date.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,95,0)
 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,96,0)
In order to minimize the discrepancies between the two reports for
"DATA",727.1,12,1,97,0)
verification purposes, generate the reports for the full month.  Use
"DATA",727.1,12,1,98,0)
a start date of the first of the month, and an end date of the last day
"DATA",727.1,12,1,99,0)
of the month for both reports.  Narrowing the date range will cause
"DATA",727.1,12,1,100,0)
more and larger discrepancies to be seen.  However, there will be some
"DATA",727.1,12,1,101,0)
Lab procedures which always display differences in the totals shown
"DATA",727.1,12,1,102,0)
on these reports.  These procedures are those which frequently have
"DATA",727.1,12,1,103,0)
significant lag (i.e., greater than 30 days) between specimen collection
"DATA",727.1,12,1,104,0)
and test completion.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,105,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,106,0)
In order to be included in a DSS LAB extract, a lab procedure/test
"DATA",727.1,12,1,107,0)
must have an associated WKLD Code which satisfies at least one of the
"DATA",727.1,12,1,108,0)
following criteria:
"DATA",727.1,12,1,109,0)
   
"DATA",727.1,12,1,110,0)
  (1) The last 4 digits (after the decimal point) of the WKLD Code
"DATA",727.1,12,1,111,0)
      are "9999".
"DATA",727.1,12,1,112,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,113,0)
  (2) The first digit after the decimal of the WKLD Code is "8".
"DATA",727.1,12,1,114,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,115,0)
  (3) The WKLD Code is billable.  The BILLABLE PROCEDURE field
"DATA",727.1,12,1,116,0)
      (#4) for this WKLD Code entry in the WKLD CODE file (#64)
"DATA",727.1,12,1,117,0)
      is set to "YES".
"DATA",727.1,12,1,118,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,119,0)
  (4) The WKLD Code is marked as a DSS feeder key.  The DSS Feeder
"DATA",727.1,12,1,120,0)
      Key field (#14) for this WKLD Code entry in the WKLD CODE 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,121,0)
      file (#64) is set to "YES".
"DATA",727.1,12,1,122,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,12,1,123,0)
So there may be many more LMIP codes appearing on the workload statistics
"DATA",727.1,12,1,124,0)
report than on the extract audit report for a given Accession Area.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,125,0)
Verify extract data by comparing totals for each procedure/LMIP code
"DATA",727.1,12,1,126,0)
appearing on the extract audit report with the total for the same 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,127,0)
procedure/LMIP code on the Laboratory workload statistics report.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,128,0)
Also, verify that each procedure/LMIP code which satisfies criteria
"DATA",727.1,12,1,129,0)
(1) or (2) on the workload statistics report also appears on the LAB
"DATA",727.1,12,1,130,0)
extract audit report.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,131,0)
 
"DATA",727.1,12,1,132,0)
Remember, since the LAB extract is based on specimen collection date
"DATA",727.1,12,1,133,0)
rather than test completion (workload) date, it will not be unusual to
"DATA",727.1,12,1,134,0)
see small differences in the totals reported for a given procedure.
"DATA",727.1,12,1,135,0)
Procedures which consistently show a significantly lower total on the
"DATA",727.1,12,1,136,0)
LAB extract audit report than on the workload statistics report are
"DATA",727.1,12,1,137,0)
probably procedures which frequently have a large lag between date
"DATA",727.1,12,1,138,0)
of specimen collection and date of workload reporting.

one-to-one process.  However, the totals by procedure shown on the RAD 
"DATA",727.1,13,1,11,0)

"DATA",727.1,13,1,12,0)

"DATA",727.1,16,1,22,0)
Decision Support System (DSS) based on nationally recognized specialties
"DATA",727.1,16,1,23,0)
which are entries in the SPECIALTY file (#42.4).  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,24,0)
   
"DATA",727.1,16,1,25,0)
Therefore, the Treating Specialty Change (TRT) Extract Audit Report
"DATA",727.1,16,1,26,0)
displays both identifiers. The national specialty name (along with its
"DATA",727.1,16,1,27,0)
DSS code in parentheses) and the total number of losses to that specialty
"DATA",727.1,16,1,28,0)
are printed first.  There may be one or more Facility Treating Specialties
"DATA",727.1,16,1,29,0)
associated with a given national specialty.  The names of the associated
"DATA",727.1,16,1,30,0)
facility treating specialties are printed immediately underneath the
"DATA",727.1,16,1,31,0)
specialty name, and slightly indented.  (Only active facility treating
"DATA",727.1,16,1,32,0)
specialties are displayed.)
"DATA",727.1,16,1,33,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,34,0)
If there is more than one facility treating specialty associated with
"DATA",727.1,16,1,35,0)
the national specialty, then you must add together the losses shown on
"DATA",727.1,16,1,36,0)
the G&L Treating Specialty Report for each of those facility treating
"DATA",727.1,16,1,37,0)
specialties to arrive at the total number of losses shown on the TRT
"DATA",727.1,16,1,38,0)
Extract Audit Report for the specialty.
"DATA",727.1,16,1,39,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,40,0)
Both reports also show total losses by Service, so verification may be
"DATA",727.1,16,1,41,0)
accomplished with a lower degree of specificity.
"DATA",727.1,16,1,42,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,43,0)
Important note:
"DATA",727.1,16,1,44,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,45,0)
The total losses for all specialties seen on the TRT Extract Audit
"DATA",727.1,16,1,46,0)
Report ("Grand Total for all Services") may not reflect the total
"DATA",727.1,16,1,47,0)
number of records contained in the TRT extract.  This is because the
"DATA",727.1,16,1,48,0)
TRT extract includes provider-only changes, as well as true treating 
"DATA",727.1,16,1,49,0)
specialty changes.  In order to compare the TRT Extract Audit Report
"DATA",727.1,16,1,50,0)
to the G&L Treating Specialty Report, these provider-only changes
"DATA",727.1,16,1,51,0)
are being screened out of the total counts on the extract audit
"DATA",727.1,16,1,52,0)
report to the extent possible.  If your facility logs many of these
"DATA",727.1,16,1,53,0)
provider-only changes for its inpatients, you will see a significant
"DATA",727.1,16,1,54,0)
difference in the "Grand Total for all Services" and the total number
"DATA",727.1,16,1,55,0)
of records in the TRT extract.
"DATA",727.1,16,1,56,0)
  
"DATA",727.1,16,1,57,0)
The logic being used to screen out provider-only changes will
"DATA",727.1,16,1,58,0)
not be 100% effective if your facility has more than one active
"DATA",727.1,16,1,59,0)
facility treating specialty associated with a national specialty.
"DATA",727.1,16,1,60,0)
When this is the case, it is not possible to distinguish true
"DATA",727.1,16,1,61,0)
treating specialty changes from provider-only changes with the data
"DATA",727.1,16,1,62,0)
currently available in the extract record.  This will cause the
"DATA",727.1,16,1,63,0)
total losses for the specialty on the TRT Extract Audit Report
"DATA",727.1,16,1,64,0)
to be inflated.

verify data extracted for the DSS PAI Extract.  The PAF (PAS) Extract
"DATA",727.1,17,1,7,0)

records extracted from the PAF file (#45.9) for the date range.  That
"DATA",727.1,17,1,9,0)
total number could be verified by performing a simple VA FileMan

print from file #45.9.  The print template can be set up to display

simply the total number of records within a date range, rather than

showing data within each record.  Sort the records in the PAF file by
"DATA",727.1,17,1,13,0)
