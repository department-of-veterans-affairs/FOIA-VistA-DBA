 This emergency patch addresses one issue. The issue is pertaining to new
 behavior introduced in patch PRCA*4.5*188 which prevented the entry of
 some Fund codes based on the category of a bill.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
 1. HAM-0403-21604  OPTION CHANGE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    After installing patch PRCA*4.5*188, a site reported that they were
    unable to select the appropriate Fund code while using the New Bill
    (Enter) [PRCA BIL ENTER] option in the Billing [PRCA BILL] menu. They
    were receiving a warning message and being returned to the Fund prompt
    because the fund being entered did not match the fund in the code
    sheet table for the particular category of the bill. This behavior was
    introduced as a solution to a NOIS in patch PRCA*4.5*188. Although
    intended, it is not appropriate and must be removed to allow sites to
    choose the appropriate Fund code.  For more information, refer to
    patch PRCA*4.5*188.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PRCAFUT has been modified to remove the warning message and
    the fund code check against the code sheet table in order to allow
    the user to enter the appropriate funds as before patch PRCA*4.5*188.
    The other fixes introduced by patch PRCA*4.5*188 will remain.
