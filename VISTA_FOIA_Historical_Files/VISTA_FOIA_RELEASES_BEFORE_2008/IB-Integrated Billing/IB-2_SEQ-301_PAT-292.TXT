 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =====================
 1. HD0000000063080   MON-1299-50901  encounter not showing up on claims
                                      tracking
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The many problems identified in this NOIS and it's duplicates are a
    result of the Claims Tracker's inability to accept new Outpatient
    Encounter entries with the same date/time.  There are a variety of
    situations where different services/procedures will end up with the
    same episode dates.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Claims Tracker software was modified to accept a new entry with
    the same date/time as a previous entry.  New entries will only be
    prevented if the associated Outpatient Encounter is already associated
    with another existing claims tracking entry.  This change is effective
    with claims occurring on or after January 1, 2006.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 Routines IBTRKR4, IBTRKR41 and IBTUTL1 have been modified to allow the
 addition of a same date/time Outpatient Encounter entry to the CLAIMS
 TRACKING (#356) file.  The following options will now allow such entries 
 into Claims Tracking (for claims occurring on or after January 1, 2006): 
 Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP] and Manually 
 Add Opt. Encounters to Claims Tracking [IBT SUP MANUALLY QUE ENCTRS] 
 options as well as the Add Tracking Entry [IBTRE ADD TRACKING] protocol 
 from within the Claims Tracking Edit [IBT EDIT TRACKING ENTRY], the 
 Claims Tracking Edit [IBT EDIT IR TRACKING ENTRY], and the Claims 
 Tracking Edit [IBT EDIT HR TRACKING ENTRY] options.  Claims with the 
 same date/time occurring in 2005 or earlier will continue to be 
 processed by these options as they are now.
