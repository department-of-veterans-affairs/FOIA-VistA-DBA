Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
   
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines).  
    
   ****************************************************************
   
   
   This patch to DSS EXTRACTS v3.0 addresses the problem reported in
   NOIS POR-0298-52257 where an admission movement record was omitted 
   from the Admission (ADM) extract.
   
   The following DSS Extracts option is affected:
   
   Admissions Extract                       [ECXADM]
   
   Subroutine GET^ECXADM only searched the next 10 movement records
   following the admission movement record in the PATIENT MOVEMENT
   file (#405) in order to find the treating specialty change associated
   with the admission.  If the treating specialty record was not found,
   then the admission was not being added to the ADM extract file.  The 
   subroutine has been revised so that 100 movement records are searched,
   and the admission data is always added into the extract file.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  IRM should check
   the list of queued background jobs in TaskManager to be sure that the
   Admissions Extract job (START^ECXTRAC) has not been queued to run
   while this installation is taking place.
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*4):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*4.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
           Admissions Extract                     [ECXADM]
   
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
