Subject: CAPRI GUI UPDATE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 This informational patch has been released to announce an update to the
 CAPRI GUI executable.  This new GUI version provides updates for both VHA 
 and VBA.  Most of the changes in this version of the GUI are based on
 feedback directly from the field.
  
 This version of the GUI should replace all previous versions and should 
 be provided to all administrative and clinical staff who deal with C&P
 exams.  In addition, some VSO's, research, and Blind Rehab (VIST) staff
 also use CAPRI at VHA sites and must be provided the update if they are on
 a previous version.  
  
  
 CAPRI CPWM TRAINING
 ===================
 The C&P Worksheet Module (CPWM) is a component of CAPRI that's used
 primarily by clinical staff performing C&P exams.
  
 The Compensation and Pension Examination Program office (CPEP) has 
 created a CAPRI CPWM training website to provide you with information,
 video demonstrations and materials to support your understanding of the
 CAPRI Compensation and Pension templates.  This website can be accessed by
 either a link on the CPEP website, or by navigating there directly via the
 following address:
  
 "http://vaww.cpep.med.va.gov/capri"
  
 This web site will be periodically updated with new information, links and
 other materials to support the use of CAPRI CPWM at your site.  For
 specific issues, the CAPRI team can be reached through an Exchange message
 sent to "VHA OI SDD CAPRI".
