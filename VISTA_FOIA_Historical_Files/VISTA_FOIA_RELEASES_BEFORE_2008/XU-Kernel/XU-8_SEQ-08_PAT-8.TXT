Subject: XTER1/ZTER fix undefine error

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  =========================================================================
  Occasional errors have been reported in which an undefined error is
  generated while recording an error and others in which an undefined error
  is generated while using the error reporter.  These resulted from attempts
  to obtain the value of an entry in the ^TMP global with a final subscript
  of  0,0).  Similar code in both situations were related to the errors.
  This patch modifies both %ZTER (as ZTER) to correct the error while
  recording an error, and XTER1 to correct the error while displaying an
  error.

   Installation: 
   
  1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
       option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.  
    2. Answer NO to the question: 
       'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?' 
    3. From the 'Installion Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option 
       'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and verify that all routines 
       have the correct checksum.  
    4. From the 'Installion Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
       'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'XU*8.0*8' and proceed with
       install.
    5. After the patch has been loaded, the routine ZTER should be copied to
       the manager account and saved as %ZTER.
    6. The routines %ZTER and XTER1 may be included as part of a mapped
       routine set.  If this is the case, the mapped versions of %ZTER and
       XTER1 should be disabled until the mapped routines are reloaded.
