Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch insures that while navigating in the Claims Tracking Edit
 Option after the user switches patients while in the View Patient (VP)
 menu and returns to the list of the patients claims that the claims that
 are listed are actually the indicated patients claims. It also adds
 adjustment code CO 194 to the list of codes automatically processed, and
 modifies function call GETWNR^IBCNSMM1 to return only Part A or Part B
 Medicare plans like it is supposed to.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000151867    WRONG PATIENT'S CT ENTRIES DISPLAY
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  While in any of the Claims Tracking Edit Options if the user selects
  VP (View Pat. Ins.) and then selects CP (Change Patients) when the
  user returns to the Claims Tracking Menu the previous patients claims
  are shown with the new patients heading information. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Add code so that once the user exits the VP option the Claims list
  will be rebuilt with the new patients information.
  
 2) HD0000000159349     Add CO 194 to the list of adjustment
                        codes that meet auto-generation criteria
                        for MRA secondary claim.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Effective 10/2/06, a new adjustment code, CO 194, is going to be added
  to the adjustment code table.  This code needs to be added to the list
  of adjustment codes that meet auto-generation criteria for MRA 
  secondary claims. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Add CO 94 to the list of adjustment codes that are  automatically
  processed.
   
 3) HD0000000144624     Problem with $$GETWNR^IBCNSMM1 and IBCN
                        MEDICARE INSURANCE INTAKE
  
  Problem:
  --------
  While using the MEDICARE INSURANCE INTAKE option [IBCN MEDICARE
  INSURANCE INTAKE] a call is made to $$GET^IBCNSMM1 which is
  supposed to return information pertaining to Medicare Part A and
  Medicare Part B plans, but under certain circumstances it will
  return Railroad Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B information. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Before returning the Medicare information, validate that the
  information is strictly Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B.
