Subject: AMIS REPORT - NON-VA PHARMACY PATIENT STATUS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Since the release of patch PSO*7*146, Transitional Pharmacy Benefits (TPB),
 there has been an increase in the number of prescriptions which have a
 pharmacy patient status of Non-VA. Pharmacy's current AMIS Report option [PSO
 AMIS] and Daily AMIS Report option [PSO DAILY AMIS] do not include Non-VA
 prescriptions in any of their counts. 
 
 This patch will modify the Compile AMIS Data (NIGHT JOB) option [PSO AMIS
 COMPILE] and the Recompile AMIS Data option [PSO AMIS RECOMPILE] to include
 the Non-VA prescription counts in a new NVA field (#17) in the DIVISION
 multiple (#59.11) of the OUTPATIENT AMIS DATA file (#59.1). Pharmacy's AMIS
 Report option [PSO AMIS] and Daily AMIS Report option [PSO DAILY AMIS] will be
 modified to display this field in a new NVA column.
  
 If you install this patch and wish to include all past prescriptions with a
 Patient Status of Non-VA for past dates, you must run the Recompile AMIS Data
 option [PSO AMIS RECOMPILE].
  
 Keep in mind that if you ran the AMIS report in the past, the counts will be
 different when you re-run the report for that past date, since the compile
 will now include prescriptions with a pharmacy patient status of Non-VA. Also
 note that the recompile is system intensive and should be run after hours.

     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
