Subject: ORDER CHECK OVERRIDES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains enhancements in support of drug-drug interaction
 order check exclusions. In addition, the National Drug File patch PSN*4*70
 is required to support this function. When both patches are installed,
 drug-drug interactions will be excluded for specifically identified drugs.
 The list of drugs and VA products flagged for exclusion can be found using
 the VA Products Excluded from Drug-Drug Interactions [PSNEXMPT] option and
 the Local Drugs Excluded from Drug-Drug Interactions [PSNODDI] option
 contained on the National Drug File Reports Menu [PSNSUBM] option within
 National Drug File V. 4.0.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
 install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy V 7.0 users are on the system
 or when Outpatient orders are being entered and signed through Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) V 1.0.  Installation will take no longer than 5
 minutes.  Suggested time to install: During non-peak requirement hours for
 CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy users.  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*144) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*144.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
