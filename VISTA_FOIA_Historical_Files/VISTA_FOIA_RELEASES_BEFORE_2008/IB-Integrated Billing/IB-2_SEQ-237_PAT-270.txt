Subject: REASONABLE CHARGES 2.1

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Reasonable Charges version 2.1 is a charge update to the existing
 Reasonable Charges billed to Third Party Payers.  The Integrated Billing
 Charge Master, and Bill/Claims functionality have been modified to support
 the requirements of billing with Reasonable Charges v2.1.
                 
 The primary update with this patch is to the charges, which will be 
 implemented when the new RC v2.1 charges are uploaded.
                
 Effective Date of Reasonable Charges v2.1 is 04/15/04.  
              
 The Reasonable Charge v2.0 loaded on your system will be inactivated with 
 an inactivation date of 04/14/04 when this patch is installed.
                                      
 BUNDLED PROCEDURE CODES
 -----------------------
 There was a set of procedures exported with RC v2.0 where the separate
 technical procedure code and professional procedure code components
 should be billed rather than the global procedure.  This list has been
 updated.  
                
 Procedure 93786 has been added as a technical component of the global 
 procedure 93784.
                       
 The updated complete list of procedures split:
                      
         Global           Technical           Professional
         ------           ---------           ------------
         93000            93005               93010
         93015            93017               93016 & 93018
         93040            93041               93042
         93224            93225 & 93226       93227
         93230            93231 & 93232       93233
         93235            93236               93237
         93268            93270 & 93271       93272
         93720            93721               93722
         93784            93786 & 93788       93790
         94014            94015               94016
                   
 At Provider Based sites, the global procedure should not be billed. The 
 technical component procedure(s) should be billed on the UB-92, and the 
 professional component procedure(s) should be billed on the HCFA 1500.
                    
 At Non-Provider Based (Freestanding) sites, if both the technical and 
 professional components are preformed, then the global procedure should 
 be billed.
  
 PRESCRIPTION BILLING
 --------------------
 When a prescription is billed, the procedure in the IB Site Parameter 
 Default Rx Refill CPT field is automatically added to the bill.  With RC 
 v2.1, many of the procedures that could be used as this default Rx 
 procedure now have charges of their own.  This would result in both the 
 $45 for the prescription, and the additional charge for the procedure, 
 which is incorrect.  Therefore, procedures assigned to a bill that meet 
 the following criteria will not receive their RC charge:
  
 -  The bill has Prescriptions assigned.
 -  The procedure is the IB Site Parameter Default Rx Refill CPT
 -  The procedure was not transferred from PCE (Patient Care Encounter).
             
 Therefore, billing for prescriptions should not change.  The prescription 
 will be billed the $45, regardless of the procedure used to identify the 
 prescription on the bill.
  
 MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURE DISCOUNT
 ------------------------------------
 If multiple surgical procedures from a single encounter are assigned to 
 a bill, then a discount is applied to the Reasonable Charges facility 
 charges.
            
 The list of procedures the Multiple Surgical Procedure Discount applies 
 too has been changed slightly with v2.1.  This is the complete list of 
 procedures the discount is applied to in RC v2.1.

 PRIMARY/SECONDARY BUNDLED DISCOUNT
 ----------------------------------
 There are certain sets of procedures that are defined as primary and 
 secondary.  If both are performed, then the cost of the secondary 
 procedure is bundled into the cost of the primary procedure.  If only 
 primary or only secondary are performed, then the full cost is billed.  
 Beginning with RC v2.0, both primary and secondary procedures are 
 exported with a full charge.  Therefore, if both primary and secondary 
 procedures are performed during an encounter, then the charges of each 
 will be discounted to equal the total of the primary charge.
                     
 The list of Primary/Secondary Bundled procedures has been changed 
 slightly with v2.1.  This is the complete list of procedures the 
 discount is applied to in RC v2.1.

 Technical Description
 =====================
 This patch exports 7 routines, and one is the post-init (IBYPSB).
                 
 The post init will complete the following:
                               
 1.  Inactivate all existing Reasonable Charges defined in the Charge 
     Master.  Reasonable Charges v2.0 will be inactivated on 04/14/04.
                               
 The following is an example of the post-init portion of the installation.  
               
     Reasonable Charges v2.1 Post-Install .....

      ------------------------------
      Follow the instructions below.
                                
                   
 ============== Reasonable Charges v2.1 Upload Instructions ==============
           
 After patch installation, the RC v2.1 (Reasonable Charges v2.1) charges
 for each division billed at a site will need to be loaded into the Charge
 Master.  The charges for each Division will require approximately
 1.1-1.3Mb of disk space.
                    
                        
 Files Required for Upload:
 ==========================
 The charge files are available on the following CIO Field Offices' 
 Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability to 
 retrieve the files (ASCII).

 Upload Instructions:
 ====================
                 
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v2.1 Host Files in ASCII format (see 
 previous section).
                       
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
 print the Billing Region report to find which Billing Regions and
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions
 that will need new charges loaded.
                   
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option
 to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
 care is billed at your site.  Steps 4-7
                
 Step 4:  Select 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
 ---------------------------------------
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
 for individual Divisions.
            
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 2.1
                 
   - If there exists any charges previously calculated for a division,
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
     Select Yes - delete the previously calculated charges.
                     
   - If there exists any previously loaded host files for an RC version,
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
     Select Yes - only if the files are not for the correct version.  
             
   - When loading Reasonable Charges v2.1, the IBRC0404x.TXT files may be
     used multiple times without reloading.  
     Select No - if the files are IBRC0404x.TXT and you are loading
     RC v2.1
                 
   - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
     This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing
     Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
     selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
              
 Step 5: Select 3 - Check Data Validity
 --------------------------------------
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for
 the first division loaded.  If the resulting report has any Line Data
 Errors, then check that the latest version of CPT and DRG has been
 installed.
                
 Step 6: Select 4 - Load into Charge Master
 ------------------------------------------
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
                
 It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
 upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
 another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
 complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the 
 charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded 
 serially.  
               
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report list determined previously.
                   
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, selection 2, to calculate RC v2.1 charges for a division
 o  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
 have changed it's division number, then extra care is needed to ensure
 the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide
 some additional information about the upload.
               
                         
 ================ Reasonable Charges v2.1 Upload Examples ================

             at your site.  Possible Selections:               
                    1         Reasonable Charges version 1.0
                    1.1       Reasonable Charges version 1.1

                    2.1       Reasonable Charges version 2.1
                      
   2         Assign Charge Set
             Assign or re-assign the charges calculated to the correct
             Charge Sets.  This option is only needed if the charges 
             calculated are assigned to a Division number in the new 
             version that is different than the Division number used in
             previous versions of RC.
                       
   3         Check Data Validity
             Runs through the load into the Charge Master without
             actually making any changes and reports any problems found.
                       
   4         Load into Charge Master
             Load the updated charges into the Charge Master for the site    
             requested.
                   
   5         Delete XTMP files
             Deletes all temporary files created for the upload process.
             This selection is optional, all temporary files are deleted
             automatically after 2 days.
                      
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 o  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site or a site that may have 
 changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure the set 
 up of the Charge Master is correct.  Following sections provide some 
 additional information about the upload.
