Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*287 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 Patch LR*5.2*287 corrects a defect reported in NOIS ALB-0602-52815.
 Duplicate comments were not being stored with results when verifying
 automated instrument or load work list data. This patch will allow the
 site to specify on a load/work list basis whether duplicate comments
 will be stored with lab results when verifying the accession.
  
 A new field STORE DUPLICATE COMMENTS (#2.2) in PROFILE multiple (#68.23)
 of file LOAD/WORK LIST (#68.2) will determine if duplicate comments are
 stored when processing results from a load/work list. When the Laboratory
 result verifying software is processing comments associated with a
 load/work list result, this field determines how duplicate comments are
 processed. If set to "NO" (default if no value) then a comment that
 matches a previously stored comment will not be stored with the result.
 If set to "YES" then the duplicate check is not performed and the comment
 is stored with the results irregardless if the comment already exists.
 Setting it to "YES" will allow the handling of multiple line comments which
 contain the same comment more than once and are still clinically 
 significant.
  
 Edit the default parameters Load/Work list. [LRLLE DFT] option has been
 modified to allow configuring this field.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory

   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that

   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*287.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
       Note: KIDS will disable the following options during patch
       installation:
          Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR]
          Enter/verify data (Work list) [LRVRW]
          Enter/verify data (Load list) [LRVRW2]
          Edit the default parameters Load/Work list. [LRLLE DFT]
  
   7. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
 NOTE: Routine LR287 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
