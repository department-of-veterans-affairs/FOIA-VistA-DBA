Subject: CLINICAL REMINDERS AND DIALOGS FOR IHD QUERI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch releases two new NATIONAL reminders and dialogs required for the
 IHD QUERI project.  They will be placed in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file 
 (#811.8).
            VA-IHD ELEVATED LDL 
            VA-IHD LIPID PROFILE
  
 The IHD clinical reminders in this patch have been developed by the IHD
 QUERI Clinical Reminders Project and the Office of Information (OI) System 
 Design & Development (SDD) Health Data Systems group. The reminders contain 
 provider interventions for lipid management of patients with known
 Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD).  
  
 The goal of the National IHD Clinical Reminders Project is to develop and 
 nationally distribute clinical reminders that can be used by providers
 to facilitate lipid management of patients with Ischemic Heart Disease
 (IHD) and can help increase adherence to national clinical practice
 guidelines. 
  
 This patch also contains changes that have been made to the Patient Cohort 
 Logic, to help resolve some problems identified by test sites:
  
 1.  The reminder term logic will first find the most recent finding and
 then apply the Effective Period and Condition.  This solves the problem
 where two LDLs have been done, one 6 months ago with a value > 120, and
 the second LDL done with a different test with a value < 120. The most 
 recent LDL finding within a reminder term will be now be used to determine
 true or false value, rather than the most recent finding found with a 
 true condition.
  
 2.  Functions can now be used in the Patient Cohort Logic. A function 
 called the "Most Recent Date" (MRD) function will return the most recent
 date from a list of finding items.  The function will look something like
 the following:  MRD(F1,F2,F3).
  
 Changes to managing nationally distributed reminders and dialogs:
 All nationally distributed reminder dialogs will now be distributed with a 
 VA- prefix, and flagged as national. This applies to reminder dialogs,
 dialog groups, and dialog elements. The only field that will be editable
 in the national reminder dialog is the finding item in the dialog group 
 and dialog elements. Any additional changes require 1) copying the dialog
 to a local reminder dialog and 2) copy and replace functionality.
  
 A redistribution of the national reminder dialog will 1) save the dialog
 element finding items defined on your system, 2) install the dialog
 components, replacing the old dialog components, and 3) replace the local
 finding item values into the dialog components. Reminder Terms will not be
 overridden.  If the reminder term already exists on your system, no added
 updates are made.
  
 The current dialog management has been modified to allow selection of 
 elements anywhere in the structure and editing of the Finding Item
 and Additional Findings fields.
  
 Documentation:
 ==============
  
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by
  this patch is available in a new Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) Clinical 
  Reminders Project PXMR*1.5*8 Installation and Setup Guide.
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
  may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
  follows:
   
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
   
  This documentation will be in the form of an Adobe Acrobat file: 
  PXRMIG-P8.PDF (IHD Installation and Setup Guide). The documentation
  can also be found on the System Design and Development Web page:
  (http://vista.med.va.gov/vdl/).  Also on the /vdl/ web page will be a
  Clinician Reference Guide for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD_Brochure.pdf).
