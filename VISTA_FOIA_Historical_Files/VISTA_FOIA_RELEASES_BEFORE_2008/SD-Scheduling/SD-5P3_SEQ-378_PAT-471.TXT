 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 HD113373  Institution missing in file 409.3
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When making a Wait List entry directly following dispositioning a Wait
    List entry in Appointment Management, fields Institution (field #2)
    and Wait List Type (field #4) will be null in file #409.3.  This is
    due to variables SDWLIN and SDWLTY not killed during the Disposition
    process when making an appointment against an open Wait List entry.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine SDWLEVAL to use kill exit path when dispositioning
    an open Wait List entry while making an appointment.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:
 ========================
 This patch was created with Kernel V8 KIDS and should be installed into 
 your production UCI.  It can be installed anytime, but because some

 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
    INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 2. From the Installation menu, on the Kernel Installation and 
    Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, you may elect to use the following
    options (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*471):
  
         a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
             message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.)
  
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

         entries having a null institution (INST), wait list type
         (Type) or EWL type/location (Team,Postn,Srv/Spec,Clinic).

 174   MACISAAC,STEPHEN F                                INST,Type/++
  
 110   VERSION,THREE                                     INST,Type
      ** WAIT LIST TYPE corrected to value: 3 (SERV/SPCLTY)
  
 TOTAL null field error EWL entries: 20
  
 ++ Missing Wait List Type and corresponding field entry (TEAM,
      POSITION,SERVICE/SPECIALTY,CLINIC). Correct corresponding
      field entries and running report again will correct Wait 
      List Type field
  
 ** End of Report **
  
     d.  Fileman can be used to correct the null fields (Institution or 
         Wait List Type "pointed to" field 5-8:  Team, Position, 
         Serv/Specialty or Clinic in the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3) as
         the correct field information is provided. This can ONLY be
         determined by the site and not programmatically corrected. 
  
        ** If a field 5-8 has a value, but field 4 points (1-4) to the 
           incorrect piece 5-8 set, the routine will correct Field 4 to
           point to the correct service location field (5-8).
  
        **If Wait List Type (field 4) is null and there is no location
          field defined (5-8) the site will need to correct location
          field 5-8 with the proper value, and re-running the
          report will correct the null Wait List Type. You will see an
          '/++' appended to the Null Field entry: Type, and an  
          explanation at the bottom of the report:
           ++ Missing Wait List Type and corresponding field entry
              (TEAM,POSITION,SERVICE/SPECIALTY,CLINIC). 
              Correct corresponding field entries and running report
              again will correct Wait List Type field.
  
        **If Wait List Type (field 4) is null AND there is a location 
          field defined (5-8) the routine will correct Field 4 to point to
          the defined service location field (5-8) and a note will be 
          included on report as follows:
           ** WAIT LIST TYPE corrected to value: 3 (SERV/SPCLTY)
