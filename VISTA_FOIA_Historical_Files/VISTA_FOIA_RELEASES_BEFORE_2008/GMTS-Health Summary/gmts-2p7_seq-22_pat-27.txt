Subject: Y2K COMPLIANCE CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 Routines included within this patch were changed to bring them into
 compliance with requirements issued by the VISTA Year 2000 Project
 Office.  VISTA Year 2000 Guildelines Document was issued October 1997.
 This document outlines the requirements for the VISTA software.
   
 ONLY Year 2000 & Leap Year issues are addressed by this patch.
 
 The only change necessary for Health Summary was to display the patient's 
 date of birth using a four digit year instead of a two digit year. This 
 change required reformatting the patient header displayed on each page of 
 the Health Summary.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1. Routines:  GMTSU, GMTSUP
 Printing of the patient's date of birth was changed from a two digit
 year to a four digit year. A new entry point, REGDT4, was added to
 GMTSU. The new entry point is now used to format the date of birth with
 a four digit year. The header where the date of birth is printed was
 changed to allow for the four digit year. The header contains the
 patient's name, social security number, ward, room-bed, and date of
 birth. The ward and room-bed is printed only if it is available. In the
 original version of the routine, if the patient has a long name it
 could extend into the ward room-bed field or the ward room-bed could
 extend into the date of birth. A calculation was added to check all the
 lengths. If any field overlaps then the ward and room-bed are printed on
 a second line. The header calculation was originally made in GMTSUP
 every time a new page was called for. This was unnecessary work, it only
 needs to change when the patient changes.  The header calculation was
 moved into DEM^GMTSU so it is done once per patient. The results of the
 calculation is stored in the local array GMTSPHDR so that GMTSUP can
 use it for printing.
 
 2. Routines:  GMTSADHC, GMTSDVR, GMTSPL
 The new variable, GMTSPHDR introduced above, would remain defined
 unless it was newed or killed. It was added to the newed list in each
 of these routines.
