 This patch modifies these two routines to allow printing of new 
 vitals/measurements included in version 4 of the Vitals Package.
 The new vital signs include circumference/girth, pulse oximetry,
 central venous pressure, and the patient's body mass index (BMI)
 value.  The BMI is displayed if weight is selected.
  
 This patch can be installed with version 3 or version 4 of Vitals.
 If it is installed with version 3 you will not see any changes. If
 installed with version 4 you will be allowed to select the new 
 vitals/measurements.
