Subject: New Race and Ethnicity Fields

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 The Office of Management and Budget has issued new standards for 
 capturing race and ethnicity. The new standard supports multiple answers 
 for Race and Ethnicity stored in two new fields in the Patient file. In 
 this patch the references to the old race value in Text Integration 
 Utility (TIU) are revised to support the new race and ethnicity fields. 
  
 1.      TIU Data Objects
 a.    Race
 The existing Race object was revised to support the new race field. If a 
 new race entry exists, the new race information will display as the 
 patient object. A comma and one space separate multiple race entries.
 Example:
 NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER, WHITE
 If there are no new race entries then the "old" race entry will display 
 as the data object. If the patient has no data entered defining race then 
 "RACE UNKNOWN" will display.
 b.   Ethnicity
 A new data object is created called PATIENT ETHNICITY. If an ethnicity 
 entry exists, the ethnicity information will display as the data object. 
 A comma and one space separate multiple ethnicity entries 
 Example:
 NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO, DECLINED TO ANSWER
 If there is no Ethnicity entry then "ETHNICITY UNKNOWN" will display.
  
 2.      Routine TIULV Changes
 TIULV was revised to receive Race as a multiple from the DEM^VADPT 
 routine.  TIULV is called by other TIU routines to receive the Race entry 
 for the selected patient. Race is saved in the VADM variable. If there 
 are no new race entries then the "old" race entry will be saved in the 
 VADM variable.
  
 3.      Routine TIULD Changes
 TIULD calls the TIULV routine to receive the Race entry for the selected 
 patient. TIULD was revised to display race as a multiple from the 
 Transcriptionist menu when a discharge summary is being associated with a 
 patient visit. 
  
 4.      Routine TIUCHLP Changes
 TIUCHLP calls the TIULV routine to receive the Race entry for the 
 selected patient. In processing an alert for an upload filing error the 
 patients' demographics display.  The TIUCHLP routine is called when 
 handling upload errors. TIUCHLP was revised to display Race as a multiple.
  
 5. Routine TIUPRDS2 Changes
 HEADER^TIUPRDS2 prints the header of discharge summaries. Previously, 
 four characters of race were displayed on the header. It was decided that 
 four characters would not accurately represent a patient's race therefore 
 race was removed from the header of the print out.
  
 TIUPS148 is a new post-install routine that defines the 'PATIENT 
 ETHNICITY' TIU data object in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (8925.1). 
 The TIUPS148 routine runs during install and if the TIU data object is 
 defined successfully a message will appear during installation. Example:
  
 Build Distribution Date: Nov 04, 2002
                                   
 TIU*1.0*148

  NO Install Message sent
  
  
 IMPORTANT   Once it has been determined that the PATIENT ETHNICITY data 
 object has been successfully created the TIUPS148 routine can be deleted.
 If the new TIU object is not created during installation the TIUPS148 
 routine can be run from the programmer prompt.

 After the installation of this patch it is suggested that the person 
 installing this patch (or a designee) check to ensure that the PATIENT 
 ETHNICITY data object is created in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file. 
 This can be done from the Create Objects option in the Manager Document 
 Definition Menu. PATIENT ETHNICITY should display in alphabetical order 
 with the other objects.

 64     PATIENT HEIGHT                    A
  
  
 If a 'PATIENT ETHNICITY' TIU data object already exist on your system 
 (which is highly unlikely since the ethnicity field is new) the Object 
 Method field in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file will be overwritten by 
 the National Object Method for the PATIENT ETHNICITY data object.
  
 There are no NOIS calls associated with this patch.
