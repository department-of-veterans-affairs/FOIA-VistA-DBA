Description: 
============

 This patch corrects some issues in error-processing of Inter-facility 
 Consults.  
  
 The changes include:
  
 1) IFC requests with patient info errors at the consulting site will
 continue to re-transmit to the consulting facility after 5 tries. A mail
 message reporting the error will be sent to the IFC CLIN ERRORS group at
 the consulting site every 8 transmissions or approximately every 24 hours.
  
 2) A new parameter (GMRC IFC ALERT IMMED ON PT ERR) can be set to YES, 
 which will notify the IFC CLIN ERRORS mail group at the sending facility 
 immediately if a patient information error occurs at the consulting
 facility.
  
 3) A new parameter (GMRC IFC SKIP WEEKEND RE-TRANS) can be set to YES, 
 which will prevent the IFC Background job from re-transmitting requests 
 with Unknown Patient errors Local or unknown MPI identifiers errors to the
 consulting facility on Saturday or Sunday.
  
 4) The mail messages sent to the IFC PATIENT ERROR MESSAGES mail group 
 will now include the type of error and the service or procedure being 
 requested in the body of the message. The text of the mail messages has
 also been enhanced to further facilitate finding the follow-up action for
 resolution in the documentation.
  
 5) A new report option, Print All Incomplete IFC Transactions [GMRC IFC
 INC RPT] will print a report of all incomplete IFC transactions sorted by 
 consult number.
  
 6) A new option, Edit IFC Processing Parameters [GMRC IFC PARAMETER EDIT] 
 is included that will allow the editing of the two new parameters as well 
 as the parameter controlling the number of days to retain completed IFC 
 transactions. 
  
 7) The IFC Transaction Report has been modified to exclude the HL7 
 Message Status from the display. Any IFC error associated with the 
 transaction will now display in the first list manager screen of the 
 report.
