Subject: PUT DOD REPORTS INTO CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch adds entries to the OE/RR Reports file for several
  DOD reports.
   
  These reports were to go out with the last GUI patch
  (OR*3.0*132), but got missed.  The reports are as follows:
  
  NUMBER: 1102     ORRPW DOD
   DESCRIPTIVE TEXT: Dept. of Defense Reports
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD LAB
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD PHARM ALL OUT
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD RAD REPORT
  
  NUMBER: 1104     ORRPW DOD LAB
   DESCRIPTIVE TEXT: Laboratory
     ITEM: ORRPW LAB ORDERS
     ITEM: ORRPW LAB CHEM
     ITEM: ORRPW LAB SP
     ITEM: ORRPW LAB MICRO
  
 NUMBER: 1105      ORRPW DOD PHARM ALL OUT
   
 NUMBER: 1106      ORRPW DOD RAD REPORT
  
 WARNING: If you have any local entries in entries 1102, 1104, 1105
 or 1106 in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24), that you want to keep,
 move them to an internal number <1000.  This patch will delete 
 these entry numbers before proceeding with the install.
  
 In addition to these new reports some updates are being made to the
 file definitions for the following reports:
  
   1078  ORRPW PHARMACY ACT OUT     Active Outpatient RX
   1079  ORRPW PHARMACY ALL OUT     All Outpatient RX
   1101  ORRPW ADT VISITS           Visits / Admissions
  
 Note:  As part of this installation the report ORRPW DOD is added
 to the package level parameter ORWRP REPORT LIST.  You may want to
 also add this parameter value to your system level parameters and
 any user parameters.  This is what the Package level values look
 like after patch installation:
      Sequence                             Value
