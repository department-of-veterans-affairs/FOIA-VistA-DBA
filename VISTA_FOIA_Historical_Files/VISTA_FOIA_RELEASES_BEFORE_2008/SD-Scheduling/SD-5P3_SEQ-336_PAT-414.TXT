Subject: WAIT LIST OVERDUE REPORT PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct a problem with the Wait List Overdue report.
 Additionally, when canceling an appointment via Appointment Management
 and selecting Appointment Cancelled by Clinic, when applicable, a
 message should display on the screen indicating there are patients on
 the Wait List waiting for an appointment in the clinic.  The message
 is properly displayed when selecting a clinic upon entering Appointment
 Management.  However, when selecting a patient name to enter Appointment
 Management, canceling an appointment and selecting Appointment Cancelled 
 by Clinic, the message does not display when applicable.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1)  HD64169/CTX-0904-70134C   APPT W/L OVERDUE REPORT
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the Wait List Overdue report for the clinics and
     selecting specific clinics, the report prints all the clinics
     for the selected institution, not just the clinic specified.
    
     Also, the clinic or service/specialty name on the header of the
     report may not always be the correct name.
  
     When selecting a printer for the report, the report prints on the 
     screen and not the printer. Also, corrected the page overflow
     errors when selecting to print directly to a printer.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine SDWLROS to check for selected clinics by correcting 
     the code preventing the selected clinic to display only.
  
     Modify routines SDWLROS and SDWLROF to display the correct clinic
     or service/specialty name in the header.
  
     Modify SDWLQOF to assign the selected printer when printing and 
     unassign when printing is completed.
  
  
 2)  HD63840/HWH-0304-42659   QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EWL
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When canceling an appointment via Appointment Management and
     selecting Appointment Cancelled by Clinic, when applicable, a
     message should display on the screen: "There are patients on
     the Wait List waiting for an Appointment in this Clinic."  The message
     properly displays when selecting a clinic upon entering Appointment
     Management.  However, when selecting a patient name to enter
     Appointment Management, canceling an appointment and selecting
     Appointment Cancelled by Clinic, the message does not display when
     applicable.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     In order to resolve this issue, several minor changes will be made
     to routine SDAMC to insure the message is always displayed when
     applicable, regardless of how a user enters Appointment Management.
