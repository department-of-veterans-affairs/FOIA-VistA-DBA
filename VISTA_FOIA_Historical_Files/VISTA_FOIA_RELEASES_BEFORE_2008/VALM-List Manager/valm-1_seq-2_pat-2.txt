Subject: Removal of Resource Usage Monitor Code

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Description:
 ===========
  
 The Capacity Management (CM) development team is removing obsolete
 references to the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) code.  CM has deemed that
 these references are no longer necessary in order to monitor system
 resource consumption.  The existing code in these routines that extracted
 the system workload data will now be located within Kernel's menu manager
 routines.
  
  
 Routine Summary:
 ===============
  
 The following is a list of the routine(s) included within this patch.  The
 second line of each routine now looks like:

 Installation:
 ============
  
 The installation of this patch requires that users be off the system.
 Installation of this patch should not take longer than 10-15 minutes.
  
        
   1.   If you are either a 'DSM for OpenVMS' or 'MSM-DOS' site, you will
        need to review your mapped routines sets.  You will need to disable
        mapping for the VALMXQ02 and VALMXQ15 routines.
        
        
   2.   Load the patch distribution onto your system by following these
        instructions:
        
        Enter 'X' at the 'Select MESSAGE Action: IGNORE//' (or DELETE//)
        mail prompt and select the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.
        
   3.   From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' (KIDS) menu,
        select the 'Installation' menu.
        
  
   4.   You may now elect to use the following options: 
  
              When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter VALM*1.0*2
                                                        ==========
  
        a.    Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this release.  It will
              NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
        b.    Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
              release is installed.  It compares all components of the
              release (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
              
        c.    Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
  
  
   5.   Use the 'Install Package(s)' option and select the package
        VALM*1.0*2.
        ==========
   
   
   6.   When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols?', you can respond with NO.
  
        
   7.   If any routines were unmapped as part of Step 1, the mapped set
        should be rebuilt, by using the procedures appropriate to your
        particular operating system, to incorporate any routine changes.
