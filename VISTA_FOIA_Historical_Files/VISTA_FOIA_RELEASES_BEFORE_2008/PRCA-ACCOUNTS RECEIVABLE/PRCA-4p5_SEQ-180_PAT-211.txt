 **********************************************************************
  
 A site reported that there have been three issues found since the install
 of PRCA*4.5*203. The first issue is that the Revenue Source Codes for  
 Pharmacy bills do not print and it appears to happen when the category is 
 RX CO-PAYMENT/NSC VET. The second issue indicates that Pharmacy First Party 
 bills are being deposited into a fund of 5287.3 while the patch description
 in PRCA*4.5*203 states that the New Point Accounts for pharmacy bill 
 should be 5287.1. The third issue is that the old closed receipts (FY03)
 prior to the installation of PRCA*4.5*203 are reporting funds for the New
 Point Accounts and they print in the 215 report.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
 1.  UNY-1103-10188     New Point Account Issues
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Revenue Source code for Pharmacy bills do not print and the
     incorrect fund of 5287.3 is used instead of 5287.1.  These issues
     were found after the installation of the patch  PRCA*4.5*203, which
     was associated with the creation of new points account.
  
     Another issue found was in the 215 report in menu option RECEIPTS
     PROCESSING. The closed accounts processed before the creation of the 
     New Point accounts are including the charges for the new point accounts
     due to the fact that the report was based on current date and not the 
     processed date.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine PRCASER to call a listing of the categories and
     associated funds instead of the presence of hard code for the fund of 
     5287.3 in the FUND field (#203) in Accounts Receivable file (#430).
     This fix will resolve the problems with the print for the Revenue
     Source code as well as the deposits to the incorrect fund for Pharmacy
     bills.
  
     Also modified routines RCDPR215 and RCXFMSUF to correct the fund
     that prints on the 215 report that was based on the current date
     to the processed date of the receipt.
     
     An environment check routine will be used to check if site has a
     CoreFLS version of software and recommend not to install this patch
     unless an accompanying update is made to the AR-CoreFLS software
     immediately after installation of this patch.
