Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
   avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
   of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
   Issue 1:  It was reported in NOIS MAC-1102-60691 that the Local
   Integration Control Number (ICN) count doesn't accurately reflect
   the number of Local ICNs.  It was found that the 'AICNL'
   cross-reference isn't always being cleaned up via FileMan, resulting
   in incorrect totals when counting entries in the cross-reference.  
   The Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
   will check the 'AICNL' cross reference to be sure it should be set and
   cleanup those that shouldn't be set. Routine MPIFRES will address
   this issue.
  
   Issue 2:  It was reported in NOIS BHS-1102-11158 that there are times
   during the real-time connection with the Master Patient Index (MPI) the
   user is displayed text stating that the patient should not be sent to
   the MPI when the patient should be sent to the MPI for ICN assignment.
   This is being fixed in routine MPIFQ0.
  
   Issue 3:  It was report in NOIS OKL-1202-70502 that a hard error had 
   occured during the running of the AUTO CHANGE CMOR NIGHT JOB [MPIF CMOR 
   REQUEST AUTO JOB].  This is being fixed in routine MPIFREQ.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Via TaskMan, unschedule the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] and the AUTO CHANGE CMOR 
        NIGHT JOB [MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB] if it is scheduled to run
        during installation of this patch.
  
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*26.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
   10.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Inactivate Patient from MPI             [MPIF PAT INACT]
         Single Patient Initialization to MPI    [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]
         Display Only Query              [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] 
         Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
         10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
         Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
         Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
         Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
    
      
   11.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
  
  
   12.  Reschedule, via TaskMan, the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] and AUTO CHANGE CMOR NIGHT 
        JOB [MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB] if unscheduled in step 4.
