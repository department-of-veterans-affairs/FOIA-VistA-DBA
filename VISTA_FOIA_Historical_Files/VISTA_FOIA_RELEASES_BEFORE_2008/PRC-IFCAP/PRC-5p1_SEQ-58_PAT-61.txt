Description:
============

 ********************************** IRM NOTE **********************************
 Install this patch within the usual time frame. Your site will receive an
 "Action Request" from the CoreFLS Project Office, which contains instructions
 about assigning the security key. 
  
 You may assign the security key at any time prior to receiving the
 Action Request.
 ******************************************************************************
  
 This patch is in support of a site's preparatory steps for CoreFLS
 deployment. A new menu, Generic Inventory Data Cleansing Reports [PRCL
 GENERIC INVENTORY], is added to the CoreFLS Data Cleansing [PRCL COREFLS
 DATA CLEANSING] menu as part of the installation of this patch. This new
 menu contains the following report options:
  
     Summary Generic Inventory Point Report [PRCL GEN. INV. POINT RPT - SUM]
     Detailed Generic Inventory Point Report [PRCL GEN. INV. POINT RPT - DET]
     Summary Generic Inventory Item Report [PRCL GEN. INV. ITEM RPT - SUM]
     Detailed Generic Inventory Item Report [PRCL GEN. INV. ITEM RPT - DET]
     Missing Inventory Point or 'B' x-ref [PRCL MISSING INV. POINT RPT]
     Secondary Inventory Points w/more than one primary [PRCL SECONDARY INV.
         POINT RPT]
  
 The reports in the Generic Inventory Data Cleansing Reports menu do not
 require a separate compile to run, unlike the Vendor Data
 Cleansing Reports [PRCL VENDOR]. The Data Cleansing Reports run on all
 Generic Inventory records and display, in summary or detail format, the
 data fields in the Generic Inventory that do not conform to the
 established CoreFLS Data Cleansing guidelines.

        if you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
