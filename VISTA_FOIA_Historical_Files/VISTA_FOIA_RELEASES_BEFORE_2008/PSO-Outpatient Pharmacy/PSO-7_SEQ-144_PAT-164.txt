Description:
============

 1. MAC-1203-60093 & CAH-0104-30994
    There is one occasion in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application where
    The PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS field content from one prescription can be 
    carried over to another prescription automatically. This problem was
    identified in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] and Patient
    Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR] options. The scenario that this
    problem happens is the following:
  
        Patient has Rx A, which is active and the Patient Instructions field
        is not NULL (e.g. "FOR ALLERGIES"). Two new prescriptions are 
        entered through CPRS, Rx B and Rx C. Rx B is a duplicate of Rx A. 
        When finishing Rx B, an order check happens and Rx A is discontinued.
        Select Rx C and select to edit the Patient Instructions field. If 
        this field was NULL before, it will now show a default value, which
        is the content of the Patient Instruction field from Rx A ("FOR 
        ALLERGIES").
   
   Once this patch is installed, the software will clean up the PATIENT 
   INSTRUCTIONS from the previous prescription so that it does not get 
   carried over to the next prescription.

    WPB-1203-30124, WPB-0304-30572, CHA-0304-31232, TNV-0304-31453 
    & LOU-1203-41279
    Currently, when a date of death is entered into the DATE OF DEATH field
    (#.351) in the PATIENT file (#2) for a specific patient, all active 
    prescriptions for this patient are automatically discontinued. If the
    DATE OF DEATH is later removed because it was entered in error, a Mailman
    message containing a list of the patient's prescriptions that were active
    before the DATE OF DEATH was entered is generated and sent to all the 
    users that hold the PSORPH security key. The prescriptions on this list
    are then reviewed and reinstated on a case by case basis. The 
    reinstatement is made through the Discontinue Prescription(s) [PSO C] 
    option. A problem was found when, after using this option to reinstate 
    such prescription(s), a user moved to the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO
    LMOE FINISH] option and started processing pending prescriptions. More 
    specifically, when this user accepted a renewal for any patient, the old
    prescription was not being discontinued after the new prescription became
    active. As a result, the Medication Profile would show the same drug
    twice for the same patient. 
    
    Once this patch is installed, it will prevent that the Discontinue 
    Prescription(s) [PSO C] option from interfering with the Complete
    Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, which will stop the problem
    described above.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 It is recommended to perform this installation after normal business 
 hours.
  
 Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*164) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      PSO*7.0*164.
    
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
      Install? YES//" respond NO.
   
   7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   9. When prompted,"Device:HOME//" respond with the correct device. This
      patch can be queued to a P-Message.
  
   10. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
