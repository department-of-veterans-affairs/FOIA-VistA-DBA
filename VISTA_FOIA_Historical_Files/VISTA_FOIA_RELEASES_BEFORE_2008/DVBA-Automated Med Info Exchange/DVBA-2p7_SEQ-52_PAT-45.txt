Description:

 CAPRI C&P EXAM LIST CUSTOMIZATION
 =================================
 This patch involves functionality in the CAPRI GUI that is targeted for 
 the VHA C&P Clinic.  A new file, CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST (#396.15), was 
 installed by DVBA*2.7*42.  One new security key was also installed by that
 patch: DVBA CAPRI EXAM LIST EDIT. 
  
 Assign the key DVBA CAPRI EXAM LIST EDIT to the MAS ADPAC, C&P Clinic 
 Clerk, or other individual who is responsible for maintaining the list of 
 C&P exams performed at the site.  If the user does not have option 
 context "DVBA CAPRI GUI," assign it to their secondary menu.  
  
 The user should then log into the CAPRI GUI executable, version 
 [DVBA*2.7*45].  If they have the security key above (or programmer
 access), they will see "EDIT EXAM LIST PARAMETERS (MAS)" under "Tools" on
 the CAPRI menu bar.
  
 When selecting EDIT EXAM LIST PARAMETERS(MAS) for the first time, CAPRI 
 will automatically find the site's divisions and activate all exams for 
 each division in a default list.  The user will then be able to add new 
 lists or modify the default list that was created.
  
 If exams are turned off via future DVB patches, they will no longer show 
 in the "NEW EXAM" dialog.  If a patch releases a new exam, they will show 
 to all users until someone uses EDIT EXAM LIST PARAMETERS(MAS) to turn it 
 off, if that is the site's preference.
  
  
 OTHER GUI ENHANCEMENTS
 ======================
 1.  Remote version of CAPRI will display DNS/IP and Broker port 
 information in a new status bar in the remote site selector.  This is
 intended to help troubleshoot bad connections.
  
 2.  In the Tools menu of the Remote version, there will be displayed 
 a 2nd column of options containing links to websites and/or other tools
 and utilities as requested by VBA.  The user and site will be unable to
 add to or remove from this list.
  
 3.  The Tools menu option contains a new "Change Forwarding Address" 
 option.  This option will allow the user to specify a remote e-mail 
 address (ie. Exchange address) for receipt of automated AMIE mail 
 bulletins.  The remote address is screened to be sure it is within the VA 
 domain.
  
 4.  In the Remote version of CAPRI, when logging into a site for the 
 first time, remote e-mail address preference will be read from the home 
 server, loaded into the user's new person file profile at the remote site 
 and an informational message displayed notifying the user that the 
 preference has been established.   The message will not be displayed 
 upon subsequent connections.
  
 5.  The Tools menu contains a new "Edit Exam List Paramaters (MAS)" 
 option described elsewhere in this document.  For users who do not hold 
 the DVBA CAPRI EXAM LIST EDIT or have "@" Fileman access, the option will 
 be invisible.
  
 6.  The CAPRI menu bar utilizes a new Office 2000 style icon/graphical 
 format.
  
 7.  In the Remote version, for users with the "@" or "U" fileman access,
 there will be a "Check Remote Connections" option under the Help menu
 item.
  
 8.  The CAPRI patient selector contains a new "Other Facilities Visited by
 Vet" button.  If remote site information is detected via MPI, this button
 will allow the user to select a remote site and switch to that site if
 they are using CAPRI-Remote.
  
 9.  FHIE data available is detected during the patient selection 
 process.  An informational "DoD Data is Available" message will appear in 
 the patient selector if FHIE data is identified.
  
 10.  The "C&P Exams" tab "Exam Requests" listbox has been reformatted to
 correctly place items in columns for easier reading.
  
 11.  Re-Print Final C&P exams button has been added to the C&P Exams tab.
  
 12.  "Add a New Request" on the "C&P Exams" tab allows patient address to 
 be edited directly in the displayed dialog instead of requiring the user 
 to switch the address tab.
  
 13.  The "Add a New C&P Exam" dialog has been updated to respect the new
 exam list functionality described elsewhere in this document.  "Routing
 Location Information" and "Information about this Exam List" status
 messages have been added to the template.  The exam list itself has been
 modified to display valid exams in black and invalid exams in red.  Popup
 messages may appear during exam selection, depending on how the exam list
 has been set up by the C&P clinic or MAS utilizing the new exam list
 function.
  
 14.  "Exam Request Template" button has been added to the "Add a New C&P 
 Exam" dialog.  This button will activate a multi-page template designed 
 by VBA to create an accurate and complete examination request of VHA.  
 The function is optional.  The user may still manually type their request 
 in the space provided.
  
 15.  The patient-specific "Reports" tab has been updated with the 
 following report choices and support dialogs:  View Registration Data, 
 Patient Profile MAS (Full), Surgery Report.
  
 16.  A new "Admin" tab has been added that contains Address and 
 Appointment information.  The previous "Address" and "Appointment" tabs 
 have been removed.  This will allow further expansion of admin functions 
 without using premium screen real estate.
  
 17.  CPRS AdHoc health summaries dialog has been added to the "Health 
 Summaries" tab.  To access it, click the new "Adhoc Report" button.  The 
 Dialog is a port of the CPRS function and will appear and work exactly as 
 in CPRS.
  
 18.  On the "Health Summary" tab, the "HS Component" dropdown list will be
 generated after executing any remote or local health summary.  This list 
 will allow the user to jump to a specific section of the HS report more 
 quickly.
  
 19.  Slight printing difficulties (data spilling onto a second page) have
 been remedied that relate to a specific printer brand and model used
 within VBA.
  
 20.  The "Report Builder" on the "Clinical Documents" tab has been 
 updated with an "Add All" function.  Depending on what type of data is 
 being displayed, the button will allow all listed reports to be 
 automatically selected for printing/viewing.  
  
 21.  If the patient has FHIE data, a DoD Records tab will be displayed to 
 allow access to that data.  If FHIE data is not available, the tab will 
 be greyed out or made non-visible depending on the user's Windows 
 configuration.
  
 22.  Non-patient specific reports found under menu option "FILE / REPORTS"
 contains the following new report types and support dialogs:  AMIS 290 by
 Division, Insufficient Exam Report, Print C&P Final Report (Manual), 
 Re-Print C&P Final Report(s),  Reprint a 21 Day Certificate, Reprint a 
 Notice of Discharge, 21 Day Certificate Printing.
  
 23.  CAPRI-Remote audit trail now records Claim Number of the veteran 
 when the log entry is made on the home server.
  
 24.  During entry of new patient, invalid characters (ie. semicolon) are 
 specifically screened out prior to upload attempt to VistA.
  
 25.  Whenever a site's divisions are displayed, the list will be 
 displayed with the parent facility at the top.  Previously, the list was 
 alphabetical.  The list will now appear in the same order as in VistA.
  
 26.  Audit trail reports will be found under the Help menu of CAPRI-Remote
 if the user has "@" or "U" Fileman access.
  
 27.  Pressing "Cancel" during Broker log-in will allow CAPRI to exit 
 gracefully instead of displaying Windows application error messages.
  
 28.  In CAPRI-Remote, the list of remote sites available contains an 
 entry for each division of the primary site instead of containing all the 
 divisions on a single line.
  
 29.  The division list on the C&P exam request and 7131 request dialogs 
 is displayed in IEN order instead of alphabetical order.  
      (MAN-0702-13020     ROUTING LOCATION)
  
 30.  EDIT HOME SYSTEM PATIENTS:  The button to execute this function will
 only be visible if a user has "@" or "U" as their Fileman security code.  
 In addition, the user must be assigned a limited patient list in 
 CAPRI-Remote. If both of these conditions are true, then a button labeled
 "Edit Selected Pt." will appear on the patient selection screen.  The user
 can select a patient in the limited patient list, click the new button and
 edit the following fields in the home server patient file:  name, ssn,
 DOB, sex.  Only users who are administrators should be assigned the "U"
 Fileman security code.
  
 31.  ERROR TRAP VERSION INFO:  Three new variables will be created in the 
 error trap should a problem occur: DVBABVR1, DVBABVR2, DVBABVR3.  These
 variables are informational and will display VistA server version of the
 CAPRI software, the user's CAPRI client version, and the user's name.
  
 32.  Additional duplicate patient code has been placed into the new 
 patient entry screens.  This will prevent the sporadic past problems with 
 duplicate patients by re-verifing the need to create a new patient 
 following exceptions during the new patient creation process.
