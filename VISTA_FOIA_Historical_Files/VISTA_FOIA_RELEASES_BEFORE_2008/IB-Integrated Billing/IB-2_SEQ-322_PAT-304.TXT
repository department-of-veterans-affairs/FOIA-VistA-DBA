Subject: IB NOT BILLING ALL CT ENTRIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues.
  
 The first issue deals with the Automated Biller's failure to bill
 legitimate Claims Tracking entries when the answer to the NEED RELATED TO
 OCCUPATION or the NEED RELATED TO AN ACCIDENT field, for the most recent
 entry in the DISPOSITION LOG-IN DATE/TIME multiple of the Patient file,
 is UNKNOWN or NULL.
  
 The second issue involves a syntax error that sites encountered when
 trying to compile routine IBCSC4B in Cache.

 2. HD0000000064281  MAD-1004-40375  Error in Compiling IBCSC4B in Cache

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000067129  IB Not Billing All CT Entries
  
    Problem:
    --------
    IB currently looks to see that the NEED TO RELATED TO OCCUPATION or
    the NEED RELATED TO AN ACCIDENT fields in the DISPOSITION LOG-IN
    DATE/TIME SUB-FILE of the Patient file (#2) does not contain N(NO).
    Which means, it could be YES, UNKNOWN or NULL. As long as the value in
    either of these fields is something OTHER than NO, the Auto Biller will
    not create a third party claim, as it assumes the care may be related 
    to an injury or accident, which would make it a tort case.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    It was recommended that routine IBCU82 be modified so that IB will bill
    the CT entry unless the answer to the NEED TO RELATED TO OCCUPATION 
    or the NEED RELATED TO AN ACCIDENT field is specifically set to Y(YES)
    only.
  
  
 2. HD0000000064281  MAD-1004-40375  Error in Compiling IBCSC4B in Cache
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site received a syntax error when they were trying to compile routine
    IBCSC4B in Cache.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Corrected the syntax error 'Missing right parenthesis' at line
    WE+2^IBCSC4B to avoid the problem.
