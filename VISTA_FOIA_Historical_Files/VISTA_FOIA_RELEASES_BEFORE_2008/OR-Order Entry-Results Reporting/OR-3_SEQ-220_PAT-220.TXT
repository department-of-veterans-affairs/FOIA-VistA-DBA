Subject: PSI-04-019 - Notification Improvements

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Problems and Issues:
 ====================
  
 1. [PSI-04-019] Change to get division for use in notification parameters
 based on patient's location.  For this use it is the patient's location
 when the order related to the alert was placed.  If the patient's location 
 does not exist for the order then the user's division values will be used
 for the notification parameters.  In general, orders entered in CPRS will
 have the patient's location.
  
 2. [CQ 6240] Screen out expired orders that have already been renewed from
 the expired orders display.  Previously, order's that had been renewed were
 continuing to show up on this specific display.  They no longer need to be
 displayed here because the purpose of this display is to show the user
 possible orders that may need to be renewed.
  
 3. [CAH-0504-31121(Remedy 70733), FGH-0803-31351(Remedy 70235)] Adds ability 
 for notification lab threshold parameters to hold up to two decimal places 
 on threshold values.  Previously parameters did not support values with 
 decimals.
  
 4. [E3R 16709,14381] Expands flagged orderable item functionality to send 
 alerts to provider recipients.  To accomplish this, the following new 
 parameters have been added:
  
    ORB OI EXPIRING - INPT PR   Flag Items for INPT EXPIRING Prov Recip
    ORB OI EXPIRING - OUTPT PR  Flag Items for OUTPT EXPIRING Prov Recip
    ORB OI ORDERED - INPT PR    Flag Items for INPT ORDER Providr Recip
    ORB OI ORDERED - OUTPT PR   Flag Items for OUTPT ORDER Providr Recip
    ORB OI RESULTS - INPT PR    Flag Items for INPT RESULT Provid Recip
    ORB OI RESULTS - OUTPT PR   Flag Items for OUTPT RESULT Provid Recip
  
 These parameters can be set at the Division and System levels.  Access
 these parameters through the following option path.  (Flagging orderable 
 items for inpatients is shown as an example.)
  
 Select OPTION NAME: ORMGR       CPRS Manager Menu     menu
  
 Select CPRS Manager Menu Option: PE  CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)

 Select "1 or 2" to flag inpt ORDERS, "3 or 4" to flag inpt RESULTS, "5 or 
 6" to flag inpt EXPIRING orders: 2
  
 Flag Items for INPT ORDER Providr Recip may be set for the following:
  
      1   Division      DIV    [choose from INSTITUTION]
      2   System        SYS    [DEVCUR.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV]
  
 Enter selection: 2  System   DEVCUR.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV
