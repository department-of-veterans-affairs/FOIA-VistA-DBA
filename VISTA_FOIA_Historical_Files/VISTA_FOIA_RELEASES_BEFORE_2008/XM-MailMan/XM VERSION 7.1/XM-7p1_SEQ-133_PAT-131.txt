 Let site decide whether or not to let a user drop out of a non-self-enrolling
 mail group.  A new field has been added to file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS,
 and option XMKSP has been updated to include it.  Here's the new field:
 
 STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #4.3 -- MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE
 STORED IN ^XMB(1,  (1 ENTRY)   (VERSION 7.1)
 
 DATA     NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
 ELEMENT  TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4.3,22   DROP OUT OF RESTRICTED GROUP 2;2 SET
  
                            '0' FOR NO;
                            '1' FOR YES;
          LAST EDITED:      JUN 06, 2000
          HELP-PROMPT:      Let users drop out of non-self-enrolling mail
                            groups?
          DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES if you wish to allow users to drop
                            out of non-self-enrolling mail groups.  The
                            users will be warned that this is a
                            non-self-enrolling group, and that they won't
                            be allowed to rejoin later, and then they will
                            be asked to re-confirm the decision to drop out.
  
                            Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default.)
                            Then users will have to contact IRM or the mail
                            group coordinator to ask to be dropped.
  
          TECHNICAL DESCR:  If a mail group is not a self-enrolling mail
                            group, then users can't just join.  They must
                            be added by the mail group coordinator.
  
                            If a user no longer wishes to be a member of
                            such a group, he must ask the group coordinator
                            to drop him.  But what if the group coordinator
                            has left the organization or is unresponsive?
                            Then what?  Then the user will have to ask IRM
                            to help.  This problem can be avoided by
                            setting this field to YES.
  
                            Some would argue that the coordinator added the
                            user to the group for a reason, and the user
                            should not be allowed to drop out.  (Perhaps
                            the coordinator is the user's boss.)  They
                            would argue that it is MailMan's job to prevent
                            the user from dropping out.  (Set the field to
                            NO.) Others would argue that it is not
                            MailMan's job at all, but the boss's job to
                            prevent the user from dropping out, and to
                            discipline the user if he does.  (Set the field
                            to YES.)
 
 *Note: If you do nothing with this new field, then this patch will not
 change MailMan's behavior.  Users will not be able to drop out of
 non-self-enrolling mail groups.
 
 Additionally,
 
 This patch introduces two more new APIs:
  $$TPMSGCT^XMXUTIL - returns # of new priority messages in a user's mailbox.
  $$BPMSGCT^XMXUTIL - returns # of new priority messages in a user's basket.
 
 This patch fixes a problem noticed on FORUM that could cause infinite looping
 of error messages from remote sites.
 
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*107, XM*7.1*124,
 XM*7.1*127, and XM*7.1*130.
