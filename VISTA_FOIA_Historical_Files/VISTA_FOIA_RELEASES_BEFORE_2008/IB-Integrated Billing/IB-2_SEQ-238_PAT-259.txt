Subject: PHARMACY COPAY CAP REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will provide a new report to the Patient Billing
 Reports Menu [IB OUTPUT PATIENT REPORTS MENU] of the VistA
 Integrated Billing Package.  The report will be produced by
 running the new option Facility Pharmacy Co-Pay Cap Summary
 Report [IBARXM FACILITY CAP SUMM RPT] which will invoke the
 new routine, IBARXMO1, released with this patch.
  
 This summary report is being requested by the VHA Chief
 Business Office (CBO) to satisfy five metrics calculated at
 each site on an annual basis that will be sent back to the
 CBO for manual compilation.  Each facility will run the
 report at the end of each calendar year during the month
 of January and submit the results to the designated
 Business Implementation Manager (BIM) at the VISN.  Each
 BIM will submit the end of calendar year report for each
 station in their VISN by the close of business on January
 31 of each year.  The CBO will notify the VISNs as to the
 Point of Contact to submit the report in advance of the
 due date.
  
 Last year's Congressional hearing stated that the VistA
 software will track and record the number of occurrences
 where Enrollment Priority Group 2-6 veterans reached and
 may have potentially exceeded the annual maximum billing
 cap.  There is a need to collect national statistics on
 the medication co-payment to determine: how many veterans
 reached the cap and how many days on average it took to
 reach the cap; average amount billed to veterans who did
 not reach the cap and the amount which could potentially
 have been billed had the cap not been in place.  This
 information will help identify the impact of the cap on
 collections in the last year and for the current year.
 Determining how close veterans were to reaching the cap
 as well as how much money could have been collected if
 no cap were in place will also help in understanding the
 impact of the cap on collections.
  
 The following identifies the five data elements the Facility
 Pharmacy Co-Pay Cap Report should capture from VistA:
  
   1. Total Vets Billed: This is the total number of Enrollment
      Priority Group 2-6 veterans from a site who were billed
      the medication co-payment in the calendar year selected
      by the user.  This number does not include those veterans
      who were billed at another facility whose station number
      is less than that of the current facility (such veterans
      will be counted on the report of the "low-station number"
      facility).
  
   2. Total Vets At or Above the Cap: From the veterans in (1)
      above, this is the total number of veterans who were billed
      the cap amount and then never received another
      prescription/fill, plus those veterans who were billed the
      cap amount and continued to receive prescriptions/fills.
  
   3. Average Number of Days to Reach Cap: For those veterans
      in (2) above, this is the average number of days, from the
      beginning of the calendar year, that elapsed before the
      veteran was billed a co-payment charge that caused him/her
      to reach the annual billing cap amount.
  
   4. Average Amount Charged to Those Not Reaching Cap: For those
      veterans in (1) that are not counted in (2), this is the
      average amount that was billed to the veteran in the
      selected calendar year.
  
   5. Potential Billable Amount: For those veterans in (2)
      who received prescriptions/fills that were not billed,
      this is the total amount that could have been charged
      for those prescriptions if the cap were not in place.
