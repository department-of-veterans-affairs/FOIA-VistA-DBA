 "Secretary Principi directed the Under Secretary for Health, through the 
 VHA Chief Financial Officer, to develop a revenue cycle improvement plan. 
 To accomplish this charge, the VHA Chief Financial Officer assembled two 
 groups of experts in the form of two distinct committees:  (i) VHA 
 Revenue Cycle Steering Committee -- comprised of a diverse group of VA 
 senior management -- provided vision and strategic oversight of the plan; 
 (ii) VHA Revenue Cycle Work Group, comprised of Central Office and field 
 staff, which developed the detailed recommendations of the plan."
  
 "This vision of the Revenue Program is based on two solid principles: the 
 principles of standardization and accountability.  The standardization of 
 policy, technology, data capture, measurement, and training and education 
 should enhance VHA's ability to effectively manage its revenue cycle."
  
 Within this report, the following was tasked.
  
 "Develop and mandate use of electronic encounter forms & documentation 
 templates"
  
  
 Rationale
 ---------
 VHA provider documentation, in many instances, lacks the required 
 elements that result in either a non-billable service or a lower valued 
 service.  Each VISN, and in many cases, each line of service, may use 
 different encounter forms and documentation templates for encounter data 
 capture. 
  
 Description 
 -----------
 This plan proposes collaboration among Revenue Office and OI staff to 
 develop standardized, electronic encounter forms for use in the CPRS 
 system that can be used throughout the VHA by clinicians.  Providers at
 several medical centers contributed their expertise in the development of
 the documentation templates and the encounter forms.  After completing
 their review, they suggested broadening the code sets, as well as 
 sectioning the forms.  This would allow clinicians easier access to the
 appropriate code(s).  The use of the electronic claim form will eliminate
 the need for manual data entry into PCE or Appointment Manager.  These
 encounter forms will ensure the standardization of code sets for specialty
 areas in the near-term and all areas eventually; they will reduce or
 eliminate the data validation required by coders to ensure proper code
 assignment.  This patch is to correct problems relating to encounter forms
 only.
  
 Outcome(s)
 ----------
 Electronic encounter forms will benefit VHA through improved quality of
 data capture.  In addition, the implementation of national encounter forms
 will eliminate the manpower required to create encounter forms at each 
 facility while also ensuring standardization.
  
 A new performance measure is being developed to monitor the percentage of 
 encounters with electronic notes.
