Run Date: JUL 16, 2002                     Designation: MPIF*1*20
Package : MPIF - MASTER PATIENT INDEX VISTA Priority: Mandatory
Version : 1        SEQ #21                      Status: Released

Associated patches: (v)MPIF*1*21   <<= must be installed BEFORE `MPIF*1*20'

Subject: Remote Procedures

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

   NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
   avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
   of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
   This patch contains routines and REMOTE PROCEDURE (#8994) file entries
   to assist the Data Quality Management team and the Master Patient Index/
   Patient Demographics development team in performing tasks that currently
   require dial-in access to the local VistA system. [NOTE:  There are 
   still activities that require the development team to dial-in to the
   system, so access for them should remain in place].
  
   The remote procedures will allow the following:
   (1) remotely inactivating a patient from the Master Patient Index (MPI) 
   (following all rules for inactivation of an Integration Control Number 
   (ICN) from the MPI),
   (2) remotely attempting to initialize a patient to the MPI (this will 
   present the patient to the MPI for ICN assignment but will NOT be 
   interactive as is done by the local Single Patient Initialization 
   option),
   (3) remotely update the Coordinating Master of Record (#991.03) field 
   in the PATIENT (#2) file,
   (4) remotely update the Integration Control Number (#991.01), ICN 
   Checksum (#991.02), and Coordinating Master of Record (#991.03) fields
   in the PATIENT (#2) file (this will not be used to create ICN
   assignments, but to resolve exceptions that have been logged on the MPI
   in Austin.),
   (5) remotely find the status of an ICN (to include, CMOR, CMOR history,
   ICN History, current ICN and any pending exceptions) and display it to 
   the user,
   (6) remotely find and return the extended patient data in an array that 
   can be used by other developers for comparison or formatted display, and
   (7) remotely check if a duplicate Social Security Number (SSN) found on 
   the MPI for the same CMOR really exist multiple times at the CMOR site,
   and if the ICNs for these SSNs exist on the site also.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.   
  
    The patch installed in less than 5 minutes at all test sites.
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Via TaskMan, unschedule the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] if it is scheduled to run 
        during installation of this patch.
  
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*20.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
   10.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Inactivate Patient from MPI             [MPIF PAT INACT]
         Single Patient Initialization to MPI    [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]
         Display Only Query              [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] 
         Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
         10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
         Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
         Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
         Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
    
   11.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
  
   12.  Reschedule, via TaskMan, the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] if unscheduled in step 4.
