Description:
============

  >>> IMPORTANT NOTE:
    ***  Prior to installation of this patch, coordination with the   ***
    ***  MAS ADPAC is imperative, as this patch will cause changes    ***
    ***  to DSS Identifiers (Stop Codes).                             ***
  
 SD*5.3*307 is a special patch requested by Pharmacy to add Stop Code 161 
 prior to the FY04 annual update and to provide instructions for setting up 
 the transitional pharmacy clinic that will be utilized by outpatient 
 pharmacy.  This  DSS identifier is to be associated with the newly 
 established Transitional Pharmacy Benefit program.  This stop code will be 
 used for the recording of the clinical pharmacist interventions with the 
 veterans eligible for this program only during the period of eligibility.
 
 This patch modifies the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).
  
    1) This patch installs 1 new DSS Identifiers for FY 2004.
  
 
    NOTE:  Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided during
    its installation and may be reviewed with the Install File Print option
    on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation and Distribution
    System.  Included in the changes made are the following new codes and
    modified codes.
  
  
    a)  New Code
        --------
  
      ID            Name                                      CDR #
      --            ----                                      -----
     161    TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT                     2610.0
 
 
 The Transitional Pharmacy Benefit clinic should be set up with the
 following characteristics.
  1. Should not have the PRINCIPAL CLINIC field in the Hospital Location 
     file (#44) filled in (so it will be selectable for Outpatient Pharmacy 
     TPB Rx (Prescription) entry)
  2. Should use 161 as the primary stop code (so no bills will be generated)
  3. Mark clinic as a COUNT clinic (needed to count as workload)
  4. Do NOT create a scheduling grid
  5. Should reflect the Diagnosis  Code V68.1 and Default Diagnosis should 
     be set to Yes
  6. Length of App't field should be set to 30
  7. Most of the test sites chose to assign all TPB workload to one division 
     and therefore they only created one TPB clinic.  If your site wants to 
     report TPB workload under separate divisions you'll setup separate 
     clinics for each division.  The name should be specific so pharmacy 
     staff can easily chose the one for their division

 Pharmacy Benefit clinic follow:
