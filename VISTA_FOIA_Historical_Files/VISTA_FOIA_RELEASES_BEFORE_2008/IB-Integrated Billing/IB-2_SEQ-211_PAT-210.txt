 Description:
 ===========
  
 This patch is the Integrated Billing part of Code Set Versioning project. 
 There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
 Overview
 --------
 This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
 Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
 routines and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
 the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
 Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
 implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
 and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 The patch IB*2.0*210 provides the following modifications, related to the 
 HIPAA Code Set Versioning requirements:
  
 1) The IB package was modified to ensure, that only CPT code and CPT 
 modifiers, ICD diagnosis and procedure codes that are valid for the date 
 of service shall be selectable by the user, regardless of when an entry or
 edit is made. That will guarantee that the selected code belongs to the
 Code Set, active for the date of service.
  
 2) The method of accessing data for ICD0, ICD9 and DRG codes has been 
 changed. Previously IB was using the direct global access for retrieving 
 the above data. With this patch, the IB package will be only using
 external API calls. That ensures, that the retrieved data will belong to
 the required Code Set Version, depending on the date of service. These
 modifications have been made in accordance with HIPAA CSV requirements.
  
 3) The IB calls to the DRG Grouper interface have been modified by this 
 patch. In accordance with the HIPAA Code Set Versioning project 
 requirements, the DRG Grouper interface has been extended to accept one
 more parameter - the Date of Service, to return the DRG data regarding the
 date of service, using the corresponding DRG Code Set Version. All
 occurrences of the DRG Grouper usage in the IB package, have been modified
 to pass the additional parameter. Thus the IB will retrieve data of
 correct version, in accordance with the HIPAA CSV requirements.
