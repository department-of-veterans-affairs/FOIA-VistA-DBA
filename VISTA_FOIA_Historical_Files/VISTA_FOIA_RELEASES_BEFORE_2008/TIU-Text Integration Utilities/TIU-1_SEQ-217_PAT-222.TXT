Subject: TIU Work Copy Modification & Form Letter Functionality

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the current, standard footer when printing a WORK COPY 
 note by removing sensitive patient information such as the SSN and DOB.
 
 New functionality is also provided with a new document class entitled 'FORM
 LETTERS'. The new document class allows a custom heading, closing, and footer
 that replaces the standard TIU header and footer to allow standard notes
 to be used as FORM LETTERS suitable for mailing, etc.  The new parameters may
 be set at an individual (TITLE) level or Document Class level to apply to all
 titles in the FORM LETTERS class.

      DOCUMENT CLASS entitled FORM LETTERS.

 Press RETURN to continue...
 ---------------------------
 
 When printing a document title from the new document class, CHART or WORK
 copy is ignored and will print as a FORM LETTER - omitting the standard header
 and footer.
 
 The use of TIU OBJECTS/PATIENT DATA objects is supported in the new fields and
 should be used with care to avoid including any sensitive patient data if the
 document is to be printed and/or mailed to that patient.  Objects that return
 either a single line or multiple lines of data are supported.
 
 The HEADING will print at the top of THE FIRST PAGE.  A blank line follows
 the heading to separate it from the note body.
 
 The FOOTER will print at the bottom of EVERY PAGE.  A blank line precedes the
 footer to separate it from the note body.
 
 The CLOSING will print at the END of the document.  One blank line precedes
 the closing to separate it from the note body.
 
 PAGE NUMBERS may be displayed in the format 'Page X of X'.  It will print
 immediately after the footer (if present).
 
 The default placement for all new segments is LEFT JUSTIFIED if left blank.
 
 When viewing titles in the FORM LETTERS class in the CPRS GUI, the heading,
 closing and footer will be displayed giving an indication of what the 
 document will look like when printed.  Page numbers are not displayed, but
 will display during printing if selected.
 
 The title FORM LETTER EXAMPLE is installed INACTIVE.
 
 When printing a FORM LETTER title with addenda the parent and all the addenda 
 will be printed with the FORM LETTER customizations.
 
 When printing an ID note, if the ID note is in the FORM LETTER Document Class,
 the ID note will be printed as a FORM LETTER.  Child documents of an ID Note
 in the FORM LETTER Document Class are not supported and will not print.  Only
 the parent document will be printed.
 
 If the ID note is NOT in the FORM LETTER Document Class but has children notes
 that ARE in the FORM LETTER Document Class, the parent and children notes will
 all be printed as follows:
 
      ID note will be printed as a Chart or Work copy (user selected if 
      applicable).  The usual TIU Header/Footer will be printed.
 
      ID child documents will print as FORM LETTERs with all custom
      parameters.
