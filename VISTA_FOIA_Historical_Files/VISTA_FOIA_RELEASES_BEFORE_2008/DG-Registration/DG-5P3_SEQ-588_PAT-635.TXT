Subject: 801 SCREEN TO PCE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Print Template
  - Sort Template
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is an enhancement to the 801 screen functionality.  There are
 no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
 It is expected that this functionality will not be used except as a 
 backup to the usage of the Quadramed Encoder Product Suite.
  
  
 Functional Description:
 =======================
 Currently, the inpatient professional encounter data captured on the PTF
 801 screen does not transmit to the National Patient Care Database (NPCD),
 and the workload is not captured.  The Ambulatory Care Messaging project
 in patch DG*5.3*617 provided the functionality to send inpatient data from
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) to the NPCD; however it does not provide the
 functionality to send the data from the PTF 801 Screen to PCE.  This patch
 will provide this functionality.
  
 After the user has sent the 801 record to PCE, any changes made to the 801
 record will result in the deletion of the 801 record in PCE.  The 801
 record will be resent to PCE upon user request or when the PTF record is
 released.
  
 The user has the option of sending the 801 screen data from either the
 Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN] or Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF
 QUICK LOAD] option.  801 screens which are not sent by the user will 
 appear on the Pro Fee Coding Not Send to PCE [DG PRO FEE NOT SENT TO PCE]
 on the PTF Output Menu [DG PTF OUTPUT MENU].  The user is prompted to
 select a date range for this report or accept the default T-30 to T.  If
 the screens are not sent by the user, they will be sent when the record is
 released.
  
 Included in this patch is a new mail group DG PTF 801 TO PCE ERROR.  This 
 mail group and the sender of the 801 data in PTF will receive messages if
 an 801 data to PCE filing error occurs.
  
 This patch modifies the Provider edits to be the same as the edits in PCE.
 When a CPT code is changed, the associated CPT Modifiers are cleared so
 that the correct CPT modifiers for the new CPT code will be entered.
  
 The Rendering Location field was made required and a check added so only
 locations with stop code can be used.  Sites will no longer be allowed to
 code 801 entries for Fee Basis patients.
  
 This patch also changes the 801 screen code to allow the user to jump to
 any 801 screen and use the double question mark to list all the 801
 screens before going to the next one.  When entering F to edit the 801
 screen the user can enter the number of the 801 screen after the F (Ex.
 F2). The 801 entries will now be display in date/time order.
  
  
  
 Technical Description:
 ======================
  
 A delete flag has been added to the 801 screen information in the PTF file
 (#45).  A conversion program runs at the end of the release to populate
 this field.  The conversion program is automatically deleted after it is
 run.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Salem, VA
 Salisbury, NC
 Cleveland, OH
 Portland, OR
  
  
  
  
 ====================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =======================
 Installation will take about 15 minutes.  It is best to install during
 non-peak hours because of the options that will be affected.  
  
 Note: Each site must determine the coding staff members / responsibility
 for researching and correcting data filing errors to PCE.  These staff
 members should be included in the new e-mail group named DG PTF 801 TO PCE
 ERROR in order to receive the MailMan messages. Please be aware that
 during installation process the new e-mail group 'DG PTF 801 TO PCE ERROR'
 will be created and the installer will be asked to provide a name of the
 coordinator for this new e-mail group.
