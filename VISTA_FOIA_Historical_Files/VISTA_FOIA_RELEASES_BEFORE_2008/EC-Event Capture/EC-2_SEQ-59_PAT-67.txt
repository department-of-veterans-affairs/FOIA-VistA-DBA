 (6) After the updates to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file are made,
     the patch performs an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS 
     (#720.3) file. Any active EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file record 
     which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file record, 
     or to an inactive CPT (#81) file record, will be identified.
   
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user that performs the patch installation.
   
  Example of the MailMan message:
   
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
   
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*67 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
   
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
   
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
   
     The National Procedure for the following Event Code
     Screen (500-3-4-245) is inactive or will soon be inactive --
     Location:  ALBANY
     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: FOCUSED COGNITIVE EVALUATION, LEVEL 1 (SP019)
     Inactivation Date: OCT 01, 2003
   
     The CPT procedure for the following Event
     Code Screen (500-3-4-90844) is inactive --
     Location:  ALBANY
     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: PSYCHOTHERAPY, 45-50 MIN. (90844)
    
     2 Event Code Screens were found to be pointing to an inactive
     or soon to be inactive procedure in file #725 or file #81.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended that
 it be queued to run after normal business hours.
   
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
   
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*67)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EC*2.0*67.
   
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
   
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
   
     9. You may delete the routines EC2P67PT, EC725U26 and EC725U27 from 
        your production system after the patch has been successfully
        installed.
   
     NOTE:  Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided 
     during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install File
     Print option on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation and
     Distribution System.
