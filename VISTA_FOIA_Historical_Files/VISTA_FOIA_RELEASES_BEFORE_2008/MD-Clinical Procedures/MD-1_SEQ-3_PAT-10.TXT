 ************************************************************************
 ATTENTION
 Clinical Procedures v.1.0 is a Controlled Release.  Therefore, the 
 compliance dates that are exported with released patches will ONLY apply to
 all sites that have installed and implemented Clinical Procedures in their 
 Production Account.  For the sites that have not installed or implemented 
 Clinical Procedures, the compliance dates for all released patches will be 
 30 days AFTER each site has installed and implemented Clinical Procedures 
 into its Production Account and has signed off with the Technical Support 
 Office that the package is running successfully with at least one medical 
 device in their Production Account.

 1) Palo Alto, Dayton, and Wilmington reported that part of another patient's
    report was appended to a report that was displayed in the Procedures
    (local only) component within the CPRS (Computerized Patient Record
    System) Reports tab.  Routine MDPS1 was modified to check the temp global
    that holds the report text during the report display so only the report of
    the patient selected was displayed.  This problem only happened when more
    than one application was using the Consults API to retrieve the Consult
    detailed Report at the same time.  
 
    Modified Routine: MDPS1
    Resolved: PSI-05-003

 2) The Procedure (local Only) report component under the Reports tab in CPRS
    uses the Medicine View file (#690.2) to produce the data for display for 
    the Medicine reports.  The Medicine data are displayed in a linear format 
    in the report.  Routine MDPS1 is modified to use MDARP3 to obtain the 
    Medicine report data for display using the print format of the print
    templates in the Medicine package.  After the installation of this patch,
    the Procedure (Local Only) will utilize MDPS1 and MDARP to obtain the 
    Medicine data for display and the reports will be using the print template
    format in the Medicine package.
