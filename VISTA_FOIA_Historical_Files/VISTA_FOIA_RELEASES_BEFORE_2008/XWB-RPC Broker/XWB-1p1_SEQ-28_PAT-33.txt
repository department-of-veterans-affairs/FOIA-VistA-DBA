Subject: Removal of XUESAP.TLB from workstations

Category: 
  - Other

Description: 
============

 This patch unregisters and removes the file XUESAP.TLB, installed in 
 patch XWB*1.1*29, from workstations.  
  
 The xuesap.tlb type library was related to the Enterprise Single Sign-On
 which uses the user's NT Username and Domain via an Authentication Proxy
 Server to connect the user to a VistA server. This project has been
 terminated and the components associated with the project are being
 removed.
  
 This patch is distributed as a zip file, and its contents are listed
 below.  The file XWB1_1P33RM.txt should be read before installation.
 For installations in which patch XWB*1.1*29 was run on each workstation,
 the installation program can be run on the workstations or a remote
 installation using the batch file provided (XWB1_1P33.BAT).
  
 The executable XWB1_1P29PG.EXE may have been installed on the local 
 workstation or on a network server that can be accessed by the 
 workstation.  However, the files must be unregistered on each 
 workstation.  The included batch file XWB1_1P33.BAT can be used to 
 perform the process of unregistration and removal on workstations where 
 the files are located or where a server installation is used.  For 
 additional information related to remote processing, you may refer to 
 the documentation included in the Install Guide XWB1_1P33IG.TXT.
  
 If the type library was previously installed (with XWB*1.1*29) on a 
 network server, it is recommended that the current installation NOT be 
 run on the network server until the workstations have been unregistered.
 Running the installation program on a workstation or server will 
 unregister and then remove the file XUESAP.TLB on that system.
  
 If the files were installed on a network server, unzip the file on a 
 workstation, then copy the file XWB1_1P33.bat to the directory on the 
 network server where XUESAP.TLB is located.  Then have the following line 
 of code run on each workstation (where servername represents the name of 
 the server on which the files are installed, and the path shown is the 
 default path for the installation).
  
 The following is ONE line of code ---
  
 "\\servername\program files\vista\common files\XWB1_1P33.bat" 
 "\\servername\program files\vista\common files\"
  
 Above was ONE line of code --
  
 this will remove the registration for the file.

 When the installation program XWB1_1P33WS.exe is run, it will unregister
 the file XUESAP.TLB and then remove it, it may add a copy of tregsvr.exe
 file to the installation directory (default is 
 C:\Program Files\Vista\Common Files) and this file was probably already
 present from the installation of XWB*1.1*29.
