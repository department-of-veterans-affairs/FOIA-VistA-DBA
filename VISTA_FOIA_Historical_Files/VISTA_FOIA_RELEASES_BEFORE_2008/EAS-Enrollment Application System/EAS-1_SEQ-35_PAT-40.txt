 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 This patch introduces enhancements to the VistA Enrollment Application 
 System, needed to support the Millennium Healthcare and Benefit Act, 
 Public Law 106-117 Section 101.  This law defines the application of 
 copayments for veterans receiving Long Term Care (LTC) services.  This 
 patch represents Phase IV of the Long Term Care Copayments project and 
 will address the following requirements:
  
 1. The financial data screens in the Add, Edit and View a LTC Copayment 
 Test options will be modified to reflect the format changes made to the 
 Application for Extended Care (10-10EC) paper form.
  
 2. The system will support the display and printing of the LTC Copayment 
 Tests in either the old or new 10-10EC format, depending on which one was 
 used to complete the test.
  
 3. A new menu option will be added to print a choice of two reports:  one 
 is of veterans whose LTC copayment test (10-10EC) has already expired, 
 the other is of veterans whose LTC copayment test (10-10EC)  is due to 
 expire within a user-specified period of time.  The user will be prompted 
 to select which report they wish to print and either a date range (for 
 expired tests) or a number of days (for tests pending expiration).
  
 4. The user will be able to indicate if a veteran is legally separated 
 and if so the copayments will be calculated using the rules for an 
 unmarried veteran.
  
 5. The options to Add or Edit a LTC Copayment test will be modified to 
 enable the user to indicate that the veteran is exempt from LTC 
 copayments (for a reason other than low income) and complete the LTC 
 Copay Test without having to go through all of the financial screens.  
  
 6. The Eligibility Status Data (Screen 2) in the Add, Edit and View a LTC 
 Copayment Test options will be replaced by the Insurance Data (Screen 5) 
 from the Registration options.
  
 7. The format of the Calculated LTC Copayments report will be modified.  
 The user will be prompted to choose to print the copayments for either 
 inpatient or outpatient services, then enter the patient's LTC admission 
 date (for the inpatient report) and report start date.
  
  
 NOIS CALLS
 ==========
 This patch will resolve the following NOIS calls:
  
 TUA-0803-31858     LTC CO-PAY - CHANGING REASON FOR EXEMPTION
 ASH-0303-30561     LTC AND A&A AND VA PEN ELIG

                     LEGALLY SEPARATED = "YES", then the
                     calculation used will be the same as an
                     unmarried veteran.
                     This question will be asked if the field
                     MARRIED THIS YEAR (#.14) = "YES".

                      FIELD)= #.16
                      This trigger cross-reference will update the
                      Residing in the Community field (#.16).  If
                      Legally Separated="YES", the Residing in the

   Triggered Field:  LEGALLY SEPARATED  (408.22,.17)
       Description:  This trigger cross-reference will update the Legally
                     Separated field (#.17).  If Married This Year="NO", 
                     the Legally Separated field will be deleted.  
                     CREATE CONDITION)= #.14="NO"
                     CREATE VALUE)= @
                     DELETE CONDITION)= #.14=""

   DESCRIPTION:      This field indicates which version of the
                     10-10EC form was used to complete the LTC copay

                     vehicle if the veteran is receiving only

                     Exclude from this amount the value of household
                     furniture and other household goods, clothing,

 It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business 
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
   Installation Steps:
   ==================
   
   1. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
      mapped set at this time.
     
   2. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and select the
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
   3. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu [XPD
      MAIN], select the Installation menu.
   
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*40).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
         
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*40.

      rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
   
   7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
   8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select
