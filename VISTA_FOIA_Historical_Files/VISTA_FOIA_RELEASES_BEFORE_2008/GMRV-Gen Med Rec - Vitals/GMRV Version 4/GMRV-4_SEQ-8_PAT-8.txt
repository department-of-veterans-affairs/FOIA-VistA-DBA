Subject: GMRVPCE0 API ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 1)  This patch is dependent upon GMRV*4*7 to be installed.  This patch
 will update three API routines, GMRVPCE0, GMRVPCE2, and GMRVPCE3, to
 support Pain tracking.
  
  
  VALIDATE^GMRVPCE0(.Input/Output_Array)
  STORE^GMRVPCE0(.Input/Output_Array)
  These entry points now support the validation and storage of patient pain
  score data.  The input array node should be structured as shown below
  (note: the third piece [measurement units] should be null).
  SET ARRAY("VITALS",Provider_IEN,Sequence_Number) =
  "PN^Pain_Score[0-10,99]^^Date/Time_Measurement_Taken"
  ...
  DO STORE or VALIDATE^GMRVPCE0(.ARRAY)
  
  
  HELP^GMRVPCE0(Vital_Type,Output_Array_Name)
  This entry point now returns help text for the PAIN vitals type.  The
  text returned by this entry point is shown below.
  DO HELP^GMRVPCE0("PN","ARRAY")
  ARRAY(1) = Enter pain scale number (0-10,99).
  ARRAY(2) = 0       = patient verbalizes no pain.
  ARRAY(3) = 1 to 10 = patient verbalizes having pain.
  ARRAY(4) =          ( 1=slightly uncomfortable/minimal pain)
  ARRAY(5) =          (10=worst imaginable pain)
  ARRAY(6) = 99      = patient unable to respond/communicate pain level.  
  ARRAY(7) = Examples:  99 or 5
  
  
  $$RATECHK^GMRVPCE0(Vital_Type,Measurement,Measurement_Units)
  This entry point now includes an input transform to check a patient pain
  score.  The third parameter (Measurement_Units) is not used with the PAIN
  vital type and should be omitted.  See below.
  IF $$RATECHK^GMRVPCE0("PN",Pain_Score[0-10,99]) WRITE !,"Valid data"
  ELSE  WRITE !,"Invalid data"
  
  
 See DBIA 1589 for further details regarding this API.
              
 The post-install routine GMRV408 will add 'PN' to the PCE ABBREVIATION
 field (#7) for the 'PAIN' entry in the GMRV VITAL TYPE file (#120.51).
  
 2)  Also fixed in this patch is the input transform for blood pressure
 (see NOIS DAN-0299-41249).  The systolic value must now be greater than
 the diastolic value.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  This patch may be installed with users on the system.  Installation of
  this patch will take less than 5 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
      load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
      the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
      select the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
      options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRV*4.0*8):
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       b.  Print Transport Global
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
       d.  Backup a Transport Global
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      GMRV*4.0*8.
  
  6.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
      Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO"
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
      should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
      has run to completion.
                                 
  8.  Delete the post-init routine GMRV408 after installation
      of the patch.
