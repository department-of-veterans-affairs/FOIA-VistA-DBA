Description: 
============

 This patch is an enhancement to the software. It provides a link to the
 Lab package so that data for Cytology and Surgical Pathology lab tests can
 be passed to the Women's Health (WH) package.
  
 The Lab patch LR*5.2*231 must be installed in order for this link to work.
 The new WH field IMPORT TESTS FROM LAB (#.24) in the WV SITE PARAMETER
 (#790.02) file must be set to YES for each entry that wishes to activate
 the link between the Lab and Women's Health packages.
  
 The WH package uses two data extract routines in the Health Summary
 package to display lab test results to the WH user. This patch can be
 installed without the Health Summary (v2.7) package, however the WH user
 will not be able to see lab test results within the WH package.
  
 Summary of the Enhancement:
 ===========================
  
 When Lab patch LR*5.2*231 is installed and a lab report is 'released' for
 a Cytology or Surgical Pathology test, the Lab package will automatically
 call an entry point in the WH package. The Lab package will pass the
 patient identification number (i.e., DFN), the internal entry number of
 the LAB DATA file (#63) entry, the inverse date/time value of the FILE 63
 entry, the zero node of the FILE 63 entry and the type of test (i.e., CY
 for cytology or SP for surgical pathology). A mail message is sent to the
 WH Case Manager for that patient stating that lab test results are
 available.
  
 At present, there is no way to automatically link the lab test to a
 particular WH procedure type (e.g., PAP SMEAR). Therefore, the lab data
 cannot be immediately entered as a WH procedure in the WV PROCEDURE file
 (#790.1).
  
 Instead, the lab data will be held initially in a new WH file, WV LAB
 TESTS (#790.08). The WH user will use a new option, Save a Lab Test as
 Procedure [WV SAVE LAB TEST] option on the Patient Management [WV
 MENU-PATIENT MANAGEMENT] menu to view a list of lab tests that have been
 passed to the WH package. After selecting a lab test from the list, the
 user will see the same lab information that is displayed in the Cytology
 or Surgical Pathology portion of a Health Summary Report.
  
 After viewing the lab information the user:
  
 a) Can ignore the lab test which will leave it on the list so it can
    can be addressed at a future time.
  
 b) Can delete the lab test from the list because it is not something
    to be tracked in the WH package. 
  
    NOTE: This will not delete it from the LAB package.
  
 c) Can add the lab test as a new procedure in the WH Procedure (#790.1)
    file in which case the user will be asked to select a WH procedure type
    (e.g., PAP Smear) for the lab test. The lab test will be immediately
    saved as a WH procedure entry and the user will be taken into the 'Edit
    a Procedure' data entry screen where the entry can be completed. The
    lab test is taken off the list when converted into a FILE 790.1 entry.
  
 If a lab test is ever removed from a released status (e.g., using the
 Modify anat path gross/micro/dx/frozen section [LRAPM] option), the Lab
 Package will notify the WH package. If the lab test was saved as a FILE
 790.1 entry, the WH Case Manager for that patient will receive a mail
 message indicating the lab test report status has been changed and the
 status of the FILE 790.1 entry has been set to O(pen).
  
 If a lab test is ever transferred from one patient to another using the
 Move anatomic path accession [LRAPMV] option in the Lab package, the Lab
 package will notify the WH package. If that lab test was saved as a FILE
 790.1 entry, the WH Case Manager for that patient will receive a mail
 message indicating the patient originaly associated with the lab test was
 changed, the RESULTS/DIAGNOSIS field is set to 'Error/disregard' and the
 lab test results are no longer associated with that FILE 790.1 entry.
  
  
 Associated NOIS: None.
  Associated E3R: None. Requested by the Women Veterans Health Program
