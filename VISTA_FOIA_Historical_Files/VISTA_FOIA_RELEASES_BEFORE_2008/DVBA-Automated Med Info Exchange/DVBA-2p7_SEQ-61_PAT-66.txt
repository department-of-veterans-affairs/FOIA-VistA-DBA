Subject: CAPRI GUI UPDATE - C&P WORKSHEET MODULE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch has been released to announce an update to the
 CAPRI GUI executable: the Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module
 (CPWM).  The new GUI will utilize several security keys referred to in
 DVBA*2.7*53.  If your site has not yet set up those keys for C&P
 providers, please review the patch description for DVBA*2.7*53 prior to
 distributing this version of the GUI to your C&P staff.
  
 Note that this GUI primarily provides VHA C&P provider functionality.  
 Namely, a new function has been added to create C&P exam templates that
 feed into TIU and resolve simultaneously in AMIE.  Refer to patch 
 DVBA*2.7*53 for further details.  Some VHA sites may not have
 traditionally deployed CAPRI in the past, but this new functionality is
 intended for use at VAMC's.
  
 CAPRI users with the appropriate security keys will see 4 C&P templates 
 within the CAPRI software.  Future C&P exam templates will be released in
 the form of VistA patches that will automatically activate themselves in
 this new GUI.  Local sites do not currently have the option to modify
 templates.  To suggest changes or provide comments on the content of the 
 templates, please direct all communication to the TVH CPEP NEWS mailgroup
 on Outlook.
  
 As a reminder, users of this GUI will need corresponding TIU C&P titles.  
 Review patch DVBA*2.7*53 for more information.  IRM/IT Services may wish
 to provide Clinical Application Coordinators the DVBA*2.7*53 patch
 description and DVBA*2.7*66 CAPRI GUI so these titles can be set up
 correctly.
  
  
 TRAINING
 ========
 The National Training and Education Office (NT&EO) has created the 
 following CAPRI CPWM training website to provide you with information,
 video demonstrations and materials to support your understanding of the
 Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module:
 "http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/vistau/capri/default.htm"
 This web site will be periodically updated with new information, links and
 other materials to support the use of CAPRI CPWM at your site.
  
  
 GUI CHANGES
 ===========
 1.  A new "C&P Worksheets" tab will be available to those provided the
     DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB key or one of the DVBA CPWM keys referred to
     in DVBA*2.7*53.  (Those with the "@" symbol for Fileman security will
     see all CAPRI options by default, despite their security keys.)
  
 2.  The TOOLS | UNSIGNED C&P WORKSHEETS menu option has been added to 
     assist users with locating their unsigned templates.  It's tied to the
     same keys as the "C&P Worksheets" tab.
  
 3.  CAPRI will automatically search for unsigned worksheets at login and 
     display an appropriate message reminding the user to complete their 
     worksheets, if they have any.  The user can immediately call up the 
     unsigned worksheets dialog from the informational message.
  
 4.  If a user is identified as a reviewer by assignment of the DVBAB CPWM 
     REVIEWER key and there are new documents to review, they will be
     prompted at login, similar to the message users receive for unsigned
     worksheets.
  
 5.  There is a new "Uncosigned C&P Worksheet Utility" menu option on the 
     TOOLS menu.  This is tied to the DVBA CAPRI EXAM LIST EDIT key.  Users
     (such as C&P clerks) who are responsible for transferring co-signed
     C&P exams from TIU to AMIE can use this new option to automate the
     process for templates created in CAPRI-CPWM that are co-signed in
     CPRS/TIU.

 USER ACCESS TO CAPRI
 ====================
 (Please refer to patch DVBA*2.7*53 for information on assigning access to 
 the new C&P Worksheet tab.)
 CAPRI users without the "@" sign and programmer access will have to be
 assigned an option context.  The security aspect of CAPRI is that it looks
 for option context DVBA CAPRI GUI in the user's menu structure (part of a
 primary menu or on a secondary menu).  So if the option is not assigned in
 some fashion, the user will get a message that they do not have access to
 CAPRI.
  
 There are two ways to grant a user access to CAPRI.
  
    * You can add CAPRI GUI Broker [DVBA CAPRI GUI] as an ITEM in the
      OPTION file on a user's assigned primary menu.
  
    * You can place CAPRI GUI Broker [DVBA CAPRI GUI] on a user's
      individual secondary menu.
