Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The installation of patch ONC*2.11*1 will abort with a "null subscript" error
 if there is no data in any of the following files:
 
 #160   ONCOLOGY PATIENT
 #160.1 ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS

 This abort occurs when the KIDS install runs the ONCOPST Post-Install
 routine.  This patch will allow you to restart the KIDS install at the
 point it aborted and successfully complete it.
 
 NOTE: IF YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED PATCH ONC*2.11*1 THERE IS NO
       NEED TO INSTALL THIS PATCH.  THIS PATCH IS FOR THOSE SITES WHO
       HAVE NOT BEEN USING THE ONCOLOGY PACKAGE AND HAVE NO DATA IN THE
       ABOVE FILES.

    three routines: ONCOPST
                    ONCOPST1
                    ONCOPST2 
 
 2) Restart the KIDS install using the "Restart Install of Package(s)" option.
    At "Select INSTALL NAME:" enter "ONC*2.11*1".  KIDS will resume 
    installing patch ONC*2.11*1 and now go to completion.
