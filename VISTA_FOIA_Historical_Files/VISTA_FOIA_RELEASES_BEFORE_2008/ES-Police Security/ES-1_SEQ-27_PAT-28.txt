Subject: ES*1*22 CAN'T EXIT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch corrects the problem of not being able to exit when displaying
  to the screen from the 'Print Conversion Reports' submenu located under 
  '[ESP CONVERSION FOR ES*1*22] Conversion Management for ES*1*22' menu.
  
  This patch also corrects a problem that was discovered at the test site
  where if you sent the report to a slave printer the terminal screen
  remained hung.
  
  This was reported in NOIS as message NYN-0898-11176.  The routine 
  ESP122P1 was modified to correct this problem.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.
  
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE 
      SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
      at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*28):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global  - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
  
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*28.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
        Conversion Management for ES*1*22   [ESP CONVERSION FOR ES*1*22]
  
  7.  If a routine was unmapped as part of step 2, it should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - ESP122P1

 Routine ESP122P1 was modified at line tags PRINT, CONV, DHRC, USER, HDRU
 and EOR.
  
 At line tags HDRU and HDRC the call to DIR was changed to not execute 
 before printing the first page.
  
 At line tags CONV and USER after each call to HDRC and HDRU a check was
 added to determine if an up arrow was entered.  This is also reflected in
 the tag PRINT.  If an up arrow is entered, then processing is terminated.
  
 At line tags PRINT and EOR upon the completion of printing the reports,
 the output device is closed using a call to ^%ZISC and the terminal is
 is reopened by the U 0 command.  This is so that the call to ^DIR in the
 tag EOR is able to access the terminal to display an exit prompt.
