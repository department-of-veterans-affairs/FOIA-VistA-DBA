Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*51 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
  
 NOTE: PATCH HL*1.6*57 MUST BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH.
       LA*5.2*51 SHOULD BE INSTALLED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INSTALLATION OF
       PATCH HL*1.6*57 TO AVOID INTERRUPTION OF LABORATORY ELECTRONIC DATA
       INTERCHANGE (LEDI) HL7 MESSAGE TRANSMISSION.
  
  
 With the release of patch HL*1.6*57 several changes need to be made to the
 Lab LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP] option. Patch LA*5.2*51 will make the following
 changes to allow Lab LEDI HL7 interfaces to continue to function.
  
  1. The patch removes references to HL LOWER LEVEL PROTOCOL PARAMETER file
     (#869.2) by the LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP] option.
  
  2. The post-install deletes entries with the LA7V* namespace from the
     HL LOWER LEVEL PROTOCOL PARAMETER file (#869.2). This file is no longer
     used by the Health Level Seven (HL) software to store communication
     parameters. This data has been moved to the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870)
     by patch HL*1.6*57.
  
  3. The post-install changes the name of protocol LA7V Order from xxx to
     LA7V Order to xxx in the PROTOCOL file (#101), where xxx is the VA
     station number that an order message (ORM) is being sent to.
     The protocol was incorrectly named which could be confusing.
  
  4. The post-install deletes protocols that were previously setup by the
     LEDI Setup option but which are presently not being used.
     If protocols are found with the following names they will be deleted:
      LA7V Query Response to xxx
      LA7V Query for Results from xxx
      LA7V Receive Query from xxx
      LA7V Send Query to xxx
      LA7V Send Response to xxx
      LA7V Order Response to xxx
      (where xxx is the VA station number)
  
  5. The post-install converts and updates existing LA7V* protocols to
     conform to the new rules introduced by patch HL*1.6*57.
  
  6. The patch changes the LEDI Setup option to create protocols based on
     the rules implemented with patch HL*1.6*57.

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minutes. This patch
   can be installed with Laboratory users on the system. Recommend
   that the patch be installed during a period of minimum Laboratory
   package activity.
  
   However, the following conditions apply:
  
      - All Lab LEDI (LA7V*) related HL v1.6 LLPs should be shutdown.
        These LLPs are name spaced LA7V* when viewed in the HL package
        Systems Link Monitor [HL MESSAGE MONITOR] option.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel, MailMan and HL patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
       prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
       option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in your
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
       a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   7.  Perform the following step if applicable:
  
       All Lab LEDI (LA7V*) related HL v1.6 LLPs should be shutdown.
       Use Start/Stop Links [HL START] option to shutdown these LLPs if
       they are running.
  
   8.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*51'.  When prompted 'Want to
       DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',
       choose 'YES'.
  
       Disable the LEDI Setup [LA7V LEDI] option by having KIDS mark the
       option 'Out Of Order'.
  
   9.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  10.  Routine LA51 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
  
  
 1. Restart any LA7V* LLPs that were shutdown before patch installation.
    Use Start/Stop Links [HL START] option.
