Description:
============

 This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch for the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit
 (TPB) project. This patch consists of automated processes and additional
 tools designed to assist the sites for which Transitional Pharmacy Benefit
 data have not been accurately reported.
   
 Two of the most common events that have contributed to the discrepancies
 in the TPB data are:
   
    a) TPB prescriptions have been entered for TPB eligible patients via the
       wrong Outpatient Pharmacy prescription processing options, such as
       the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option and Complete
       Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option.
   
    b) Patients who did not wish to take advantage of the TPB benefit or who are
       not prescribed medication after a VA appointment are still active for
       the TPB benefit in the system.  The inactivation of the TPB benefit is 
       automatic when the last active TPB prescription is discontinued either 
       through an Outpatient Pharmacy package action or through an action taken
       in CPRS. The entry of a prescription/order will not inactivate the 
       benefit unless the result is that the last active TPB prescription is
       discontinued as a result of the new entry. 
    
 This patch is comprised of four components that will help the sites identify
 and fix the data discrepancies described above. It will also provide them 
 with new tools to monitor events that could have an impact on patient's TPB
 eligibility. In some cases the patient's TPB eligibility will be updated
 automatically.
   
 Below is a detailed description of each component:
  
    1) MARKING TPB PATIENT Rx's AS TPB (ONE-TIME PROCESS - POST INSTALL)
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       Problem: Because some prescriptions have been entered through the
                wrong menu options (see item a) above), these Rx's have not 
                been correctly identified as TPB prescriptions. In other 
                words, they have a different patient status than "NON-VA" AND
                do not contain a TPB flag in PRESCRIPTION file (#52), and 
                therefore, are not identifiable as prescriptions filled
                under the TPB program.
  
       Solution: A Post-Install process will search for prescriptions filled
                 under the TPB program which are not marked as such and
                 will mark these prescriptions as TPB. The two requisites 
                 that must be fulfilled for a prescription to be marked as 
                 TPB, are:
     
                   a) The prescription was entered during the period that
                      the patient's TPB benefit was active.
  
                                       AND
  
                   b) The provider for the prescription is a "NON-VA"
                      provider.
                    
                 If the requisites above are fulfilled, the following 
                 updates will be done for the prescription:
  
                   a) Patient status will be changed to "NON-VA".
                   b) If an UNIQUE TPB clinic is identified (STOP CODE
                      equals 161) for the site, clinic will be changed to
                      this clinic.
                   c) The TPB flag will be set in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
      
       Report: At the end of this process, a Mailman message will be sent
               to the newly created mail group called PSO TPB GROUP. The 
               patients reported on this message had at least one Prescription
               edited by the Post-Install process. The sites will have the
               ability to enter the coordinator of this new mail group at time
               of installation of this patch. Even if the coordinator is not
               entered, this patch assures that at least the installer of the
               patch is a member of the mail group. The fields reported on this
               Mailman message are: PATIENT NAME(LAST4SSN), Rx#, DRUG NAME, 
               PROVIDER NAME, CLINIC (Old and New) and the Rx PATIENT STATUS
               (Old and New).
    
       Important: If the site identifies prescriptions on this report that
                  have been wrongly flagged as TPB, it is possible to manually
                  remove the TPB flag from such prescriptions through FileMan.
                  Just repeat the steps below for each prescription you wish
                  to remove the TPB flag (as in this example):
  
                  VA FileMan 22.0
     
                  Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
     
                  INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PRESCRIPTION
                  EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// TPB RX  
                  THEN EDIT FIELD:
       
                  Select PRESCRIPTION RX #: 123457690A  TYLENOL 250MG
                  TPB RX: YES// @
                     SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? Y  (Yes)
     
   
    
    2) INACTIVATING PATIENT'S TPB BENEFIT (ONE-TIME PROCESS - POST INSTALL)
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       Problem: Since not all patients eligible for the TPB program chose to
                take advantage of the TPB benefit or, after seeing the VA 
                provider the patient was not prescribed any medication, his/her
                TPB eligibility remained active, when in reality it should have 
                been inactivated.
   
       Solution: A Post-Install process will search for TPB eligible patients 
                 and automatically inactivate the TPB eligibility of the 
                 patients that fulfill both of the following
                 requisites:
                    
                    
                   a) Patient does not have any "active" TPB prescription(s) on
                      file. The prescription statuses considered as "active"
                      are the following:
                      ACTIVE, NON-VERIFIED, HOLD, DRUG INTERACTIONS, SUSPENDED
                      and PROVIDER HOLD.
     
                                           AND
     
                   b) Patient has had an appointment at a designated TPB Clinic
                      (determined through a set of clinic stop codes) since the
                      date his/her TPB benefit began.
      
       Report: At the end of this process, a Mailman message will be sent to
               the new mail group PSO TPB GROUP. The patients reported on this 
               message were inactivated as TPB patients by the Post-Install
               process. The fields reported on this message are: PATIENT NAME,
               LAST 4 DIGITS OF SSN, APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME, VA CLINIC NAME.
    
    3) PATIENT'S TPB BENEFIT INACTIVATION (ENHANCEMENT - CONTINUOUS PROCESS)
       ---------------------------------------------------------------------
       Outpatient Pharmacy software will be notified by the Scheduling software
       every time a patient has an appointment at a VA clinic. If the patient
       is eligible for the TPB benefit, the appointment was at a clinic defined
       as primary care for the TPB program (determined through a set of clinic 
       stop codes) AND the patient does not have any "active" (see list of 
       statuses on item #2a above) TPB prescription(s) on file, this patient
       will have the TPB eligibility automatically inactivated. 
     
       The TPB primary care clinics are identified by the stop code pairs
       listed below:
   
              322000    322185    322186    322187  
              323000    323185    323186    323187  
              350000    350185    350186    350187 
   
       A Mailman message will be sent to the PSO TPB GROUP mail group with the 
       following information:
        
           The following patient had the TPB (Transitional Pharmacy Benefit)
           Benefit automatically inactivated because the following appointment
           was found: 
    
                      Patient         : LAST,FIRST(9999)
                      VA Clinic       : EAST MIDWAY CLINIC
                      Appointment Date: DEC 02, 2003@11:15
   
    4) REPORT OF PATIENTS WITH TPB AND NON-TPB Rx's (NEW REPORT)
       [PSO TPB PATIENT RX REPORT]
       ---------------------------------------------------------
       This new report is being released as a stand-alone option. It will 
       print a list of TPB eligible patients that have "active" TPB and
       Non-TPB prescriptions on file. The report can be printed for ALL or
       selected institutions, as well as for ALL or selected TPB patients. It
       will be sorted by the INSTITUTION NAME first, then by the PATIENT NAME. 
       There will be a page-break for each individual institution. The column
       headings on the report are: PATIENT NAME (LAST4SSN), VA Rx#, TPB Rx#, 
       DRUG NAME. This option should be assigned to the site TPB Coordinator,
       Pharmacy ADPAC and any other individual deemed appropriate by the site.
       
 In order to allow the unflagging of TPB prescriptions as described in 1) 
 above, the TPB RX (#201) field in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file is being 
 changed from "UNEDITABLE" to "EDITABLE".

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Users can be on the system at the time of installation but it is recommended
 to perform this installation after normal business hours.
  
 Installation will take about 15 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*160) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*160.
   
   6. When prompted, "Queue the Post-Install to run at what Date@Time:" 
      respond with the appropriate date and time.
  
   7. When prompted "Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'PSO TPB 
      GROUP'", enter the name of the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB)
      coordinator at your site. Once the patch is installed, the
      coordinator should add as new members of this mail group the
      appropriate users.
  
   8. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
      Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
   9. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
  10. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
  11. When prompted,"Device:HOME//" respond with the correct device and DO 
      NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
  12. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  13. Assign stand alone option [PSO TPB PATIENT RX REPORT] to site TPB 
      Coordinator, Pharmacy ADPAC and any other individual designated to
      review eligibility of patients for the TPB program.
