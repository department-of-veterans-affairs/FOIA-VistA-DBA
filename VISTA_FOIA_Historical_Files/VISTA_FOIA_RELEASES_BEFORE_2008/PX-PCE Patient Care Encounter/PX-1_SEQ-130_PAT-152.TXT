Subject: INCREASE QUANTITY LIMIT ON CPT CODES AND FIX PROVIDER PROMPT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues:
 The first is that there is currently an upper limit of 99 for the 
 QUANTITY (#.16) field in the V CPT (#9000010.18) file. This is being
 changed to 999. 
   
 The second involves the provider prompt associated with a CPT code in the
 Check-Out interview. The provider prompt for a CPT will provide a default
 answer of the provider for the encounter. The user may hit the "enter" key
 to accept that default. However, if the default provider was "Doe,John"
 and there was also a "Doe,John A" in the new person file then the user
 will be prompted to choose between the 2 even though they have already
 chosen a specific person. This is redundant. This patch will cause the
 code to not do the second lookup if the user has chosen a specific
 provider provided by default. It should be noted that if the 2 providers 
 have exactly the same name then the user will still be prompted again at 
 the CPT Provider prompt. The reason is that there may be a rare case 
 where "Doe,John" #1 is the encounter provider and "Doe,John" #2 is the 
 CPT provider. If we don't prompt for which one the user wants then the 
 "Doe,John" #1 would automatically be used for the CPT provider prompt and 
 the user would not be able to select "Doe,John" #2.

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ====================
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Currently there is an upper limit of 99 for the QUANTITY (#.16) field
 in the V CPT (#9000010.18) file. There are cases where users need to enter
 a 3 digit number.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Change the validation code and the input transform to accept a 3 digit 
 number.
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 The provider prompt for a CPT will provide a default answer of the
 provider for the encounter. The user may hit the "enter" key to accept
 that default. However, if the default provider was "Doe,John" and there
 was also a "Doe,John A" in the new person file then the user will be
 prompted to choose between the 2 even though they have already chosen a
 specific person. This is redundant.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 If the user takes the default offered use that provider. Do not do the 
 lookup again.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is
 suggested that it be installed during non-peak hours. Installation will
 take less than 5 minutes. Users do not have to be off the system
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter PX*1.0*152)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*152.
  
 6. If prompted: ' Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? YES//' choose NO. 
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 9. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
         PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER
         SDAM APPT CHECK IN/OUT
         SDAM APPT MGT
  
  
 10. When prompted to select the protocols you would like to place out of 
     order press <Enter>
  
 11. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
