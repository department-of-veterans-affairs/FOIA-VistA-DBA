Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*485  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*525'

Subject: EWL ENROLLEE STATUS UPDATE REPLACEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 ** This patch replaces patch SD*5.3*486.  A Data Dictionary change has
     been made to correct and replace the "B" cross-reference of the .01
     PATIENT field of the EWL CLEAN-UP file (#409.39). Also, a change to
     the CLOSE command in the UPLOAD VSSC DATA option which corrects an
     "UNWIND" error.
 
 ** Sites that installed and completed the patch SD*5.3*486 process need only
     complete 2 steps: (1) re-index the "B" cross-reference in the SD 
     WAIT LIST (#409.3) file and (2) re-transmit by running the SD EWL
     BACKGROUND job.  They should just load the patch and directly proceed to 
     the last step by using the REMOVE ENROLLEE STATUS MENU & OPTIONS option.
  
  ** 
     
  In October of 2006, patch SD*5.3*485 (EWL CORRECTION FOR ENROLLEE STATUS 
  CALCULATION) was released to the field in order to correctly determine
  the EWL enrollee status. This patch changed the way the program utilizes
  the Treating Facility (TF) List file. For additional information on this
  process, please refer to the documentation for patch SD*5.3*485.
   
  This patch (SD*5.3*525) has been created to correct the EWL ENROLLEE
  STATUS field (#27) for those EWL records that were created prior to the
  installation of patch SD*5.3*485. This will ensure that all EWL records
  in the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3) have a correct EWL ENROLLEE STATUS.
  The original follow-up patch (SD*5.3*486) contained a corrupt cross-
  reference and is being replaced (patch for a patch) with SD*5.3*525.
   
  Due to the nature of the update process, this patch will be implemented
  in a phased approach, and will be coordinated by an Implementation
  Manager over the span of 3 to 4 weeks.
   
  A brief overview of the process follows. Please see the Installation
  Guide for the detailed instructions that will be needed to complete the
  process successfully. It is strongly suggested that a printed copy of
  the Installation Guide be available for reference during the install.
   
    1. Load patch SD*5.3*525.
   
    2. Use FTP to obtain a password protected and ZIPped VSSC data file 
       from a specified directory at the usual system servers. Passwords
       and directory information will be distributed by the Implementation
       Manager to the IRM staff member responsible for loading this patch.
       The VSSC file can be downloaded from specific servers at Albany
       (ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov), Hines (ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov), or 
       Salt Lake City (ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov). This process will take 
       between 15 to 30 minutes to complete the download. The ZIPped
       file is approximately 193 MB and the unzipped version of the
       file will require nearly 2 GB of storage space. NOTE: You may wish
       to store this file in a Temp subdirectory on your system for security
       purposes. Also, you must delete both the zipped and unzipped version
       of the file after completing the entire process (see step 9).
 
 **** Note: Sites which have been consolidated and can not access the
            VMS prompt will need to contact the consolidated data center
            for assistance. The consolidated center will need to download
            the 'ZIP/UNZIP' utility as described in the Installation Guide.
            The consolidated center will also need the password which is
            provided by the implementation manager.
   
    3. Unzip the FLAK9.ZIP file using the UnZip utility in VMS. The result
       will be a file called FLAK9.CSV. The Unzip process may take between
       1-5 minutes. If your site does not have the current version of the 
       Zip and UnZip utilities, please see the Installation Guide for the
       instructions on how to obtain them. Winzip WILL NOT WORK.
 
 **** WARNING: This installation must be completed during the same terminal
               session. Logging off before completion of the installation
               will require that the user re-start all steps outlined in
               the Installation Guide.
   
    4. Use the BACKUP/RESTORE EWL PATIENT FILE UTILITY to make a backup of
       the current entries in the SD Wait List file. This backup, stored in
       the EWL CLEAN-UP (# 409.39) file, can be used to restore the EWL
       Enrollee Status for file entries should the need occur.
   
    5. The next step is to upload all VSSC records for patient entries in
       the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3). Each record will be reformatted to
       VA standard data format and stored in a temporary VistA file. This
       process requires approximately 30 to 60 minutes. 
   
    6. After the upload has been completed, a recalculation process will
       be started with the use of the CREATE ENROLLEE TEMP FILE option. It
       will use the VSSC file, the Treating Facility file, and the 
       Enrollment API to calculate the correct EWL Enrollee status. These
       results will be stored in the EWL CLEAN-UP (#409.39) file.
   
    7. The next step is to print and view these recalculations
       by using the ENROLLEE CLEANUP REPORT option. The option provides
       Fileman Print access to the file. A suggested FM Print is included
       in the Installation Guide. Sort and Print templates are included.
   
    8. Finally, the option APPLY/REPAIR ENROLLEE STATUS will be used to
       apply the recalculated EWL Enrollee Status. If there is a problem,
       the site may use the BACKUP/RESTORE EWL PATIENT FILE UTILITY to 
       restore the original EWL Enrollee Status for the involved records
       (those EWL records created prior to the installation of patch 
       SD*5.3*485).
   
    9. As part of the post-installation process, sites are required to:
       (a) delete the FLAK9.zip and FLAK9.csv files from your VMS account,
       and (b) remove the CLEAN-UP ENROLLEE STATUS menu and its associated
       options by using the REMOVE ENROLLEE STATUS MENU & OPTIONS option.
   
  The set of utilities are included in the CLEAN-UP ENROLLEE STATUS MENU,
  which is part of the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) menu. The options in the 
  Clean-Up menu are listed in the order in which they should be used. The
  menu is locked with the SDWL PARAMETER key.
   
  Select Appointment Menu Option: WL  Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Menu
