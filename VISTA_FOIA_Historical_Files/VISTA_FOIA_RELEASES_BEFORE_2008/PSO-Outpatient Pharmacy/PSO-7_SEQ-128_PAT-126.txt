Subject: RX SUSPENSE FILE (#52.5), NEW INDEX ON CMOP INDICATOR FIELD (#3)

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is a partner patch with the Consolidated Mail Outpatient
 Pharmacy V. 2.0 (CMOP) patch PSX*2*41. PSO*7*126 must be installed before
 the CMOP patch at remote facilities. This patch will be adding new data 
 dictionaries to be used in conjunction with the CMOP patch PSX*2*41.
  
 1. Problem: VISNs have been combining facilities and the running time of
 transmissions is becoming very long.  The number of divisions has grown
 to about fifty in the largest VISN.  This means 100 transmissions must be
 processed each day.
  
 Solution: Several steps have been taken to reduce the time needed for
 transmissions.  A special index built with 'type' and 'division' has been
 added to CMOP INDICATOR field (#3) in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) that
 optimizes the picking of prescriptions for each transmission.
  
 2. Problem:   In support of the Hawaii DoD project, Pharmacy Data 
 Management V. 1.0 (PDM) needs to know when changes are made to entries 
 in the DRUG file (#50). To meet this need a call needs to be made to PDM 
 V. 1.0 routine PSSHUIDG at line tag DRG whenever an edit is made to the 
 DRUG file (#50).
  
 Solution: The routine PSOCMOP has been modified to call the PDM routine 
 PSSHUIDG
 when an edit is made to the DRUG file (#50).
  
 Environmental Check:
 ====================
 An environmental check routine will run to check if the RX # (#.01) field
 in the RX SUSPSENSE file (#52.5) is populated before continuing with
 install.  If this field is missing, the following message will appear:
  
      Checking the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) for missing RX # (#.01) fields.
  
      667    (A list of entry numbers that are missing the RX #(#.01) 
      field.)
      ...
  
      The RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) has been found to have entries without 
      a RX # (#.01) field.
  
      Please call NVS to clear this problem.
  
      <CR> - to continue:
  
      You will need to log a NOIS to National Vista Support (NVS) to have 
      this problem resolved before the installation can continue.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation may
 take approximately 20 minutes depending on how many CMOP prescriptions
 there are in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5). Installation can take place at
 any time of day but should not be performed during CMOP transmissions
  
 1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
      routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
      mapped set.
  
 3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
 4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*126):
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
      DDs, templates, etc.).
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5.   Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*126.
  
 6.   When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//" respond NO.
  
 7.   When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 8.   If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
  
 9.   A post-install routine will run to build the compound index for the
      RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) and populate the index with data.
