 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1.HD68477=BIL-1204-30048    LM allows forwarding using inactive user
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The issue is that the List Manager version of CPRS will allow the
    selection of a terminated user as the responsible user for forwarding
    a consult.  The CPRS GUI does not allow selection of a terminated user.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine GMRCAFRD has been modified to use $$PROVIDER^XUSER to determine
    if the person selected as responsible for forwarding the consult is an
    active user.  If a terminated person is selected, the following will
    be displayed and then the user will be prompted to select a new person
    to be responsible for forwarding the consult.
  
 ***User account is TERMINATED please choose another responsible person.***
  
 2. HD00000000100642     Allows cancelled by inactive user
  
    Problem :
    ---------
  
    The issue is that the List Manager version of CPRS will allow the
    selection of a terminated user as the responsible user for canceling
    a consult.  The CPRS GUI does not allow selection of a terminated user
    for this. 
  
    Resolution :
    ------------
  
    Routine GMRCADC has been modified to use $$PROVIDER^XUSER to determine
    if the person selected as responsible for canceling the consult is an
    active user.  If a terminated person is selected, the following will
    be displayed and then the user will be prompted to select a new person
    to be responsible for canceling the consult.
  
 ***User account is TERMINATED please choose another responsible person.***
