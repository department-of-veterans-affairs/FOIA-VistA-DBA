 take less than 1 minute.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.

       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
