Subject: CICSP - CT SURGERY CONSULT DATE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. This patch adds the SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) to the SURGERY 
 file (#130) for use by the Cardiac Risk Assessment module to document the 
 date that the patient was notified that Surgery was needed, effectively 
 documenting the start of the patient's wait time. 
  
 2. The Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC RESOURCE] option is updated to include 
 the SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) for input.
  
 3. The Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option is 
 updated to display the SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) when printing a 
 cardiac risk assessment.
  
 4. The missing information functionality for cardiac risk assessments is 
 updated to include the SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) for surgical
 cases after September 30, 2007. This functionality is used by the Update
 Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option and the
 List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST] option.
  
 5. The SURGERY CONSULT DATE field (#513) is added to the cardiac risk 
 assessment transmission data set.
  
 6. This patch adds the WAIT TIME START field (#21) to the SURGERY file 
 (#130). This field will be auto-populated when the SURGERY CONSULT DATE 
 field (#513) is entered. There are no plans to build additional functions 
 for this field at this time.
