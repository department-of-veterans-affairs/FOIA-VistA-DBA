Description:
============

  
 This patch adds some enhancements based on feedback received from the
 registry users during implementation of the Clinical Case Registries (CCR)
 v1.5.
  
 A new version of the CCR GUI and updated documentation are also exported
 as a part of this patch.
  
 1. Fixes
 --------
  
 [1.01] Microsoft Windows Server 2003
        -----------------------------
  
 The CCR GUI v1.5 did not install on the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with
 a message that the operating system version was not supported.
  
 The OS version check has been removed from the CCR GUI setup application.
  
 The Remedy tickets for this problem are HD0000000133975 and 
 HD0000000135398.
  
 [1.02] "Cannot focus a disabled or invisible window"
        ---------------------------------------------
  
 When a user tried to open a registry in the CCR GUI v1.5, the "Cannot 
 focus a disabled or invisible window" error message was displayed.
  
 The error occurred if the user had only the ROR VA HEPC USER and/or ROR VA
 HIV USER security key and a non-registry patient had already been selected
 in another CCOW-enabled application (e.g. CPRS).
  
 Regular users do not have access to the Registry tab of the CCR GUI. The
 GUI code erroneously tried to activate the tab and clear the patient list.
 The code has been fixed.
  
 The Remedy tickets for this problem are HD0000000134834 and 
 HD0000000136502.
  
 [1.03] Missing CDC bitmap error
        ------------------------
  
 When the CCR GUI was installed on a file server and started from the CPRS
 Tool menu, it did not print the CDC form. An error message about missing
 bitmap was displayed.
  
 The CCR GUI code erroneously used the current directory name to load CDC
 bitmaps instead of the application directory. As a result, the bitmaps
 could not be found when the CCR GUI was started from the CPRS Tool menu
 (the CPRS directory was the current one). The code has been fixed.
  
 The Remedy tickets for this problem are HD0000000135119 and 
 HD0000000143108.
  
 [1.04] CDC form was printed incorrectly
        --------------------------------
  
 Values for Section IX of the CDC form were printed incorrectly (fields
 and their paper counterparts were mixed up). Some of them were not saved 
 properly.
  
 The GUI code, CDC form definition (stored in the ICRCDCDEF instance of the
 ROR GUI PARAMETER parameter), and the RORRP026 routine have been amended.
 The SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT field (22.09) has been defined in the ROR
 HIV RECORD file (#799.4).
  
 [1.05] Lock timeouts
        -------------
  
 The locking strategy had been changed in the Cache v5.0. As a result, some
 code might stop working correctly at the sites that migrated to the new
 system.
  
 Lock timeout values have been increased.
  
 The RORLOCK, RORUPD05, and RORUPD51 routines have been amended.
  
 [1.06] Maximum number of patients to retrieve
        --------------------------------------
  
 When user changed the maximum number of patients to retrieve to 99999, the
 GUI accepted and saved the value despite the fact that the maximum value
 for this field was defined as 9999. When the user tried to open the
 Preferences dialog box again, the error message was displayed and the
 dialog box did not open.
  
 The GUI code has been amended and the maximum allowed value for the field
 was increased to 65535.
  
 The Remedy ticket for this problem is HD0000000144416.
  
 [1.07] Possible incorrect report sorting
        ---------------------------------
  
 XML encoded values were stored in the ROR TASK file (#798.8) instead of
 original ones when reports were generated.  This could cause sorting
 problems if the values contained characters '<', '>', '&', '"', or '''.
  
 The RORTSK10 and RORTSK11 routines have been amended to store original 
 values and encode them on the fly when report is loaded by the GUI.
  
 [1.08] Lock information
        ----------------
  
 Information about the user who locked some data for editing was lost 
 sometimes and "UNKNOWN USER" was shown in the warning message.
  
 The RORLOCK routine has been amended.
  
 [1.09] Typos in the routine comments
        -----------------------------
  
 Typos in the comment lines have been fixed in the ROR01, RORLOCK, RORX003,
 RORX003A, and RORX007A routines.
  
 [1.10] Typos in the documentation
        --------------------------
  
 CCR v1.5 Installation and Implementation Guide incorrectly referenced the 
 ROR HISTORICAL DATA EXTRACTION file as file #798.6. The correct file 
 number is 799.6.
  
 The ROR1_5IG.DOC file has been updated.
  
 The Remedy ticket for this problem is HD0000000134666.
  
 2. Updates
 ----------
  
 [2.01] Pharmacy Re-engineering APIs (file #52)
        ---------------------------------------
  
 Direct access to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) has been replaced with the 
 corresponding APIs. The following routines have been modified: RORHL03, 
 RORHL031, and RORHL07.
  
 [2.02] Pharmacy Re-engineering APIs (file #55)
        ----------------------------------------
  
 Direct access to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) has been replaced with
 the corresponding APIs. The following routines have been modified: 
 RORHL03, RORHL07, RORHL071, and RORHL15.
  
 [2.03] DBIA list updates
        -----------------
  
 Comments in the source code of the following routines (mostly, the lists 
 of integration agreements) have been updated : RORHL01, RORHL05, RORHL06,
 RORHL07, RORHL08, RORHL09, RORHL10, RORHL11, RORHL12, RORRP015, RORUTL05,
 RORX005A, and RORXU006.
  
 [2.04] New LOINC code for HIV
        ----------------------
  
 The 42600-7 LOINC code has been added to the VA HIV Lab search criteria in
 the ROR LAB SEARCH file (#798.9).
  
 [2.05] New generic drugs for HIV
        -------------------------
  
 DARUNAVIR, EFAVIRENZ/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR, and TIPRANAVIR have been
 added to the list of HIV generic drugs in the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
 (#799.51).
  
 [2.06] Installation Routines
        ---------------------
  
 Installation routines used by the ROR 1.5 KIDS build (RORP000, RORP000A
 and RORP00B) have been deleted.
  
 3. Enhancements
 ---------------
  
 [3.01] Selection date and selection rule columns
        -----------------------------------------
  
 CCR registry users requested addition of the date and short description of
 the earliest selection rule to the list of patients on the Registry tab. 
 This would greatly simplify the processing of pending patients.
  
 The GUI code and the RORRP020 routine have been modified.
  
 The E3R report number for this enhancement is 19778 (FORUM message
 #42995541).
  
  
 [3.02] Activate Task Manager tab when report is started
        ------------------------------------------------
  
 Many users requested that the Task Manager tab of the GUI be automatically
 activated when a report is started/scheduled. This would remind them where
 to find the results.
  
 The GUI code has been modified. The Task Manager tab will be activated 
 automatically when the Reports menu is opened (similar to the Registry
 menu and the Registry tab).
  
 [3.03] Include/Exclude filters for local fields and registries
        -------------------------------------------------------
  
 User request: "The current logic behind these filters is that people are
 included when these options are selected. In the future, it would be great
 to either include or exclude people based on each selected filter. For
 example, the user may have used a local field to identify who they don't
 want to include in a report but may want to include those patients with
 another local field set."
  
 The GUI code and M routines (RORTSK13 and RORXU005) have been modified.
  
 [3.04] Add "Delete" button on the Patient Edit dialog box
        --------------------------------------------------
  
 User request: "Would it be possible to add a Delete button to the Patient
 Data Editor? Currently, when clearing long lists of pending patients,
 generally you need to open the patient data editor to see the lab results.
 If you decide that the patient should be in the registry, you can hit the
 Save button. If you decide that the patient should not be in the registry,
 you have to hit the Cancel button, then the Delete button and then confirm
 the delete. If you decide that you need more information to process the 
 patient, then you hit the Cancel button. Could we add a delete button to
 the patient data editor to save the step of hitting cancel for those
 patients who are to be deleted? So there would be Save, Delete and Cancel
 buttons."
  
 The GUI code has been amended. When the user clicks the Delete button, the
 Patient Data Editor will close, and the regular delete warning will be 
 shown. If the user confirms the action, the patient will be deleted from 
 the registry.
  
 [3.05] Performed and Not Performed procedures
        --------------------------------------
  
 User request: "For the procedure report, frequently the question comes up 
 - who has NOT had a procedure e.g. vaccination, liver biopsy, etc. but is 
 getting care. Could we expand this report functionality to resemble the 
 Combined Medications and Labs report and have 3 check boxes -  'Had a
 procedure in the date range', 'Did NOT have a procedure in the date
 range', and 'Only among patients with utilization' in the utilization date
 range and then add the utilization date range selection panel the same as
 appears on the Combined Medications and Labs report."
  
 The GUI code, M routines (RORX015, RORX015A, and RORX015C), and report
 stylesheets (dialogs 7981015.001 and 7981015.002) have been amended.
  
 The Remedy ticket for this problem is HD0000000143612.
  
 [3.06] Procedures report
        -----------------
  
 The Procedures report will include inpatient procedures in addition to 
 outpatient ones.
  
  * If only inpatient procedures are selected, the same logic is
    used for procedures as that of the Diagnoses report for diagnoses.
    In other words, the OR logic is used for ICD-9 codes inside the 
    groups; the AND logic is used between the groups.
  
    If only outpatient procedures are selected, a patient is added to 
    the report when the patient has at least one CPT code selected on
    the CPT report parameters panel.
  
    If both inpatient and outpatient procedures are selected, the
    Procedures report selects a patient only when he/she has at least 
    one inpatient procedure (ICD-9) from each group or at least one
    selected outpatient procedure (CPT) is found. If at least one 
    ICD-9 group is not represented (i.e., no procedures were found 
    in one of the groups), then all inpatient procedures for this 
    patient are completely disregarded and not included in counts.
    However, this patient can be included in the report if they have
    outpatient procedures.
  
  * If the 'No selected procedures were performed' radio-button is 
    selected, then the decision made on the previous step is inverted.
    E.g., a patient is added to the report only if no outpatient 
    procedures are found and no inpatient procedures are found in 
    at least one of the groups.
  
  * If the 'Only patients who have received any care during the date 
    range' check-box is selected, then the code checks if the patient 
    had any Utilization in the provided date range. Otherwise, they 
    are excluded from the report.
  
 In any case, if a patient is not selected for the report, all 
 corresponding procedures are completely disregarded and not included in 
 counts.
  
 The GUI code, M routines (RORRP016, RORX015, RORX015A, and RORX015C), and
 report stylesheets (dialogs 7981015.001 and 7981015.002) have been
 modified.
  
 [3.07] Diagnoses report
        ----------------
  
 Parameters of the report and report output have been modified according to
 user requests. 
  
 The ICD-9 report parameters panel now works similarly to the medication
 selection panel: it is possible to define groups and add ICD-9 codes to
 those groups. The OR logic is used for codes inside groups; the AND logic
 is used between groups.
  
 The GUI code, M routines (RORTSK13, RORX013, RORX013A, and RORXU008), and
 report stylesheets (dialogs 7981013.001 and 7981013.002) have been
 modified.
  
 [3.08] AIDS OI check-box and AIDS Indicator Diseases
        ---------------------------------------------
  
 A new index has been added to the AIDS INDICATOR DISEASE multiple (10) of 
 ROR HIV RECORD file (#799.4). This index works as a "trigger" and
 automatically populates the CLINICAL AIDS (.02) and CLINICAL AIDS DATE
 (.03) fields of the ROR HIV RECORD file (#799.4). This will be reflected 
 by the status of the AIDS OI checkbox and the Date of AIDS OI field on the
 Patient Data Editor dialog box.
  
  
 The RORDD01 routine has been modified.
  
 [3.09] Patient Search
        --------------
  
 The set of valid patient search parameters (Registry tab of the GUI) has
 been updated. Now it is possible to enter # followed by the coded SSN
 (e.g. #59178309712). If the coded SSN is valid and the patient with
 corresponding SSN is in the registry, then the list of patients will be 
 populated with the patient record. Otherwise, the list will be cleared.
  
 The GUI code and M routines (RORRP019 and RORP020) have been amended. 
  
 [3.10] Combined Meds and Labs report
        -----------------------------
  
 The output format of the Combined Meds and Labs report has been changed 
 according to the user requests:
  
  * "Received selected medications" is checked, lab options are not 
     selected or "No selected lab tests were performed" is checked: 
     the report will contain only the medication table in the same 
     format as it had before.
  
  * "Selected lab tests were performed" is checked, pharmacy options 
     are not selected or "Did not receive selected medications" is 
     checked: the report will contain only the labs table in the same
     format as it had before.
  
  * Both "Received selected medications" and "Selected lab tests were 
    performed" are checked: 
  
     * if sorting on patient data fields is requested (default), then
       the report will contain set of meds and labs tables under the
       patient data headers (Patient A: Meds, Labs; Patient B: Meds, 
       Labs; etc.). The Meds table will be sorted by medication names 
       in ascending order. The Labs table will be sorted by test names 
       in ascending order and then by result dates in descending order.
  
     * If the user decides to sort this report either by labs or meds, 
       the report will transform into separate labs and meds tables.
  
  * Both "Did not receive selected medications" and "No selected lab 
    tests were performed" are checked: the report will contain list of 
    patients who have neither labs nor meds.
  
 Report stylesheets (dialogs 7981012.001 and 7981012.002) have been
 modified.
  
 [3.11] Patient Medication History report
        ---------------------------------
  
 Enhancement request: "In old Hepatitis C registry there was a report that 
 listed the dates of all fills for PEG interferon which some sites (i.e. 
 Coatesville) were using to see who was getting their peg refills and who 
 had stopped treatment.  We should create such a report in the new CCR.  
 It would basically modify the Registry Medication Report to list each 
 patient with the date for each fill of a registry med that they got in 
 the selected date range."
  
 In order to provide this functionality, the Patient Medication History 
 report has been modified as follow:
  
  * The "Consider All" and "Selected Only" radio-buttons have been 
    added to the "Select Patient" parameter panel.
  
  * If "Consider All" is selected, then the report will consider all 
    registry patients (taking into account the "Other Registries" and
    "Local Fields" parameters). Only patients who received selected
    medications will be included in the report.
  
  * If "Selected Only" is selected, then the "Other Registries" and 
    "Local Fields" panels will be disabled. The report will include 
    only selected patients. If a patient did not receive selected
    medications, then they will be added to the report anyway with 
    "No data" indicator.
  
  * Format of the patient data header has been changed a bit. It is 
    possible now to sort patients by name (default), last 4 digits 
    of SSN, date of birth, age, and date of death.
  
 The GUI code, M routine (RORX011), and report stylesheets (dialogs
 7981011.001 and 7981011.002) have been modified.
  
 [3.12] Current Inpatient List
        ----------------------
  
 The Date of Death column has been removed from the Current Inpatient List 
 report (it was redundant).
  
 The RORX002 routine has been modified.
