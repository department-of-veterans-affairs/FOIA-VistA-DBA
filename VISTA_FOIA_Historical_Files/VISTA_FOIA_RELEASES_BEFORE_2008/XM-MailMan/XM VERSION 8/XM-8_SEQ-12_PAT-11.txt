Subject: HANG ON A SECOND!

Category:

Description: 
============

 Patch XM*8.0*11
 
 NOIS: PAL-0402-60941
 Test Site: Palo Alto HCS
 
 When trying to connect to a site which is unreachable for whatever reason,
 MailMan may burn CPU cycles in a tight loop.  The patch adds a 1 second
 hang within the loop to mitigate that.
 
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum. It has no patch prerequisites, except that MailMan 8 must
 be installed.
