 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 HD0000000055636:
  
 Problem:
 --------
   The user had a question regarding the [ ECX PRO SOURCE  AUDIT ] report in 
   VISTA.  
   The report has two options. The report will return data in both summary and 
   detail format. In summary format,line item NPPD - 960F is reported with data. 
   When the same report is requested in detail format, the line item 960F is 
   not available.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
   When the user runs the Summary report it pulls the NPPD data from extract
   file 727.826. When the user runs the Detail report it pulls NPPD codes from
   ECXAPRO3 routine which does not have the 960 F listed. NPPD code 960 F -
   DENTAL IMPLANT was added to routine ECXAPRO3.
