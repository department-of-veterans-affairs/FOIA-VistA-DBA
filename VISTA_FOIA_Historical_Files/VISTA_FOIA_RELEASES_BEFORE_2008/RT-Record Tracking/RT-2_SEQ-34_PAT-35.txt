Subject: INVALID OUTPUT DEVICE & OTHER NOISES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses three NOIS issues involving the selection of invalid
 output devices, the inability of a user to add a new Record Type, and a
 change in how an "^" is handled in some options during the creation of
 new volumes.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. DAY-0701-40653  INVALID OUTPUT DEVICE DQ^RTL1
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Create a Label/Record/Volume [RT TRANS-CREATE]
    option under the Transaction Menu [RT TRANS-MENU], if the choice
    is made not to use the file room's default devices, the system
    allows the user to select a device (SLAVE) that does not allow
    queueing.  When Taskman then attempts to set up a queue, an error
    occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine RTL1 has been modified to check on the device selected
    and display a warning if an unsuitable device is selected.
  
 2. PUG-0800-52237   UNABLE TO ADD RECORD TYPE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Certain users are not able to add a record when using the
    Type of Record Set-Up [RT SYS-RECORD TYPE] option under the
    System Definition Menu [RT SYS-MENU].
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine RTSYS has been modified to allow users to add a record
    to the RECORD TYPES (#195.2) file even if they do not have LAYGO
    access to the file.
  
 3. BRX-0303-10381   USER TERMINAL HUNG SINCE INSTALL OF RT*2*31
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Patch RT*2*31 (item 2) released March 4, 2003 prevented
    using an "^" to exit certain options during the creation of
    new volumes as a way to prevent newly created volumes from not
    appearing on the Trace Movement History [RT INQ-TRACE] report.
    Bronx and Salt Lake City objected to this limitation.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine RTDPA1 has been modified to allow using an "^" to exit
    these options, but to enter the initial creation event in the
    RECORD MOVEMENT HISTORY (#190.3) file regardless whether an "^"
    is used or not in the course of creating a new record in the
    RECORDS (#190) file.

   1.   Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
   2.   (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
        for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
        NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
        in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
   3.   Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
