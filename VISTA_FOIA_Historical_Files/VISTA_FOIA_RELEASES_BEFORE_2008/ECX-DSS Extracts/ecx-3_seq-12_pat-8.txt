    NEW FIELDS IN EXISTING FILES --
   
    A large number of new fields are being added to existing DSS 
    EXTRACTS files in this update.  Please consult the Extract Format &
    Data Definitions Guide for a complete description of updated 
    field definitions.
    
    
    NEW FILES --
   
    DSS DIVISION IDENTIFIER (#727.3)
    This file is used to associate a local DSS Identifier with each 
    medical center division.  Do not use FileMan to enter/edit data 
    in this file.  The DSS Site Manager is provided with a specific 
    menu option with which to perform file updates.
    
    DSS WARD (#727.4)
    This file is used to associate a DSS Department code with each 
    active ward in the medical center.  Do not use FileMan to enter/edit
    data in this file.  The DSS Site Manager is provided with a specific
    menu option with which to perform file updates.
    
    DSS PRODUCTION UNIT (#729)
    This file provides codes associated with DSS production units.  
    These codes are used when the DSS Site Manager develops DSS 
    Department codes to be associated with various medical center 
    entities such as wards.  This file is intended for read only 
    purposes.  It must not be modified in any way by the local site.
    Modifications to this file will be distributed nationally in 
    accordance with guidance provided by the DSS Bedford Technical 
    Services Office.
    
    
    NEW LAB TESTS IN FILE #727.2 --
    
    A number of laboratory tests have been added to the DSS LAB 
    TESTS file (#727.2).  They are:
   
    13  GGTP (GAMMA-GT)
    14  DILANTIN (PHENYTOIN)
    15  VALPROIC ACID
    16  CARBAMAZEPINE (TEGRETOL)
    17  HGB A1C (GLYCOSYLATED HGB A1C)
    18  ALPHA 1 TRYPSIN PROTEINASE INHIBITOR
    19  PSA (PROSTATIC SPECIFIC ANTIGEN)
    20  CD-4 (T CELL COUNT)
    21  PROTIME
    22  TOTAL THYROXINE (T-4)
    23  TOTAL TRIIODOTHYRONINE (T-3)
    24  THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH)
    25  FOLATE
    26  VITAMIN B-12 LEVEL
    27  LDLC
    28  HDLC
    29  TOTAL CHOLESTEROL
    30  TRIGLYCERIDES
    31  SERUM CREATININE
    
    Use the Link DSS Selected Lab Tests to Local Lab Tests option 
    [ECXLABRS] to associate each of the new lab entries with a local
    Laboratory test.  This will enable test results to be extracted
    in the Laboratory Results (LAR) extract.
    
    
    UPDATE TO FILE #730 --
    
    The NATIONAL SERVICE file (#730) was originally released with 
    the now obsolete INTERIM MANAGEMENT SUPPORT package.  Then 
    for a time, EVENT CAPTURE was given custodianship of the file.  
    With release of the FY1999 Update for DSS EXTRACTS v3.0, 
    custodianship is given to DSS EXTRACTS.  
   
    It is no longer advisable for sites to make local entries to
    this file.  If, however, local entries must be made to support
    an existing local initiative, care should be taken to add local
    records at an internal entry number of 1000 or above.
    
    As nationally released, file #730 contains 47 records.  In
    this patch, three new services are being added:
     
    #48  DIALYSIS
    #49  OPTOMETRY/OPHTHALMOLOGY
    #50  PODIATRY
    
    If internal entry numbers 48, 49, and 50 are already in use,
    then the post-installation routine will attempt to use other
    (higher) internal entry numbers, as long as they are less than
    1000.
    
    Two new fields, DSS SERVICE CODE (#3) and VA COST CENTER (#4),
    have been added to the file.  These fields, along with the
    NAME field (#.01), are not editable.  The Bedford Technical
    Services Office will provide additions and revisions to the
    file through nationally released patches.  Data is being 
    entered into fields #3 and #4 for most records with internal
    entry numbers from 1 through 50.
    
    A number of services with internal entry numbers between 1 and 47
    are having their #.01 field (NAME) updated:
   
    IEN     New name                 Original name
    ---     --------                 -------------
     3      ANESTHESIA               ANESTHESIOLOGY
     4      AUDIOLOGY & SPEECH       AUDIOLOGY/SPEECH PATHOLOGY
            PATHOLOGY
     5      BLIND REHABILITATION     BLIND REHAB
    12      NUTRITION AND FOOD       DIETETICS
            SERVICE
    20      PATHOLOGY &              LABORATORY
            LABORATORY MEDICINE
    22      HEALTH ADMINISTRATION    MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION
    39      PHYSICAL MEDICINE &      REHABILITATION MEDICINE
            REHABILITATION
    47      GERIATRICS & EXTENDED    EXTENDED CARE
            CARE
    
    
    NEW AND REVISED OPTIONS --
    
    ECX DSSDEPT MGMT      DSS Department Management  (NEW)
                          This menu holds the set of options needed  
                          for DSS Department management functions.  
                          It can be found on the DSS Extract Manager's
                          'Maintenance' menu. 
   
                          Each of the following options is contained in
                          the DSS Department Management menu.
                          
    ECX DIVISION ID       Enter/Edit DSS Division Identifier  (NEW)
                          This option should only be used by the DSS 
                          Site Manager to enter or edit the DSS Division 
                          Identifier associated with each medical center
                          division.  Use the single character code (either
                          numeric or alphabetic) associated with each 
                          division as in DSS/Austin.
           
    ECX DSSDEPT DECODE    Decode a DSS Department Code  (NEW)
                          This option will allow the user to enter a 
                          4-character string, which will then be 'decoded'
                          as if it were a DSS Department code.
    
                          DSS Department codes are of the format
    
                          ABBCxxx
                          where: A = DSS Clinical Service code
                                BB = DSS Production Unit code
                                 C = DSS Division Identifier code
                               xxx = suffix (optional)
     
                          Only the ABBC portion is decoded.
               
    ECX WARD DSSDEPT      Enter/Edit DSS Ward  (NEW)
                          This option should only be used by the DSS 
                          Site  Manager to enter or edit the DSS Department
                          code associated with each medical center ward.
                          Per the Bedford Technical Services Office (BTSO),
                          each ward must be assigned a clinical service
                          code of 'U' (i.e., Nursing).  The division 
                          identifier code for each ward is already known,
                          since the ward is associated with a specific
                          division in the WARD LOCATION file (#42).
                          Therefore, only the production unit code and 
                          suffix (optional) need to be entered.
              
    ECXWRD                Active MAS Wards for Fiscal Year Print  (REVISED)
                          This option prints a list of all MAS wards that  
                          were active at any time during the current 
                          fiscal year.  The list is sorted by Medical Center 
                          Division and displays the pointer to the HOSPITAL 
                          LOCATION file (#44), the service and specialty 
                          associated with the ward in the WARD LOCATION    
                          file (#42), and the DSS Department code associated
                          with the ward in the DSS WARD file (#727.4).  
                          (Note: This option will continue to appear on the
                          Setup for Inpatient Census Information menu.)

       In preparation for the installation, make a copy of the NATIONAL
       SERVICE file (#730) by copying global ^ECC(730,.  Use a system 
       utility or load the global into a MailMan message using the
       appropriate MailMan utility.  (This is done as a precaution.
       If many local modifications have been made to this file, it
       may be necessary to restore file #730 to its pre-installation
       state.)
    
    
    This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
    DSS Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been
    completed.  
    
    Installation will take less than 5 minutes, if you do not rebuild user
    menus.
    
    Note:    Once your site has installed XU*8*81, KIDS will attempt
             to rebuild all user menus.  If you are running this install
             interactively, you will be prompted for a start time for the
             menu rebuild.  If you are not running this install inter-
             actively, KIDS will start the menu rebuild immediately after
             the installation completes.  Therefore, you may wish to queue
             the installation to run at a time of low system activity
             to accommodate the menu rebuild.
    
    No harm to data will occur if the installation is performed more 
    than once.
    
    1.  From the Kernal Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation Menu.
  
         a.  Select the Load a Distribution option.
         b.  At the "Enter a Host File:" prompt enter ECX3_8.KID.
     
    2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
        ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
        from the mapped set at this time.
     
    3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation menu.  
     
    4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*8):
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
     
    5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*8.
    
    6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
        you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
        Extract Manager's Options   [ECXMGR]
   
    7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
        to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
    8.  After successful installation of this patch, the following routines
        should be deleted:
     
        ECX3P8P1   (post installation routine)
        ECX3P8P2   (post installation routine)
        ECX3P8P3   (post installation routine)
        ECX3P8PT   (post installation routine)
        ECXLABO    (obsolete)
   
    9.  Use the FileMan Print option to do a captioned printout of file #730
        (NATIONAL SERVICE).  Compare this to the printout obtained prior to
        patch installation.  If you have any concerns about the current 
        status of file #730, please contact the OCIO National Help Desk
        at 1-888-596-4357.
