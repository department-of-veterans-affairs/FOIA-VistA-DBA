Subject: REMOVAL OF WORKLOAD CAPTURE FROM REGISTRATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VACO Program Office has approved the removal of the outpatient workload 
 capture process from two Registration options.  This patch disconnects the
 outpatient workload capture from the registration process by removing the 
 checkout interview from the Disposition An Application, [DG DISPOSITION
 APPLICATION], option and open dispositions in the Disposition Log Edit, [DG 
 DISPOSITION EDIT], option.  This includes the ability to display the 
 checkout screen as well as data elements for the Classification questions,
 Procedure, Provider, Diagnosis, and Disposition Hospital Location.
 Encounter information for completed dispositions may be edited in the 
 Disposition Log Edit, [DG DISPOSITION EDIT], option.  Workload for open
 dispositions will need to be captured through PCE or Scheduling options. 
 This patch modifies routines DGDIS and DGREGE.
