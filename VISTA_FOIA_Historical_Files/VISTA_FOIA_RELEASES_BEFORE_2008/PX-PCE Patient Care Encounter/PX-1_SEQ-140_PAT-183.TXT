 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
   1) HD123432 - IBDF UTIL MAINT UTILITY PROBLEM
  
   Problem:
   =======
   An error occurred when attempting to use code PX SELECT IMMUNIZATION 
   while running Maintenance Utility for Active/Inactive Codes [IBDF 
   UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY] option for clinics, see an example below.
  
 Select OPTION NAME: IBDF REPORTS MENU       Reports and Utilities
 Select Reports and Utilities Option: MU  Maintenance Utility for 
                                          Active/Inactive Codes 
 Sort by [C]linics, [G]roups, [F]orms:  (C/G/F): CLINICS//  (Individual)
 Select Clinic: ALL// EMPLOYEE HEALTH (EVEN)
 Select another Clinic: 
 Select Type of Code to Display: 86  PX SELECT IMMUNIZATIONS      TYPE=SELECTION
          ...OK? Yes//   (Yes)
  
 Any inactive entry in the IMMUNIZATION (#9999999.14) file contributed to
 a syntax error because of the following line of code:
  TESTIMM+8 in routine PXAPIIB:
  
    I $P($G(^AUTTIMM(X,0)),"^",7) S Y=$P(^AUTTEDT(X,0),"^") K X
  
 The second global reference should have been to the IMMUNIZATION (#9999999.14)
 file and not to the EDUCATION TOPICS (#9999999.09) file.
  
   Solution:
   =========   
   The code has been corrected to refer to the same file.
  
   I $P($G(^AUTTIMM(X,0)),"^",7) S Y=$P(^AUTTIMM(X,0),"^") K X
  
 ============
   2) HD135534 - IB MT NIGHT COMP erroring out with 
                 <SUBSCRIPT>ENCEVENT+10~PXKENC
  
   Problem:
   =======
   If PCE DBIA1889-F was called and an expected VISITIEN was not passed,
   a syntax error occurred in routine PXKENC because, even if the VISITIEN is 
   a required parameter, there was no code that would stop execution in that
   situation.
  
   The current code:
  
   ENCEVENT(VISITIEN,DONTKILL) ;Create the ^TMP("PXKENC",$J, array of all the
          ;  information about one encounter.
          ;Parameters:
          ;  VISITIEN  Pointer to the Visit (#9000010)
          ;  DONOTKILL is 1 if the output array is not to be killed before used
          ;            and 0 or null if the array is to be killed (cleaned out)
          ;
          ;  The encounter is returned in the array
          ;    ^TMP("PXKENC",$J,pointer to visit)
          ;
          I '$D(^AUPNVSIT(VISITIEN)) Q
          ;
  
    evaluated VISITIEN parameter without anticipation that it could be NULL, 
    and if NULL was improperly passed then an error was generated.
  
    Solution:
    ========
    The following line of code was added to quit if NULL is passed, in the same
    way as if a invalid VISITIEN was passed:
  
  ENCEVENT(VISITIEN,DONTKILL);Create the ^TMP("PXKENC",$J, array of all the
          ;  information about one encounter.
          ;Parameters:
          ;  VISITIEN  Pointer to the Visit (#9000010)
          ;  DONOTKILL is 1 if the output array is not to be killed before used
          ;            and 0 or null if the array is to be killed (cleaned out)
          ;
          ;  The encounter is returned in the array
          ;    ^TMP("PXKENC",$J,pointer to visit)
          ;
          I $G(VISITIEN)'>0 Q  ;PX/183
          I '$D(^AUPNVSIT(VISITIEN)) Q
  
 NOTE: It is important for all subscribing packages to evaluate if the
       required VISITIEN has a valid entry in the VISIT (#9000010) file 
       but this is the current requirement of DBIA1889-F.
  
  ===========
   3) HD136528 - Warning on Patient Death
  
   Problem:
   ========
   In PCE Encounter Data Entry options (see the INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   section of patch description for list), if a patient with death remarks
   in the REMARKS (#.091) field of the PATIENT (#2) file is accessed then
   other patients were processed by switching through Action: 'SP'- Select
   New Patient, then the death remarks are randomly displayed with a
   patient to whom they do not belong.
   
   The problem was primarily caused by array segment
   DIR("A",1)="WARNING "_VADM(7) that is included with ^DIR call used to
   display the REMARKS (#.091) field, if applicable. Any action that
   killed or 'newed' DIR array before executing a new ^DIR call was working
   fine but if, for example, a new ^DIR call was made for a patient that
   did not have any remarks, then the previous patient's remarks were
   wrongly displayed.  VADM(7) represents a patient's remarks, and for the
   dead patient those remarks, for example, look something like "[PATIENT
   DIED ON 4/1/05]". Even if VADM array was properly initiated and VADM(7)
   did not contain any value, segment DIR("A",1) still existed.
  
   Solution:
   ========
   Subroutine PAT1 of routine PXCEPAT was modified to use the NEW command
   for DIR array, preventing any DIR segment from carrying over. Also in
   subroutine NEWPAT two calls to subroutine PATKILL were added for
   cleaning the processed patient data. Any patient remarks are displayed
   properly with the patient to whom they belong.
  
  ===========
   4) HD173398 - Event Capture Issue
  
   Problem:
   ========
   There are conditions under which visits have to be displayed depending on
   a PCE option being used. Users are not aware of these conditions because
   they are not included in the user documentation.  Routine PXCEPAT
   includes these conditions, and any ancillary visits are not displayed on
   PCE Encounter Data Entry [PCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY] option except PCE
   Data Entry Supervisor. The ancillary visits can be also viewed in PCE
   Encounter Viewer [PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER] option.
     
   Patient Care Encounter (PCE) V. 1.0 User Manual August 1996 Patch
   PX*1*124 (Revised September 2005), while describing PCE Encounter Data
   Entry [PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY] option does not include information
   about differences in PCE Encounter Data Entry options.
   
   It is likely this was done for a purpose not to be able to see and
   modify ancillary visits from PCE unless you have a supervisor privilege.
   In the same PXCE Supervisor menu it can be assigned to a desired,
   responsible person, not necessarily a supervisor.  PCE Encounter
   Viewer [PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER] option may be used if it is desired to
   view visits, including ancillary ones.
   
  
   Ancillary visits are identified by 'A' in the Encounter Type field of
   the Visit file. 
  
   FIELD NAME:       ENCOUNTER TYPE
  
   FLD NUMBER:       15003            
   NODE;PIECE:       150;3          
  
    DATA TYPE:       Set of Codes
                       P:PRIMARY
                       O:OCCASION OF SERVICE
                       S:STOP CODE
                       A:ANCILLARY
                       C:CREDIT STOP
  
  If the ENCOUNTER TYPE (#15003) field in the VISIT (#9000010) file entry
  is "A"- ANCILLARY  then this visit is skipped from being displayed in 
  PCE Encounter Data Entry options except option:
   PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER].
  
  This issue will be addressed by including additional information about
  PCE Encounter Data Entry options, and about 
  PCE Encounter Viewer [PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER] functionality.
  
  Please note the current description of PCE Encounter Data Entry 
  - Supervisor:
  
  "Assign PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor to users who can document
  a clinical encounter and can also delete any encounter entries, even though
  they are not the creator of the entries."
  
  As you can see there is nothing about a privilege of seeing ancillary visits
  under that option and not under someone else's.
  
  Solution:
  ========
  Patient Care Encounter (PCE) V. 1.0 User Manual August 1996 Patch PX*1*124
  (Revised September 2005) will be updated by providing modified information
  about functionality of different PCE Data Entry options.
  
  On page 73:
  
 "Assign PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor to users who can document
  a clinical encounter and can also delete any encounter entries, even though
  they are not the creator of the entries. This option allows also, contrary 
  to all other PXCE Encounter Data Entry, to display, and even modify ancillary
  encounters so it should be assigned with caution."
  
  After table 'List by Encounters', page 12 the following paragraph will
  be added:
  
 "List by Encounters includes ancillary encounters only if the process starts
  either through PCE Encounter Data Entry Supervisor or PXCE Encounter Viewer."
