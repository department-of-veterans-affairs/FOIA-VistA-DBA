 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch updates the Clinical Reminder Exchange Utility so it is
 compatible with version 1.5 of the Clinical Reminders package. Please
 refer to the documentation for a description of how the new Exchange
 Utility works. File #811.8 was previously used to store reminder types. 
 Clinical Reminders version 1.5 made reminder type obsolete so this file has 
 been changed to the Exchange File, which is central to the exchange 
 process.
  
 A. To provide sites more control over their reminders, some new
 functionality has been added.
  
 1. The new fields, CLASS and SPONSOR, have been added to the following
 Clinical Reminder files: 801.41, 811.2, 811.4, 811.5, and 811.9. CLASS is
 a set of codes:
     N - National
     V - VISN
     L - Local
 SPONSOR is a pointer to file 811.6, REMINDER SPONSOR, which previously was
 known as the REMINDER TERM SPONSOR file (it has been renamed with this
 patch). Sponsor also has a Class. The Class of the Sponsor must match the
 Class of the entry that points to the Sponsor. Once a Sponsor is in use,
 it cannot be edited.
  
 2. The new field USAGE has been added to file 811.9, REMINDER DEFINITION.
 Its purpose is to allow the reminder creator to specify how the reminder
 can be used. This is a free text field that contains any of the following
 characters:
     C - CPRS (the reminder can be used in the CPRS GUI)
     R - Reminder Reports (the reminder can be used in reminder reports)
     X - Reminder Extracts (the reminder is used for data extraction)
     * - The reminder can be used for any of the above
  
 The USAGE field is not yet used by Clinical Reminders v1.5; however, it
 is available for future functionality.
  
 B. In addition to the Exchange Utility, this patch contains fixes for some
 problems reported by NOIS and discovered during testing.
  
 1. The cross-reference on the URL field of the WEB multiple of the
 REMINDER DEFINITION file, data element 811.9002,.01, was only 30
 characters long even though the field has a maximum length of 128.
 Whenever two or more entries matched through the first 30 characters,
 selecting the correct entry was very difficult. The cross-reference has
 been changed to have the full 128 character length. Now the user will see
 the full URL. NOIS: PUG-0201-50190
     
 2. A new field CHECKBOX SEQUENCE is added to dialog prompts.
    
 Currently, comment fields are created by adding the prompt PXRM COMMENT to the
 dialog element. Each checkbox for the comment field must then be created as an
 individual prompt and added to the dialog element. This process generates a
 large number of dialog components. For dialog exchange, it is desirable to
 minimize the number of dialog components being transferred, so a new simpler
 method has been created.
    
 The PXRM COMMENT prompt is copied to a new prompt (e.g. INJECTION SITE) and
 multiple checkboxes can be added to the prompt using the new field's
 CHECKBOX SEQUENCE.
    
 e.g.
 CHECKBOX SEQUENCE     TEXT
                 1     Right Deltoid
                 2     Left Deltoid
     
     
 The new prompt (e.g. INJECTION SITE) is then added to the dialog element. 
 PXRM COMMENT is not required on the element.
      
 This does not affect dialogs created by the previous method.
     
 3. The option 'Do you want to edit now' after copying a reminder dialog is
 removed. Instead the list of dialogs for the reminder is displayed.
     
 4. Dialogs beginning with VA- or having a national class can no longer be 
 edited.
  
 5. When the patient's age did not fall in any of the age ranges specified
 in the definition, the incorrect error message "There is no reminder
 frequency" was displayed in the Clinical Maintenance output. Also IGNORE
 ON N/A set to "A" would not suppress the Clinical Maintenance output. This
 is corrected. NOIS: HUN-0401-22538.
  
 6. If a cancelled lab result came after a completed result, the cancelled 
 result was being used, making the finding false. Now lab results will be 
 scanned and the most recent result that is not cancelled or pending will be 
 used. NOIS: WAS-0501-20895, WRJ-0601-10037.
  
 7. A bug was discovered that could possibly cause some inpatient 
 medications for drug findings to be missed. This was fixed. A new field
 RXTYPE has been added to the finding multiple of file 811.5, REMINDER
 TERM, and file 811.9, REMINDER DEFINITION. This field applies only to drug
 findings and allows you to choose whether the medication is inpatient,
 outpatient, or both. The default is both, which is consistent with the
 current behavior. NOIS: MRN-0701-40393 
  
 8. If there was a hard error during reminder evaluation, the patient cache 
 may have been left locked. Code was added to PXRMERRH to make sure that the 
 patient cache gets unlocked.

  Documentation:
  ==============
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
 may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 This documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files. The
 complete Clinical Reminders Manager Manual is PXRMTM.PDF The documentation
