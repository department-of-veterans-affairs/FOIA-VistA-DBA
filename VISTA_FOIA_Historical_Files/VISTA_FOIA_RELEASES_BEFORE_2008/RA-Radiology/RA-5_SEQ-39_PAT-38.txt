 This multi-build patch contains 4 Provider Systems patches to support 
 Code Set Versioning under the Health Information Portability and 
 Accountability Act (HIPAA).  These patches are contained within a single
 KIDS build: CSV_PS_1_0.KID
  
 The four patches included in this single KIDS build are :
                   LR*5.2*297       CSV-Laboratory
                   RA*5.0*38        CSV-Radiology
                   RMPR*3.0*74      CSV-Prosthetics
                   SR*3.0*116       CSV-Surgery
  
 They contain routines, templates, and data dictionary changes to 
 recognize code sets for CPT and/or ICD9 codes.  Please refer to the 
 individual patch descriptions to get the names of documentation files.
  
 The documentation and KIDS build can be found in the following 
 [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE] directories:

 The HIPAA regulations mandate that federally recognized code sets used in 
 electronic data interchange (EDI) must accommodate translation for 
 standards development organizations (SDO) established codes according to 
 the date when the code and narrative description were established.  
  
 The data screening of code sets will be modified, to ensure that the code 
 sets are active on the date of treatment or service.  These code sets 
 include:
  
  - ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical 
 Modifications)
  
  - CPT-4 (Clinical Procedure Terminology-4)
  
  
 For the RA*5.0*38 patch:
  
 1.  Routine RACPTCSV has been added to the application to handle the
     screening of CPT Codes and CPT Modifiers during exam registration and
     editing.
  
 2.  Routine RACPTMSC has been changed to prevent inactive CPT Modifiers
     from being stuffed into an exam record during registration.  It has
     also been enhanced to determine the status of a CPT Modifier.
  
 3.  Input templates [RA EXAM EDIT] and [RA STATUS CHANGE] have been 
     changed to check an exam's CPT Code and CPT Modifiers, if the   
     it was registered with a future date.
  
 4.  File #70, RAD/NUC MED PATIENT, sub-file #70.03, EXAMINATIONS,
     sub-field #2, PROCEDURE has the data screen, DIC("S"), changed
     to add one more reason for rejection of the procedure, and to
     display only the applicable reason(s) for rejection of a procedure
     when that procedure is rejected.
  
  
 The above changes affect the following options:
  
     Add Exams to Last Visit [RA ADDEXAM]
     Case No. Exam Edit [RA EDITCN]
     Edit Exam by Patient [RA EDITPT]
     Register Patient for Exams [RA REG]
     Status Tracking of Exams [RA STATRACK]
     Procedure Enter/Edit [RA PROCEDURE]
     Location Parameter Set-up [RA SYSLOC]
