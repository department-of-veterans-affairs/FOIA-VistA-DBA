This patch addresses the appointment blocking for domiciliary patients.
"BLD",4048,1,2,0)
The blocking API is modified to treat DOM patients as inpatients.  This
"BLD",4048,1,3,0)
patch also corrects a problem in the Automated MT Report and makes a 
"BLD",4048,1,4,0)
modification for DCD sites when the letters are initially set up in the
"BLD",4048,1,5,0)
letter status file.'

"RTN","EASMTCHK",4,0)
 ; for the blocking of future appointments and appointment check-in/out if the patient 
"RTN","EASMTCHK",5,0)
