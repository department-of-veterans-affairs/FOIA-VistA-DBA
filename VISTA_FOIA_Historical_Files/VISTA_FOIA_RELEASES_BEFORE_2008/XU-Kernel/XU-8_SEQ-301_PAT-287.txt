Subject: New Person / Inactive facility

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the INPUT TRANSFORM of the DIVISION (#.01) field of the 
 DIVISION (#16) multiple of the NEW PERSON (#200) file.  This prevents users 
 in the NEW PERSON (#200) file from being associated with an inactive / 
 non-treating facility.  See NOIS (CPH-0202-40674).
  
 Holders of the XUMGR security key may override the input transform and 
 assign other facility types (other than medical) as "divisions" to a User.
