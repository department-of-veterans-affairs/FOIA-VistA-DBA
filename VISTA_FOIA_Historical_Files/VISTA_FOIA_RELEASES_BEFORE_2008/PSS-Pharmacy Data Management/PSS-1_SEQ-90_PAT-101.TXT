Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2 APIS FOR PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will be 
 used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
 writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.  Since the PHARMACY PATIENT 
 file (#55) and PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) are being replaced as part of 
 the Pharmacy Re-engineering project, any direct M-based global reads or 
 writes to these files must be replaced by calling the APIs provided in 
 this patch. When the new data source is in place, the calling 
 applications will not be required to make any changes, because these APIs 
 will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested data from the new data 
 source, when the time comes.
  
 These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
 direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
 replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 5 minutes.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*101).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*101.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
