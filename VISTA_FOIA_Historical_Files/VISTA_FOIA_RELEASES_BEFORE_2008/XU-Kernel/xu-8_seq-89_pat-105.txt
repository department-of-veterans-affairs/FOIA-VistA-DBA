Run Date: NOV 25, 1998                     Designation: XU*8*105

Subject: Cleanup and Identification of Dangling Pointers with County Codes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Patch XU*8*105 is designed to identify and correct two data problems
 associated with the following files: 
  
       1. Patient (File #2)
       2. Fee Basis Vendor (File #161.2)
       3. Person (File #16) 
       4. HBHC Patient (File #631)
  
 The two problems being addressed and corrected with this patch are
 described below:
  
      1.  Dangling pointers associated with the County Fields in the
 aforementioned files are identified and cleaned up.  (set to null)
  
      2.  State and County entries that are currently null are identified
 and listed as exceptions.   The exceptions are listed in the temporary
 global ^XTMP("XUXTMP")  This is a new temporary global created by the
 patch.  These exceptions are identified to provide a list of current state
 and county entry errors at each site.  They will need to be addressed on a
 site-to-site basis.
  
 These problems were discovered during installation of patch XU*DBA*3,
 which was an effort to cleanup some entries in the County and State codes
 in the State File.
  
 Once your site installs this patch, you must run the routine ^XUXCTY. This
 routine performs the identification and cleanup of these exceptions.  When
 this routine has run to completion, the temporary global ^XTMP("XUXTMP")
 will exist at your site.  This global contains the zero node of all
 records found that were either changed or that contain exceptions to be
 addressed.   The global looks like this:
  
 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",0) = 2981106^2981030
 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",1) = PATIENT FILE RECORDS CLEANED
 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",2) = BLOW,JOE P.^M^2350303^E^6^6^MEDICINE^99^444556677^THIS

 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",9) =

 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",12) = 
 ^XTMP("XUXTMP",13) = HBHC PATIENT FILE RECORDS CLEANED
  
  
 Sites can use the routine ^XUXPRT to print this new global. It may be
 quite large, thus your site may want to queue the job for later.  Once the
 hardcopy of ^XTMP("XUXTMP") has been printed, your site can use the
 FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to enter the correct State
 and/or County data.

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take
 less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. New routines will not be mapped.
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options as desired:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
  
 4. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
     option to install the patch:
         Install Package(s) (XU*8.0*105)
  
 5. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'NO'. 
  
 6. Routines were not unmapped as part of step 2, because these are new 
    routines.
  
  
 Post Installation
 =================
  
 NOTE:  GLOBAL ^XTMP("XUXTMP") WILL ONLY EXIST ON YOUR SYSTEM FOR SEVEN
 DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU RUN THE ROUTINE ^XUXCTY.  THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT
 THAT YOU RUN THE PRINT ROUTINE PRIOR TO THE KILL DATE FOR THIS TEMP
 GLOBAL.  IF YOU MISS HOWEVER, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS RERUN THE ROUTINE
 ^XUXCTY.
  
  
 Once your site installs this patch, you must execute the following to
 fully implement the desired functionalitY:
  
     1  Go into programmers mode D ^XUP
  
     2  From programmers mode run the routine ^XUXCTY.  D ^XUXCTY
 This routine will perform the identification and cleanup of these
 exceptions
  
     3  Examine the global ^XTMP("XUXTMP") which now exists at your site.
 To examine the global, its best to use D ^%G.  This global contains the
 zero node of all the records found to be exceptions or that were changed.
  
     4  Sites use routine ^XUXPRT to print the global.  The global maybe
 quite large, thus your site may want to queue the job for later. 
  
     5  Once the  hardcopy of ^XTMP("XUXTMP") has been printed, use the 
 FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to enter the correct State
 and/or County data.
