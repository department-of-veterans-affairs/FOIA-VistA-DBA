  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

    
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 1. NOIS POR-1299-50501
  
 Problem:
 Site reports that their DOL District Office will not accept the CA1 or CA2
 form that is printed with the ASISTS software. They advise that the REV.
 Date on the bottom of the form is SEPT 1993 and that there are newer ones.
 The DOL has revised the CA-1 and CA-2 and both forms now look different
 from the current ones printed by the ASISTS software.
  
 Resolution:
 The routines that control the printing of the CA1 and CA2 were
 modified to print the CA1 and CA2 in the latest format produced by the
 DOL. For the CA-1 the Version Date is Apr. 1999, and for the CA-2 the
 version Date is Jan. 1997. After installation of this patch, the 
 correct version of the CA1/CA2 form will be generated by the computer
 and can be verified by checking the date at the bottom of the form.
 Use option Print CA1/CA2 [OOPS EMP PRINT CA], [OOPS SUP PRINT CA], and 
 [OOPS SAFETY PRINT CA] to print a blank CA1 or CA2.
  
 2. NOIS MAC-0200-61022
  
 Problem:
 TaskMan errors when user queues CA1 or CA2 for printing.
  
 Resolution:
 Modified code in routine OOPSPCA to clear page and form feed prior to
 closing print device.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following E3Rs:
  
 1. 11905 Edit Stub Record
  
 Problem:
 Once a stub record has been created and saved, it is not possible to edit
 this stub record. In order to make corrections to the stub record, the
 status has to be changed to "deleted" and a new record has to be created.
  
 Resolution:
 A new menu option and a new routine were created to address the problem.
 The new option Edit Stub Record [OOPS EDIT STUB RECORD] will allow editing
 of unsigned stub records by the Safety Officer and Employee Health.
 Selection of this new option from the ASISTS Safety Officer Menu [OOPS
 SAFETY MENU] and ASISTS Employee Health Menu [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU] will
 allow editing of the following fields in File #2260 (ASISTS ACCIDENT
 REPORTING FILE):
  
   1.  TYPE OF INCIDENT (fld #3)
   2.  DATE OF BIRTH (fld #6)
   3.  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (fld #5)
   4.  SEX (fld #7)
   5.  HOME STREET ADDRESS (fld #8)
   6.  CITY (fld #9)
   7.  STATE (fld #10)
   8.  ZIP CODE (fld #11)
   9.  HOME PHONE NUMBER (fld #12)
   10. STATION NUMBER (fld #13)
   11. SUPERVISOR (fld #53)
   12. SECONDARY SUPERVISOR (fld #53.1)
  
 2. 11747 Display CA1/CA2
  
 Problem:
 Currently the information on the CA1 and CA2 cannot be viewed on a CRT
 monitor or printed to a non-HP PCL level 5 compatible printer.  In order
 to view a CA1 or a CA2 a hardcopy must be printed.  This causes
 unnecessary time and/or use of paper if the user just wants to view the
 CA1 or CA2.
  
 Resolution:
 A new menu option Display CA1 or CA2 [DISPLAY CA1 OR CA2] and new routine was
 created to address this issue.  Upon installation of this patch, the users
 will now have the ability to print CA1/CA2 to a non-HP PCL Level 5
 compatible printer in report format.  The users will also be able to view
 a CA1 or a CA2 on screen without having to print a hardcopy.  The new
 option will be available on the following menus:
  
    ASISTS Employee Menu           [OOPS EMP MENU]       
    ASISTS Employee Health Menu    [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU]
    ASISTS Safety Officers Menu    [OOPS SAFETY MENU]     
    ASISTS Supervisor Menu         [OOPS SUP MENU]       
  
 3. 12709 Reason for Case Deletion
  
 Problem:
 This E3R requested that a REASON FOR DELETION (new field #58) be collected
 whenever the Case Status was changed to Deleted in the Change the Status
 of a Case [OOPS SAFETY CLOSE] Option.
  
 Resolution:
 The option, Change the Status of a Case [OOPS SAFETY CLOSE] has been
 modified to prompt the user to enter a REASON FOR DELETION (ASISTS
 ACCIDENT REPORTING FILE #2260, FIELD #58) whenever a Case Status of
 'Deleted' is entered.  This a non-mandatory, free text field with a
 maximum length of 30 characters.
  
 4. The following menu options have been added to the [OOPS EMP HEALTH
 MENU] ASISTS Employee Health Menu:
  
 Display CA1/CA2                                [OOPS EMP HLT DISP CA1/CA2]
 Edit Stub Record                               [OOPS EMP HLT EDIT STUB]
 Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and       [OOPS LOG]
     Illness
 Log of Needlestick Incidents                   [OOPS NEEDLESTICK LOG]
 Print Accident Report Status                   [OOPS SAFETY PRINT STATUS]
 Print CA1/CA2                                  [OOPS SAFETY PRINT CA]
 Print Report of Accident                       [OOPS SAFETY PRINT]
