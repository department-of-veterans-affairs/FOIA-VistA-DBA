Run Date: MAR 16, 1999                     Designation: GMRC*3*2
Package : GMRC - CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING     Priority: Mandatory
Version : 3         SEQ #2                     Status: Released

Subject: RELINK CONSULT AND CPRS PROTOCOLS

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  
  This patch corrects the break in communication between CPRS and Consults
  which exists after the CPRS V1.0/CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING V3.0
  installation.  The result of the break in communication is that orders
  signed and released from CPRS are not being sent to Consults, and
  Consults cannot send any tracking status updates to CPRS.
  
  1) This patch restores the protocol menu items for GMRC EVSEND OR and
  GMRC ORDERABLE ITEM UPDATE. This corrects the package value and links the
  OR menu items needed to link CPRS and the CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING
  package.
  
  2) This patch corrects the FILE LINK variable pointer value in the
  PROTOCOL file (101) for procedure protocol entries that are prefixed with
  "GMRCR ".  The FILE LINK variable pointer value is a Service from the
  REQUEST SERVICES file (123.5). This is done as part of the post
  installation.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded as soon as possible after CPRS V1 has
  been successfully loaded.  It should be run before letting users back on
  the system after the CPRS V1 install. The installation will take about 2
  minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
    
    2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   
    3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*2):
        a.  Backup a Transport Global           
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System           
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option. When prompted for INSTALL NAME:
       use GMRC*3.0*2
    
    5. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
  
  POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===============================
    1. During the post-install, some GMRCR prefixed protocols may not have
       the FILE LINK field resolved correctly. This is usually due to
       changes made to file 123.5.
    2. Those protocols that could not be corrected automatically will
       appear in the text of the install file entry for this patch.
    3. To insure that each procedure type protocol is related to the proper
       service from file 123.5, the following option on the Consult
       Management menu should be used to review/correct the RELATED CONSULT
       SERVICE/SPECIALTY.
  
       NOTE: Not all of the GMRCR protocols will have a RELATED CONSULT
       SERVICE/SPECIALTY. This generally means that this protocol is not
       in use at your site.
