Description: 
============

 This patch will correct a number of potential problems                     
 relating to the year 2000. 
                                                                         
 Routine: MCARAM2                                                            
                                                                        
 In the routine MCARAM2, the code checks if the date transferred from the
 MUSE to the local is a two digit year, a "19" is concatenated to the two
 digit year.  This would be wrong in the year 2000.  Routine MCARAM2 will
 now reject two digit year date with the error message "52-Date/Time not
 DD-MMM-YYY@HH:MM" so any 1900 lab data transferred in year 2000 cannot
 become confused with 2000.                                               
                                                                          
 Routine: MCARAP, MCARGES, and MCARPACE                                    
                                                                            
 A "P" is added to %DT variable so when VA Fileman's %DT utility
 is used it will assume past dates.                                             
                                                                           
 Routine: MCBPFTP1, MCARHP, MCARP1, MCARPAL, and MCPFTP1                       
                                                                             
 The Date of Birth on the Medicine reports now contains the        
 complete four digit year so 1900 cannot become confused with 2000.          
                                                                              
 The Date of Birth displayed on the Rheumatology Patient background info
 screen in the option Add NEW visit/display Patient Background Info.,
 [MCRHBACKF], will still contain the two digit year since the information
 displayed on the screen come from file 2, The Patient file.
                                                                             
                                                                             
  
 While a number of instances remain in which a two-digit year 
 is printed on various reports, none would appear to have a potential
 for confusion to users as to which century is involved.  Thus, routines
 MCPSOP, MCARDPL, MCARP, MCARSRP, MCBPFTP2, and MCPFTP2 were assessed
 for renovation but not needed.  Routines MCARGES, and MCARPACE were
 included in this patch since further assessment revealed that they needed
 renovation.                                                                 
                                                                             
 This patch is intended to resolve all known year-2000 issues 
 for Medicine.
