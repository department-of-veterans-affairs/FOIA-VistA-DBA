 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 This patch, DG*5.3*518, and associated patch, EAS*1*34, introduce 
 enhancements to the VistA Enrollment Application System, needed to 
 support the Millennium Healthcare and Benefit Act, Public Law 106-117 
 Section 101.  This law defines the application of copayments for veterans 
 receiving Long Term Care (LTC) services.  These patches represent Phase 
 III of the Long Term Care Copayments project and will address the 
 following requirements:
  
 1. Allow the addition of a new LTC Copayment Test for the veteran at any 
 time, including multiple tests within the same year.
  
 2. Allow the entry of burial and funeral expenses for veterans with no 
 spouse or dependant.
  
 3. Allow the entry of expenses greater than total income on the input 
 screen for the LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC).
  
 4. Enable a user to delete a LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC) or edit the 
 date of a LTC Copayment Test if the user has been assigned the 
 appropriate security key (DG MTDELETE).
  
 5. Display the veteran's LTC copayment status and last test date on the 
 following Registration screens: Load/Edit, Patient Inquiry, and Register 
 a Patient.  If the test is more than a year old, the message "**NEW TEST 
 REQUIRED**" is also displayed.  If the veteran did not agree to pay the 
 copayments, a message is displayed that indicates that the veteran is 
 ineligible for LTC services.
  
 6. Prevent the entry of a LTC Copayment Test for a patient who is not a 
 veteran.
  
 7. Correct the display of the Declines to Provide Financial Information 
 field to include both the "YES" and "NO" responses when the LTC Copayment 
 Test is displayed. 
  
 8. Modify the Calculated LTC Copayments report to correctly display the 
 maximum copayment amounts for veterans who refuse to pay the copayment.
  
 9. Correct the determination of the LTC Copayment status when a veteran's 
 income is $0.  The LTC Copayment status will be Exempt.  This change will 
 address the NOIS call MAC-1102-61792.
