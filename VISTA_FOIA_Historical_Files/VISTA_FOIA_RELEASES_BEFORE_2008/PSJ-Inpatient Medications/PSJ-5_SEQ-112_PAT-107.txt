Subject: NON-VA MEDS (HERBAL/OTC) AND BILLING AWARENESS PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
 requires that patients' use of Over-The-Counter (OTC) medications, herbal
 supplements, medications prescribed by Veterans Health Administration 
 (VHA) but purchased by the patient at an outside pharmacy, and medications
 prescribed by providers outside VHA be documented in patients' medical
 records. These four categories of medications will hereafter be referred
 to as Non-VA Meds. This patch lays the foundation necessary for Inpatient 
 Medications V. 5.0 to support Non-VA Meds but does not deliver Non-VA
 Meds functionality.  Non-VA Meds functionality will be provided in patch
 OR*3*190.
  
 2. To accommodate Billing Awareness, it was necessary to modify the 
 communication between Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and
 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to include new diagnosis codes. Inpatient
 Medications V. 5.0 routes all pharmacy orders to the appropriate package.
 This patch makes the changes necessary to pass the new diagnosis codes to
 the appropriate package.
