   The purpose of this patch is to put into effect the revisions in Public
   Law 103-322 which concerns Section 641 and Section 661 of Statute 18 of
   the United States Code.  These revisions increase the threshold for 
   felony theft of either government or personal property to $1000.  The 
   effective date of the increased threshold was October 1, 1997.
   
   **  IMPORTANT  **
   
       After the conversion of the ESP OFFENSE REPORT file (#912) 
       records affected by this patch has been completed, the Crime 
       Statistics Report for each month since October 1, 1997, must 
       be regenerated.  Detailed instructions appear below.
   
   
   Many options in the Police & Security package are affected by this change,
   especially those involved in the input/output of offense reports.
   
   (1) Patch ES*1*22 includes the following modifications to files and
       data dictionaries.
   
       (a) An update to two records in the ESP OFFENSE CODES file (#915):
   
       Record #55 - THEFT-GOVERNMENT PROPERTY
       Record #56 - THEFT-PERSONAL PROPERTY
   
       The DEFINITION field (#10) of each record is updated to reflect
       the $1000 threshold for felony theft.
   
       (b) Four new entries are made to the ESP CRIME SUB-TYPES file 
       (#912.9):
       
       Record #39 - ABOVE $1000 (GOV'T)
       Record #40 - BELOW $1000 (GOV'T)
       Record #41 - ABOVE $1000 (PERSONAL)
       Record #42 - BELOW $1000 (PERSONAL)
   
       (c) A new field is added to the ESP CRIME SUB-TYPES file (#912.9):
   
       Field #1 - INACTIVATION DATE
   
       This is a VA FileMan date/time field which will now allow a 
       record in file #912.9 to be inactivated, if it is considered  
       no longer valid after a particular date.
   
       (d) Using the new INACTIVATION DATE field, four entries in the 
       ESP CRIME SUB-TYPES file (#912.9) are being inactivated with a 
       date of October 1, 1997:
   
       Record #23 - ABOVE $100 (GOV'T)
       Record #24 - BELOW $100 (GOV'T)
       Record #25 - ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL)
       Record #26 - BELOW $100 (PERSONAL)
   
       (e) Four new fields are being added to the ESP CRIME DATA file
       (#912.4) in its INSTITUTION sub-file (#912.41) as follows:
   
       Field #133.1 - $1000 & ABOVE (GOV'T)
       Field #134.1 - <$1000 (GOV'T)
       Field #138.1 - $1000 & ABOVE (PERSONAL)
       Field #139.1 - <$1000 (PERSONAL)
    
       These fields will be used to hold the count for the each of the
       new subtypes described in (d) when the Generate Crime Statistics
       [ESP GENERATE CRIME STATISTICS] option is run.
    
       (f) A new screen is placed on the SUBTYPE field (#.03) of the
       CLASSIFICATION CODE multiple field (#10) of the ESP OFFENSE
       REPORT file (#912).  The screen will prevent selection of any
       record in file #912.9 which has an INACTIVATION DATE prior to
       the date on which the offense is reported.
   
   (2) It will create a new entry in the OPTION file (#19) for the
       user(s) responsible for overseeing the conversion process.  The
       new option is Conversion Management for ES*1*22 [ESP CONVERSION
       FOR ES*1*22].  It is a temporary option, and should be placed on
       the user's Secondary Menu.  This option provides the user with
       the ability to:
   
       (a) Print reports regarding file #912 records which have been
       converted or which require conversion.
     
       (b) Manually convert any file #912 record which requires
       conversion, or to re-convert any file #912 record which was
       automatically converted.
   
       (c) Complete the conversion process which effectively removes
       the special conversion management functions from the system.
    
   (3) Several new routines distributed with the patch are to be used
       in conversion of the ESP OFFENSE REPORT file (#912).  Conversion
       of data is needed for those offense reports entered between 
       October 1, 1997, and the date on which patch ES*1*22 is installed.
   
       (a) Routine ESP122PT is a post-installation routine which will
       invoked during the KIDS install of the patch.  It will handle
       automatic conversion of as much data in file #912 as possible.
       Automatic conversion consists of the following cases:
   
          (i) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has a classification code with a subtype of BELOW $100 (GOV'T)
          will be converted to a subtype of BELOW $1000 (GOV'T).
   
          (ii) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has a classification code with a subtype of BELOW $100 
          (PERSONAL) will be converted to a subtype of BELOW $1000
          (PERSONAL).
            
          (iii) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has only a single classification code, and if its subtype is 
          ABOVE $100 (GOV'T), and if the total dollar loss specified in
          the PROPERTY (LOST) multiple field (#90) is less than $1000,
          then the subtype will be converted to BELOW $1000 (GOV't).
    
          (iv) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has only a single classification code, and if its subtype is 
          ABOVE $100 (GOV'T), and if the total dollar loss specified in
          the PROPERTY (LOST) multiple field (#90) is more than $1000,
          then the subtype will be converted to ABOVE $1000 (GOV't).
   
          (v) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has only a single classification code, and if its subtype is 
          ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL), and if the total dollar loss specified
          in the PROPERTY (LOST) multiple field (#90) is less than $1000,
          then the subtype will be converted to BELOW $1000 (PERSONAL).
   
          (vi) Any offense report (i.e., any record in file #912) which
          has only a single classification code, and if its subtype is 
          ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL), and if the total dollar loss specified
          in the PROPERTY (LOST) multiple field (#90) is more than $1000,
          then the subtype will be converted to ABOVE $1000 (PERSONAL).
  
      (b) Routine ESP122PT will track all converted file #912 records 
      and subrecords in temporary global storage area.  It will also track
      all file #912 records and subrecords which require conversion, but
      which could not be automatically converted; these records and 
      subrecords need user review and manual conversion.
      
      (c) Routine ESP122P2 will provide the user with the ability to review
      and convert any file #912 record requiring manual conversion.  But it
      will also allow the user to re-convert any record which was automati-
      cally converted, if the user does not agree with the subtype assigned 
      during automatic conversion.
     
      (d) Routine ESP122P1 will provide the user with listing of all records
      in file #912 which have been converted (either automatically or 
      manually), and all those still requiring user review and conversion.
     
      (e) Routine ESP122P3 will be used to 'complete' the conversion process.
      When the user decides to complete the conversion process, the following
      will occur:
   
         (i) A final report of all converted records is printed.  It will
         also display the name of the user who completed the conversion 
         process and the date/time of the completion.
     
         (ii) A final report of all records (if any) which were identified
         as requiring conversion, but were not manually converted by the
         user.  It will also display the name of the user who completed
         the conversion process and the date/time of the completion.
  
         (iii) It will send a MailMan message to members of the ESP 
         VACO 48 HR CRITERIA mail group stating that the conversion process
         has been completed.
   
         (iv) It will send a MailMan message to IRM staff, through either
         the IRM or PATCHES mail group, stating that the conversion has been
         completed.  It will instruct IRM to delete the ESP122P* routines
         from the system.
   
         (v) It will place the Conversion Management option [ESP CONVERSION
         FOR ES*1*22] out-of-service.
   
         (vi) It will delete all data held in temporary global storage
         that provides information about file #912 records which have either
         been converted or require conversion.
   
   (4) A new extrinsic function, SUBTYPE, was added to routine ESPUTIL.
       This function will be used in the FileMan screen on the SUBTYPE
       field (#.03) of the CLASSIFICATION CODE multiple field (#10) of
       the ESP OFFENSE REPORT file (#912).
    
   (5) Segments of routines ESPUCR and ESPUCR4 have been modified in order
       to collect data on each of the four new subtypes added to the
       ESP CRIME SUB-TYPES file (#912.9).  These routines are used in the
       Generate Crime Statistics [ESP GENERATE CRIME STATISTICS] option.
    
   (6) Routine ESPUCP3 has been modified in order to print statistics on
       the four new crime subtypes when using the Print Crime Report
       [ESP PRINT CRIME REPORT] option.  If the Crime Report entry in 
       the ESP CRIME DATA file (#912.4) has a BEGINNING DATE field (#.01)
       prior to October 1, 1997, then thefts of government and personal
       property will be shown under the old classification of <$100 and
       >$100.  If the Crime Report entry in file #912.4 has a field #.01
       which is October 1, 1997, or later, then thefts of government 
       and personal property will be shown under the new classification
       of <$1000 and >$1000.
    
   (7) Finally, changes to routine ESPOID are also being distributed in
       this patch.  This update was requested by the National Database
       Integration team, and will provide a consistent format for internal
       entry numbers in file #912.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. However, since 
   a file conversion is involved, it is preferable to perform the 
   installation during a period of low user activity, or to queue the
   installation for after normal business hours.
   
   Warning: Once your site has installed XU*8*81, KIDS will attempt
            to rebuild all user menus.  If you are running this install
            interactively, you will be prompted for a start time for the
            menu rebuild.  If you are not running this install inter-
            actively, KIDS will start the menu rebuild immediately after
            the installation completes.  Therefore, you may wish to queue
            the installation to run at a time of low system activity
            to accommodate the menu rebuild.
   
   No harm to data will occur if the installation is performed more 
   than once.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*22):
   
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*22.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
            Police Chief              [ESP POLICE CHIEF MENU]
            Police Officer            [ESP POLICE OFFICER MENU]
            Police Supervisor         [ESP POLICE SUPERVISOR]
   
   7.  It may be advisable to specify a print device on which to run the
       installation, so that a hardcopy is made of the file update messages
       which are displayed during the post-installation.
   
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
   9.  Two conversion reports will be printed about 10 minutes after the
       installation is completed.   Please see that the Police & Security
       package manager/ADPAC at your site receives these reports.
   
       You will be prompted for a print device for these reports in a
       pre-installation question.  The reports may be printed on any
       system printer, other than a slaved print device.
       
       If for some reason the queueing fails or the reports are lost,
       then advise the Police & Security ADPAC (or whomever is assigned
       the ESP CONVERSION FOR ES*1*22 option) to print the reports using
       the print utility provided in the Conversion Management for ES*1*22
       option.
   
  10.  Assign the new Police & Security option, Conversion Management 
       for ES*1*22 [ESP CONVERSION FOR ES*1*22], to the appropriate user(s)
       responsible for Police & Security package management.  Place the
       option on the user's Secondary Menu using the Edit an Existing User
       [XUSEREDIT] option.

   Explanation:
   ===========
   
   Option 1 - Allows you to print a listing of all records in the ESP 
              OFFENSE REPORT file (#912) which have already been  
              converted, or all that need to be reviewed for possible
              'manual' conversion.
    
              The list of converted records includes those which were
              converted 'automatically' during the patch installation 
              process, as well as which were converted 'manually' by 
              the user.
    
   Option 2 - Allows you to 'manually' convert any record in file #912. 
              You may select any record in file #912 which was previously 
              converted either automatically or manually, or any record 
              which has been identified as needing review/conversion.  
              Use the reports from Option 1 to assist you in this process.
              
   
   Option 3 - Once you and other Police & Security service management 
              staff are satisfied that all offense report records in 
              file #912 have been successfully converted, use this 
              option to 'complete' the conversion process.
   
   
   The conversion process involves identifying all offense reports (i.e., 
   records in file #912) which are dated between October 1, 1997, and the 
   day on which patch ES*1*22 is installed, and which are classified as 
   a theft of government or personal property.  Conversion consists of 
   updating the SUBTYPE field (#.03) of the CLASSIFICATION CODE multiple
   field (#10) for a given record in the ESP OFFENSE REPORT file (#912).
   The following subtype classifications require conversion:
     
             ABOVE $100 (GOV'T)
             BELOW $100 (GOV'T)
             ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL)
             BELOW $100 (PERSONAL)
   
   After installation of patch ES*1*22, these subtypes cannot be 
   selected to classify offense reports dated after October 1, 1997.  
   However, for offense reports dated before October 1, 1997, these 
   subtypes will remain valid.
     
   During patch installation, many of your facility's offense reports  
   were converted immediately (i.e., automatic conversion).  These 
   include:
      
                                        Converted to
                                        ------------
             BELOW $100 (GOV'T)         BELOW $1000 (GOV'T)
    
             BELOW $100 (PERSONAL)      BELOW $1000 (PERSONAL)
     
   The following conversions take place automatically only if there
   is a single classification code for the offense record:
   
                                        Converted to
                                        ------------
             ABOVE $100 (GOV'T)         ABOVE $1000 (GOV'T)
             and total dollar loss
             is >$1000
    
             ABOVE $100 (GOV'T)         BELOW $1000 (GOV'T)
             and total dollar loss
             is <$1000
     
             ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL)      ABOVE $1000 (PERSONAL)
             and total dollar loss
             is >$1000
    
             ABOVE $100 (PERSONAL)      BELOW $1000 (PERSONAL)
             and total dollar loss
             is <$1000
    
   In all remaining cases, i.e., where the total loss of property in 
   dollars is not known, or where the offense report has multiple 
   classification codes, the record must be reviewed on an individual
   basis.
   
   After review, Option 2 may be used to convert the classification 
   of an offense report record.  However, Option 2 may also be used
   to re-convert any offense report record that was already converted 
   automatically.  There is no limit on how many times a record may 
   be converted manually.  Police & Security managers are the final 
   arbiters in this conversion process.
   
   When Police & Security management is satisfied that the conversion 
   of all affected reords is complete and accurate, use Option 3 to 
   finalize the process.  Once Option 3 has been used, no further 
   modification of offense report records can be made using these 
   special Conversion Management for ES*1*22 utilities.
   
   **IMPORTANT**
   
   After conversion is complete, the Crime Statistics report for each 
   month since October 1, 1997, **must** be regenerated.  Use the 
   Generate Crime Statistics [ESP GENERATE CRIME STATISTICS] option 
   to accomplish this.
