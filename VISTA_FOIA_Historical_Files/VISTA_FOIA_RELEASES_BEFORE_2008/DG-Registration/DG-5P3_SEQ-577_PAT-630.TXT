Subject: FIX FUTURE DATED LTC TEST LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The system will incorrectly report to the user that there is a future 
 means test on file even though it is impossible to have a future dated 
 LTC means test.  If there is a non-LTC future means test on file already, 
 the user may see the message 'A future means test already exists on 
 (date)' when trying to add a new LTC Copay Exemption Means test.
 The module that produces the data behind this message is called
 throughout the system and will return the data associated with the
 future non-LTC means test as a future test.
  
 The FUT^DGMTU module will be modified to not return the information on a
 future means test if the means test type that you are querying is a LTC
 test (means test of type 4).
