Subject: CHANGE TO HL7 ADT-A24 AND ADT-A43 MESSAGE PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE: The functionality in this patch supports the Department of
  Defense (DOD) Clinical Health Data Repository (CHDR) project.
  This patch must be installed at all facilities before updates
  to the Health Level Seven (HL7) ADT-A24 and ADT-A43 messaging
  can occur for CHDR on the Master Patient Index (MPI).
  INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT: From the date of release, RG*1*42
  has a 7-day installation compliance date.
   
  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating
  Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*6 and RG*1.0*27 are required builds for patch RG*1*42.
   
  Message format changes.
  In preparation for updating the Master Patient Index (MPI) Health
  Level Seven (HL7) maintenance messaging, routine changes have been
  made.  A variable has now been added to routine RGADTP1 that is needed
  by the ADT-A24 messaging.  A change in RGDRM02 turns off the erroneous
  generation of an outbound MFN-M05 treating facility update message that
  previously occurred during the processing of a duplicate record merge
  at the local facility.  These are technical modifications to address
  issues related to the identification of local records with the local
  identifier if passed.  These changes will not affect users of the
  VistA system.
