Description:
============

  This patch provides a new HL7 messaging engine called HL7 Optimized
  (HLO).  HLO is almost totally new and provides much greater
  performance.
  
  Although HLO is a patch to version 1.6 of the HL7 package, it will not
  replace the original HL7 engine.  Instead, sites will continue to run
  the original HL7 engine so that existing applications may run without
  change. New HL7 messaging applications will be designed to utilize
  HLO, so sites must run HLO as well as the original HL7 engine.
  
  Where necessary to improve performance, application development teams
  may convert existing applications to utilize HLO, but conversion is
  not mandated. 
  
  HLO includes:
  
   1. A new messaging engine. It will utilize the existing links from the HL
      Logical Link file (#870), but will operate on a port 5001 for production
      systems and 5026 for test systems.
   2. A new set of APIs for developers of messaging applications.
   3. A new set of options for monitoring the state of the messaging system and
    for viewing messages.
  
  A complete description of the new HLO software is provided in several
  supplemental documents, see the 'Supplemental Documentation' 
  Section below for directions on obtaining the documentation. 
  
  
  No NOIS addressed.

  Installation Instructions (takes fewer than 10 minutes):
  =========================
    1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2. Create and map new globals. This patch defines five new globals as
       listed in the following table. These globals may need to be created
       and mapped prior to patch installation depending on storage
       requirements at the individual site.
  
       Using the appropriate global management utility (i.e. %GLOMAN or the GUI
       Cache Configuration Manager), create these globals and assign the
       following global access privileges: System = RWD (or RWP), World =
       RWD (or RWP), Group = RWD (or RWP) and UCI = RWD (or RWP).  This may
       require assistance from a system manager.

    3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    4.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
        MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following
       'Installation' menu options in the order shown below:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
  
        When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
        the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
        questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
        shown below.

    5.  Follow the instructions found in Section 5 of the Installation 
        Manual for instructions on how to complete the setup of the new HL7 
        messaging engine. Setup includes additional steps for scheduling new
        options, for installing a new TCP/IP listener, and for starting the 
        new messaging engine.
