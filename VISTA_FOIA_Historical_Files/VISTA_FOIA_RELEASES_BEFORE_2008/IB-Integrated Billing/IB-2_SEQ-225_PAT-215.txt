Description:
============

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **NOTE: PATCHES EAS*1*47 AND IVM*2*96 MUST BE INSTALLED PRIOR TO THIS PATCH!
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Patches EAS*1*47 and IVM*2*96 change the way IVM Billing/Collection Data
 Transmission (ORU~Z09) HL7 messages are sent to the HEC, and to the EDB
 (New Enrollment Database). Previously, the system grouped all transactions
 closed into one HL7 Z09 message which can only contain one Means Test Income
 Year. This has the effect of reporting all billing into one Income Year.
 These patches will break up the transactions into multiple Z09 messages by
 Income Year, which will properly report them with the correct Income Year.
  
 This patch is being released as EMERGENCY at the recommendation of the
 Office of Inspector General (OIG), in order to enforce compliance with VHA
 DIRECTIVE 1909 dated February 25, 2003, which states "The health care 
 facility staff where the veteran received care is responsible for billing
 converted cases within 60 days of notification from HEC."
  
 Currently, the billing on Income Verification Match (IVM) referrals does
 not occur until there is a manual intervention. There is concern that
 referrals from the HEC are not reviewed in a timely manner by the VAMCs,
 and potential reimbursement is lost.
   
 The purpose of this patch is to automatically search, on a nightly basis,
 through entries in file INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350) for charges
 that have been in a Pending Review status for at least 60 days. These
 charges will then be released to the Accounts Receivable (AR), and Income
 Verification Match (IVM) packages without user intervention.
  
 The routines in this patch involved with the enhancement are:
  
 IBAMTC - This nightly background job, Queue Means Test Compilation of 
          Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP], has been modified by adding the entry
          point (RELPR^IBAMTV3), performing the auto-release of charges
          pending review to AR.
  
 IBAMTV3 - This routine has been modified by adding the sub-routine RELPR,
           which will loop through entries in the (#350) file, and select
           those with a status of 'HOLD-REVIEW' status for at least 60 days
           for release to AR (via routine IBOHRL).
  
 IBOHRAR - The option On Hold Charges Released to AR [IB OUTPUT RELEASED 
           CHARGES RPT] runs via this routine. It currently prints charges
           that are in 'ON HOLD' status. This report has been modified to
           allow the user to choose whether to print charges that were in
           'ON HOLD' status, 'HOLD-REVIEW' status, or both. Also, the option
           title will be changed to 'On Hold/Hold-Review Charges Released to
           AR' and the option description changed accordingly.
  
 IBOHRL - This routine has been modified to pass billing data for each of
          the above charges to the IVM package (via IVM^IBAMTV32), and to
          send a bulletin once all the charges are completed.
  
 Also, the new field HOLD-REVIEW DATE (#17) will be added to the (#350)
 file so when a charge is put in 'HOLD-REVIEW' status in the file, this
 field will be automatically "stuffed" with the current date. This will be
 similar to the file field ON HOLD DATE (#16), where if a charge is put in
 'ON HOLD' status, it's stuffed with the current date. Field (#17) will be
 used in conjunction with the modified On Hold/Hold-Review Charges Released
 to AR [IB OUTPUT RELEASED CHARGES RPT] option.
  
 A post-init routine (IB20P215), is included in this patch, and will go
 through all charges in 'HOLD-REVIEW' status in file (#350), and copy the
 date from file field DATE LAST UPDATED (#14) into new field (#17). This
 routine will be deleted after it finishes its run.
