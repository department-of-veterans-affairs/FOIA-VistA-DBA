Associated patches: (v)PSN*4*87    <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSN*4*89'

Subject: FIX CROSS REFERENCES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 
  
 1. Under certain circumstances the APD cross-reference in the DRUG
 INGREDIENT file (#50.416) was not being properly set.  This patch remedies
 that defect and creates those entries which were not properly set in the
 past.
  
 2. It has been noted that some sites have made local entries to the DRUG
 INGREDIENT file.  This should not have been done.  While this was not the
 proximal cause of the problem noted in item 1, it may have exacerbated the
 problem.  Some of these locally added ingredients may have been
 overwritten by nationally entered ingredients.
 This patch modifies the data dictionary of this file so that local
 entries can no longer be made.
  
 3. It has also been noted that over 1250 entries in the DRUG INTERACTION
 file (#56) involving these locally added ingredients have been added.
 If the locally added ingredients have been overwritten, these interactions
 will be interactions involving the national ingredients.
  
 Sites are strongly urged to review locally added interactions to verify
 that they have not been changed.
