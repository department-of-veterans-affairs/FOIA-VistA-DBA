 Problem:
 A methadone prescription which matches the methadone drug in the
 OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), METHADONE DRUG field (#.52) is ordered,
 label printed and released. When the Nightly Management Data Compile Job 
 [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE] option is run the next day, and the methadone 
 drug was the only drug released the previous day, an undefined error 
 is generated.
  
 Solution:
 This patch will correct this issue. 
  
 II. REMEDY HD106720
  
 Problem:
 When Count of Prescriptions [PSO MGMT MONTHLY RX COUNTS] options is run,
 the following fields are not populating, Medication Requests,
 Prescriptions Per Request, Equivalents Per Request.
  
 Solution:
 With the fix provided in PSOMGCOM, the report now calculates the correct 
 fields.
  
 **NOTE**
 If your site experienced any zeros printing in the Management report, 
 please run the Date Range Recompile Data option from the Management 
 Reports Menu.  You will need to recompile for any months that you have 
 had the problems encountered with zeros.
