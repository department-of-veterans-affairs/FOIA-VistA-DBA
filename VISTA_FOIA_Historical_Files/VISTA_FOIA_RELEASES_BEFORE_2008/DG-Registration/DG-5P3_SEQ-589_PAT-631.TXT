Description:
============

 This patch is being distributed with the HINQ Replacement - Interim 
 Solution patches.  The distribution is hostfile DVB_4_P49.KID.
 Please refer to the patch documentation for DVB*4.0*49 for details and
 installation instructions.  There are Release Notes and an Installation 
 Guide for this project on the Anonymous directory as well as the hostfile
 itself.  
  
 The HINQ Replacement - Interim Solution project (DVB*4*49) is increasing 
 the maximum number of Service Connected Disabilities returned from the 
 VBA in a HINQ from 6 to 150.  No Data Dictionary changes are required for 
 this change, but there are places within the Registration package where 
 the disability information will scroll off the screen if there are a lot 
 of disabilities on file.  Screen pauses will be added for these displays.
  
 IA #700 is an agreement subscribed to by eight packages for the display of
 Rated Disabilities, which is the .3721 field (2.04 multiple) of the 
 PATIENT file (#2).  The routine for this API is DIS^DGRPDB.  A call will 
 be made to PAUSE^DGRPDB when the value of $Y is within 3 lines of the end 
 of screen length.  The packages subscribing to IA #700 are :
 Fee Basis
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine
 Inpatient Medications
 Patient Representative
 Automated Info Collection Sys
 Order/Entry/Results Reporting
 Integrated Billing
 Surgery
  
 The HINQ Replacement - Interim Solution project adds four new fields to 
 the PATIENT file (#2).
  
  - Field .3014 - EFF. DATE COMBINED SC% EVAL. is the date when the
 Combined SC Percent evaluation was done.
  
  - In the Rated Disabilities multiple (2.04) the following fields are 
 added.
         Field 4 - EXTREMITY AFFECTED
         Field 5 - ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE
         Field 6 - CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE
    These fields will show on the HINQ displays, and can update the VistA 
    file if the user elects to accept the VBA Rated Disability information 
    while using the HINQUP functionality.
    These fields will display on Registration screen 7, but cannot be 
    entered or edited by VistA users on this screen.
  
 IA #4807 has been entered for a new API that will return all 6 fields of 
 the Rated Disabilities multiple, in descending Service Connected Percent 
 order.  The API is called by RDIS^DGRPDB.  The DFN (IEN for the PATIENT 
 file (#2) and an array name to store the results are the parameters.
