Subject: DISPLAY PATIENT RECORD FLAG INFO

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When a Pharmacist attempts to finish a patients prescription using
 the options available under the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO 
 LMOE FINISH] menu, the user is not provided the opportunity to 
 view patient record flags when appropriate.  This is true for all menu 
 choices except the Patient [PA] / Single [S] option, which works as 
 intended.
  
  
 1. BHH-0204-40527   Patient Record Flag displays inconsistantly in OP
                     Pharmacy
  
 Problem:
 --------
 With the exception of the single patient request, the options in 
 question are not initiated by a specific patient entry.  As a result the 
 patient lookup routines are not called.  The patient record flag 
 information is imbedded in these lookup routines.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the options in question by adding a direct call to the patient 
 record flag information routines imbedded in the patient lookup 
 routines.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business 
 hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the 
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: (when     
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*195)
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*195. 
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    YES//" respond NO. 
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be   
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
    completion.
