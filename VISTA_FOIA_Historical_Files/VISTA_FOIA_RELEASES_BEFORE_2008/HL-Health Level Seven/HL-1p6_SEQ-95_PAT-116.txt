Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Test sites:  Birmingham (Alpha/DSM), Oklahoma City (Alpha/DSM), Montana HCS 
 (Alpha/ISM), Sioux Falls(Alpha/ISM), Roseburg (Alpha/Cache) 
  
 NOIS Resolved:BIR-0304-31717
  
 It has been reported that some application acknowledgments from the IVM 
 package that should be sent to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) are 
 instead being sent to the Austin Automation Center (AAC). This patch fixes
 that problem by correctly resetting the return destination and preventing
 applications from misrouting acknowledgements.
   
 The post-install routine will clear the IIV EC queue (going to the AAC) of
 messages that are meant for the HEC, as those HEC messages serve to block the
 queue, i.e., messages that should go to the AAC are unable to be transmitted.
 The post-install routine is deleted automatically upon completion.
  
 After this patch is installed, please advise the Patient Insurance
 supervisor or MCCR Coordinator at your facility that the IIV problem has
 been resolved and that they should review their IIV Statistical Report.
 If the QUEUED INQUIRIES is greater than twice the DAILY MAXIMUM HL7 
 MESSAGES parameter setting, they may need to request assistance thru
 NOIS.  Otherwise, if comfortable with the existing IIV parameter settings,
 they should turn on the Batch Extracts making sure to answer YES when 
 prompted for SUPPRESS BUFFER CREATION.

  Installation Instructions:
  =========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  VMS SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
        routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options
        listed below:
  
          Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
          TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
        MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following 'Installation'
        menu options in the order shown below:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
  
        When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
        the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
        questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
        shown below.
  
          INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*116>
          Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols?  <NO>
  
  
    6.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
    7.  VMS Sites:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
        map set, if necessary.
  
    8.  Start Link Manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
        START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
