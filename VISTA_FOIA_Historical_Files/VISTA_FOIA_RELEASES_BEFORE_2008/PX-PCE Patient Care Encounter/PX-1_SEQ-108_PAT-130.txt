Description:
============

  The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several
  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
  packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat
  Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation
  From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service
  Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other
  medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of service
  connection.
  
  Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed
  and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this
  type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the
  number of product line dependencies.  Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim
  Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in the
  Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  It
  provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for the
  combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports cross-referenced
  against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing process.  Phase II
  of this initiative will involve multiple product lines and additional VistA
  only development.  The main goals of Phase II will be to fully automate the
  copayment billing processing of combat vets based on episode of care by
  providing the appropriate questions at check-out as supplied by CPRS.
  
  Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include
  Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated Mail
  Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE),
  Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF.  The National Patient
  Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload
  reporting.  The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
  installed.  It should be noted all patches with the exception of the PIMS
  host file have been previously released and the installation status of
  those patches should be validated at your site prior to installation the
  PIMS build:

  Product Features
  There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
    a.  Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical
        care
        o  The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those
           veterans who qualify as such per the directive
        o  The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
           audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
           schedulers, etc.)
        o  Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
           was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
           manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC
           conditions, etc.
    b.  Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
        Combat Related
        o  Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to
           identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
           related condition
    c.  Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care,
        prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
        treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless
        changed by pharmacist.
  
  
  This patch distributes the changes to PCE in support of the Combat Veteran
  initiative.
  
  
  Functional Changes
  ------------------
  1. A new prompt, 'Was treatment related to Combat?' has been added to
     the current classification prompts within the PCE Encounter Data Entry
     options and the ADD STANDALONE ENC and the UPDATE ENCOUNTER actions on
     the Encounter List screen.
  
       --- Classification --- [Required]
       Was treatment for SC Condition?
       Was treatment related to Combat?
       Was treatment related to Agent Orange Exposure?
       Was treatment related to Ionizing Radiation Exposure?
       Was treatment related to Environmental Contaminant Exposure?
       Was treatment related to Military Sexual Trauma?
       Was treatment related to Head and/or Neck Cancer?
  
  2. The List By Encounter [PXCE ENCOUNTER LIST] action on the PCE 
     Encounter Viewer [PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER] option has been
     modified to display the Combat Veteran values.
   
  3. The protocol PXCE ADD/EDIT DISPLAY DETAIL (Display Detail) will now
     display the Combat Veteran title and value.
  
       1 Encounter Date and Time:  NOV 02, 2003@09:00
         Patient Name:  BIRD,ROBIN
         Hospital Location:  GENERAL MEDICINE AT ALBANY
         Clinic Stop:  301  GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
         Service Connected:  NO
         Combat Veteran:  YES
         Agent Orange Exposure:  NO
         Ionizing Radiation Exposure:  NO
         Environmental Contaminant Exposure:  NO
         Military Sexual Trauma:  NO
         Head and/or Neck Cancer:  NO
  
  4. When editting an existing visit/encounter, PCE will delete previously
     answered classification questions if it is no longer applicable (ex:
     changing Service Connected from NO to YES will automatically delete
     the values for Agent Orange, Ionizing Radiation, and Environmental
     Contaminants).  When doing the deletion, PCE would delete the value
     from the OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION file (#409.42) but not the VISIT
     file (#9000010).  This has been corrected to delete the value from
     both files.
  
  5. When fixing PCE to correctly delete classification questions that were
     no longer applicable (see #4), the API $$DATA2PCE^PXAPI began to delete
     previously stored values for classification questions when the nodes
     for this information were not included in the input array.  Since the
     documentation for this API was vague on how not setting these nodes
     would be handled, it was decided to maintain backwards compatibility
     and adjust the API so that it only deletes classification questions if
     explicitely told to [by setting the array node equal to '@'].
  
  6. Added 'Head/Neck Cancer' and 'Combat Veteran' to DIALOG number
     8390001.003 (Warning message for service connectedness).
