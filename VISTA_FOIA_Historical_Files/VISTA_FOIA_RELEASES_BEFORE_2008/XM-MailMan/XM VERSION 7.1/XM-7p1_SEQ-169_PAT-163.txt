Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*163
  
 E3R 2658, 8649, 15053
 Test Sites:  Puget Sound HCS, Charleston, SC
 When users join a mail group, or when users are added to mail groups,
 optionally Find and Forward past mail group messages to the users.
  
 The following options now include this capability:
 XMEDITMG                       - Mail Group Edit
 XMENROLL                       - Enroll in (or Disenroll from) a Mail Group
 XMMGR-MAIL-GRP-COORDINATOR     - Mail Group Coordinator's Edit
 XMMGR-MAIL-GRP-COORD-W/REMOTES - Mail Group Coordinator's Edit W/Remotes
 XMEDITPERSGROUP                - Personal Mail Group Edit
  
 The option XMEDITMG is being converted from an 'edit' type option to a 'run
 routine' type option.  The pre-init, ^XMYPRE11, will delete the fields in the
 option which are no longer applicable.
  
 The pre-init will also check entries in file 3.8, MAIL GROUP.  If the group is
 public, any entry in the 'Restrictions' field (#10) will be deleted.  (This
 field only applies to private groups.)  If the group is private, any entry in
 the 'Allow self-enrollment?' (#7) field will be deleted.  This field only
 applies to public groups. 
  
 If someone other than the organizer or coordinator adds users to a public
 mail group which doesn't allow self-enrollment, or to a private mail group,
 a new bulletin, XM GROUP EDIT NOTIFY, is sent to the organizer and
 coordinator to let them know which users were added and who added them.
  
 A new security key, XM GROUP EDIT MASTER, is being created, which should be
 assigned to any users, such as ADPACs, who need to be able to edit other
 users' mail groups.
 NAME: XM GROUP EDIT MASTER
   DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Edit other users' mail groups
  DESCRIPTION:   People who need to be able to edit other users' mail groups
  and add new users to them should be assigned this key.  
   
  Holders of this key may edit any mail group, except personal mail groups. 
  (Personal mail groups are those which only the organizer may edit or use.) 
   
  The following users should NOT be given this key, because they already
  possess the privilege this key grants: 
   - Holders of the XMMGR key.  
   - Clinical Application Coordinators, as identified in file 8930,
  USR Class, belonging to the TIU package.  
  
 Applicable Help frames are updated.
  
 New APIs have been added.  See DBIA 3006.
 ADDMBRS^XMXAPIG  - Add members to mail groups.  Optionally forward past
                    mail group messages.
 JOIN^XMXAPIG     - Enable user to enroll in mail group.  Optionally forward
                    past mail group messages.
 DROP^XMXAPIG     - Enable user to drop from a mail group.
  $$MEMBER^XMXAPIG - Is user a member of a mail group?
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*141 & XM*7.1*148.
