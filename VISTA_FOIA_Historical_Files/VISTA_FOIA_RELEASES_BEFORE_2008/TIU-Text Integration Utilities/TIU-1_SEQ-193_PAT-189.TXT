Subject: LIST DOCUMENTS LACKING EXPECTED COSIGNER AND FIX MENU SYNONYMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues:
  
 1.This patch contains a report to list TIU documents that have a status
 of "UNCOSIGNED" and yet the "EXPECTED COSIGNER" field is null, 0 or -1.
 The report has three available print formats:
         1) Standard 80 column print. This includes the fields Patient 
            in the format of 3 initials and last 4 of SSN, Entry Date/Time,
            Document Title, Author and Document IEN.
         2) Extended 132 column print. This includes the above fields plus
            the Author's Service/Section and Job Title.
         3) "^" delimited display with the same fields as the 123 column
            report. This is for use in exporting the data into Excel or a 
            similar application.
 If a document is an Addendum all three formats will include the parent 
 document's Title, Entry Date/Time and Expected Cosigner.
  
 This patch DOES NOT fix the problem that permits documents to be signed 
 without an Expected Cosigner. The actual fix is in patch OR*3.0*215.
 This report is called TIU MISSING EXPECTED COSIGNER and can be found 
 under the TIU MAIN MENU MGR option. It may be set up in Taskman to
 run nightly. The nightly job will send the results to the newly 
 created Mail Group TIU MIS ALERTS if any problem notes are found.
  
 Users should review the notes displayed on this report to determine who 
 should be the expected cosigner and then enter the expected cosigner. 
 Once a note is signed the software doesn't permit editing so they will 
 need to use FileMan. The author of the note may need to be contacted to 
 determine who should be the expected cosigner. To edit the EXPECTED 
 COSIGNER field do the following:
         1) Go into the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES option in FileMan.
         2) At the INPUT TO WHAT FILE prompt type TIU DOCUMENT or 8925.
         3) At the EDIT WHICH FIELD prompt type 1208.
         4) At the THEN EDIT FIELD prompt just hit Enter.
         5) At the Select TIU DOCUMENT DOCUMENT TYPE: prompt type in
            a ` followed by the Note IEN from the report/mail message. 
           (The ' mark  is found on the same key as the tilde (~) - 
           usually above the TAB key.)
         6) At the EXPECTED COSIGNER prompt enter the person you want to 
            cosign the document.
  
  
 2.This patch also addresses the incorrect mnemonic for the option 
 "UNKNOWN ADDENDA CLEANUP". There are 2 menu items with a mnemonic of "9". 
 This patch will resend the TIU MAIN MENU MGR menu option and all of its 
 children/grandchildren options. This will correct the problem of item 10 
 and also add item 11 - the new report listed above.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
                                        
 Problem 1:
 ----------
  
 HD69324 - CLL-1100-40509  Expected Cosigner
  
 There were cases (see OR*3.0*215) where a TIU note would end up in a 
 status of "UNCOSIGNED" yet the "EXPECTED COSIGNER" field was null, 0 or 
 -1. That issue is fixed with OR*3.0*215. However, there needs to be a way 
 to identify notes that have this problem.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch provides a report to identify notes with this problem that 
 can be run from two entry points.
  
   1) It can be run from menu option "Missing Expected Cosigner 
      Report" found under the TIU Menu "TIU MAIN MENU MGR." This version 
      will prompt for a date range and can be run at any time.
   2) It can be tasked as a nightly job. This will only look for problems 
      in notes from the previous 31 days. This version will send an email
      with the details to the new mail group "TIU MIS ALERTS" if any 
      problem notes are found.
  
         The entry point for tasking this routine is "NITE^TIU189" and the 
         option name is "TIU MISSING COSIGNER NITE JOB". 
  
 PROBLEM 2:
 -----------
 HD96285 - TIU MAIN MENU MGR option has two #9 selections
  
 There are 2 menu items with a mnemonic of "9".
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 This patch will resend the TIU MAIN MENU MGR menu option with the 
 corrected children. This will fix the 2 options with the same mnemonic and
 add the new report from problem 1 to the menu.
