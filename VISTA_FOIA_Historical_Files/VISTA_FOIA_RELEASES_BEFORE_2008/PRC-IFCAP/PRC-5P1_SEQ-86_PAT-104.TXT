Subject: MODIFY PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT EXTRACT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will change how data is extracted from File 442 (Procurement & 
 Accounting Transactions) to create the PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT extract.  
 Originally, the option extracted data from the first of the month and at
 least 45 days prior to the date of the extract.  This change will now 
 extract data from the beginning of the Fiscal Year until the date the
 extract is run.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1.  HD152022 - IFCAP bug identified in PRCHLO - Causing issues with CLRS 
                data rollup
 2.  HD140902 - Site Unable to Submit GIP Report
     Duplicate: HD153080 - File 442 Entries Not X-ref'd appropriately

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Ref:  HD152022
 The original logic to extract data from file 442 pulls one month's worth 
 of data.  The original logic also makes sure each record that is pulled 
 is at least 45 days old based on running the extract on the 15th of the 
 month.  It was discovered after analyzing 4 months worth of data that 
 there is a discrepancy between the IFCAP PO Activity data and the 
 Prosthetics NPPD Data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To correct this problem and sync the IFCAP CLRS data with Prosthetics
 NPPD data, the date range of the IFCAP extract will be changed to start 
 with the beginning of the Fiscal Year  and end with the date the extract
 is run.
  
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 Ref:  HD140902, HD153080
 An issue has been identified that may affect CLRS and possibly other 
 IFCAP modules.  The issue involves pointers from File 442 to File 441 
 where the entry no longer exists or is corrupt.  Please note that per the 
 Prosthetics and Clinical Logistics Office (P&CLO) as well as HSD&D 
 guidance, entries should never be deleted from File 441.  When no longer 
 used, entries should be inactivated as there are still files that contain 
 pointers to them.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Please follow the Pre-Installation instructions below to address this 
 issue.
  
 ====================Pre-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
 The following FileMan Utility (Verify Fields) will identify any possible 
 problems where the ITEM MASTER FILE NO. field contains a pointer to an 
 entry which has been deleted from File 441 (ITEM MASTER).  It will also 
 identify potential problems with cross-references not being defined 
 appropriately in File 442 for this field.
  
 The FileMan utility will need to be run prior to applying the patch.  If 
 the report indicates "NO PROBLEMS", please proceed with the installation 
 of this patch.  If the report displays data with error messages (as 
 described in the screen capture below) these will need to be 
 addressed/corrected.  If you require assistance in resolving these 
 "errors", please log a Remedy Ticket or contact the VA Service Desk 
 (888-596-4357) and a Remedy Ticket will be logged for you.  
  
 WARNING:  DO NOT REINDEX File 442 or File 441!  This will create major 
 problems that cannot be corrected.  Log a Remedy Ticket for assistance as 
 the errors will need to be addressed individually.
  
 Please proceed to the Installation Instructions if no errors are
 encountered or when the errors have been resolved.
