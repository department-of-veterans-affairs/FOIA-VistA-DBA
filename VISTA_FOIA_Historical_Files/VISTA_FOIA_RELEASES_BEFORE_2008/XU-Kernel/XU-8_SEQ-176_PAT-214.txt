Subject: RESTRICT USER TO PATIENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OE/RR LIST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Print Template
  - Input Template

Description: 
============

 This patch was created to support the BVA (Board of Veterans Appeals) 
 project to allow CPRS to restrict the access of users in the NEW 
 PERSON file (#200) to those patients associated with a specific OE/RR 
 LIST.
  
 Changes to NEW PERSON file (#200)
 ---------------------------------
 This patch adds two new fields to the NEW PERSON file:
  
 200,101.01    RESTRICT PATIENT SELECTION  101;1  SET
                                 '0' FOR NO;
                                 '1' FOR YES;
               DESCRIPTION:      Answer 'YES' to restrict this user to 
                                 selecting only those patients associated
                                 with the list pointed to by the PATIENT
                                 SELECTION LIST field (#101.02).
  
 200,101.02    PATIENT SELECTION LIST  101;2  POINTER TO FILE #100.21
               DESCRIPTION:      If a value is entered into this field, the
                                 user is allowed to select only those
                                 patients associated with this OE/RR LIST.
  
         Option: ADD A NEW USER [XUSERNEW]
           Form: XUEXISTING USER
 Input Template: XUNEW USER
 -----------------------------------------
 The change to this option adds the two new fields to the form and the 
 input template used when a new entry is added to the NEW PERSON file. 
 Also, the TERMINATION DATE and DISUSER fields are moved to the first page
 of the form to make them easier to see.
  
  
         Option: EDIT AN EXISTING USER [XUSEREDIT]
           Form: XUEXISTING USER
 Input Template: XUEXISTING USER
 -------------------------------------------------
 The change to this option adds the two new fields to the form and the 
 input template used when a NEW PERSON file entry is edited. Also, the
 TERMINATION DATE and DISUSER fields are moved to the first page of the
 form to make them easier to see.
  
  
         Option: USER INQUIRY [XUSERINQ]
 Print Template: XUSERINQ
 ---------------------------------------
 The change to this option causes the two new fields to be displayed in 
 the report.
                                 
  
  Option: GRANT ACCESS BY PROFILE [XUSERBLK]
 Routine: XUSERBLK
 -------------------------------------------
 The change to this option, which calls routine XUSERBLK, causes the 
 contents of the RESTRICT PATIENT SELECTION field (#101.01) and PATIENT 
 SELECTION LIST (#101.02) to be included in the copying process.
