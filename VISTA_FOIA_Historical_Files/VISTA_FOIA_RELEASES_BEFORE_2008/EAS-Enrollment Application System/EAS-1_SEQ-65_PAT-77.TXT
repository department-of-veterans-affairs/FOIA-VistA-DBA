  *************************************************************************
  
 In the Fall of 2004, the Scheduling Replacement Team released the 
 Scheduling API to retrieve appointment data. In December, 2004, the
 Enrollment Maintenance Team released software implementing the API into
 the Registration, Beneficiary Travel, Enrollment Application System, and
 Income Verification Match software packages. Recent modifications to the
 Scheduling API have necessitated further modifications to the software.
  
 The Scheduling Encapsulation Update project will require modifications
 in the VistA environment only, with the scope of these modifications
 encompassing the following activities:
  
 - Deleting data that may not have been cleared from temporary global
    workspace
 - Minor changes to Appointment Status filter to return wanted values only
 - Minor changes to Appointment Type parameter passing to return wanted 
    values only
 - Database error not displaying when Replacement Scheduling Application
   (RSA) database is down
 - Implement RSA database performance suggestions in several routines
 - Enhance error message handling to include all three Error Messages 101, 
    115 and 117 (see change #5 in patch description for DG*5.3*725).
                                                                
  
 This patch includes the following changes to the stated routines:
  
 Correct Database Error Display/Handling Issues When RSA Database Is Down:
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When the Appointment API returned an error message, routines EASMTRP1 and
  EASMTRP3 ignored the error message and continued their processing as if
  there were no appointments for the veterans. These routines have been
  modified to check for error handling and stop processing if an error has
  been encountered.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
