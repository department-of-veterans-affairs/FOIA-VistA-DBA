Subject: EXCLUDE FROM FACILITY DIRECTORY HL7

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 12 has a COTS centralized
 patient call center. The call center uses a centralized database to route
 incoming patient calls. The database is updated from 7 hospitals within
 the VISN via HL7 messages. VISN 12 requested an enhancement to the VistA
 Registration software package to support the facility directory Opt Out
 option which is a HIPAA requirement. The existing ADT HL7 message,
 generated by the VistA Registration software package, has been enhanced to
 include the "Opt Out" or "Opt In" information in the PV2 segment of the
 HL7 messages. This change will synchronize the call center database with
 the VistA databases.
