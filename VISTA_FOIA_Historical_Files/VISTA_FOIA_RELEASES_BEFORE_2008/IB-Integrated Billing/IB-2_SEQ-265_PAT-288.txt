Description:
============

 This patch includes enhancements and corrects problems with the recent 
 Medicare Remittance Advice (MRA) patch.  Miscellaneous problems with the 
 recent EDI enhancements patch are also included here.
  
 1.  The existing "AE" x-ref in the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) is being 
 reconstructed so that now the Medicare (WNR) insurance company entry is 
 also included.  This x-ref prevents policy deletion if the policy is used 
 on an active claim.
  
 2.  Denied MRAs for duplicate claim/service are now optionally excluded 
 from appearing on the MRA management worklist.  If they do appear on the 
 worklist, then the user will see "** Denied for Duplicate **" highlighted 
 on the worklist main screen.
  
 3.  The MRA statistics report has been corrected to show accurate numbers 
 for the automatically authorized secondary claims.
  
 4.  Corrected the EDI 837 data elements dealing with the person/non-person
 indicator.  When using a non-VA provider, this indicator was incorrectly
 assuming that the entry was a non-person.  This has been corrected for 4 
 different provider types - attending/rendering, referring, operating, and
 other.
  
 5.  EDI transmitted names now have periods stripped before transmitting.
  
 6.  The state name for the license number extract for non-VA providers 
 was corrected.
  
 7.  The hospital and professional provider number (670899) for the 
 Medicare (WNR) insurance company entry was moved over into the FACILITY 
 BILLING ID file (#355.92).
  
 8.  When the principle diagnosis code is missing on screen 5 of the 
 billing screens, the user will be told as to whether or not the code is 
 required.  The user will see either UNSPECIFIED or UNSPECIFIED [NOT 
 REQUIRED].  This is the standard notice for the billing screens.
  
 9.  The 837 Test transmit queue is being re-set to "MCT".
  
 10.  A new national IB edit check is being added.  The insurance company 
 subscriber's date of birth must be entered for all insurances listed on 
 the claim.
  
 11.  When cloning an MRA bill and then manually changing the payer 
 sequence of the subsequent new claim, the system was assuming that an MRA 
 was still needed for this new claim and bill printing did not work 
 correctly.  This has been fixed.
  
 12.  A hard error was fixed when accessing the non-VA provider add/edit
 functionality using the option NON-VA Facility Data [IBCE PRVNVA FAC 
 EDIT].  The error occurs because the code is used by both list manager and
 option functions and the list manager variables are not set in the option
 call.  The fix is to make the calls to the  list manager specific code
 conditional on it being called via a list manager action.
  
 13.  Due to EDI status message timing issues, an EDI rejection status 
 message may arrive after the claim has already been cancelled.  This 
 patch prevents any cancelled claims from appearing on the CSA screen.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch may take a long time to install because a cross reference 
 file is being rebuilt for the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399).  This file is 
 typically very large and it will take some time for FileMan to rebuild 
 this cross reference.
  
 Therefore, it is recommended that this installation take place after 
 normal working hours.  If it must be installed during the normal workday,
 it is recommended that the following selections in the OPTION (#19) file,
 and all of their descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts
 while running the KIDS Install.  Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
   Patient Insurance Info View/Edit   [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE] 
   MRA Management WorkList            [IBCE MRA MANAGEMENT]
   MRA Statistics Report              [IBCEM MRA STATISTICS REPORT]

   NON-VA Facility Data               [IBCE PRVNVA FAC EDIT]
  
 Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job is
 running or when EDI claims are being transmitted.  Check field HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (8.06) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (350.9).
  
 Installation Time:  Possibly up to 2 hours
  
 Our test sites reported the following installation times.
