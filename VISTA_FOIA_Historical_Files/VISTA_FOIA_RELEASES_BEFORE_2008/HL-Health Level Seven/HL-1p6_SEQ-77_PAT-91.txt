Subject: New NAMESPACE field in HL7 Message Text file

Description: 
============

 Test sites:    Greater Los Angeles Regional Healthcare (West Los Angeles),
                Grand Junction, Sheridan
  
 NOIS:          None
  
 Note:          This patch requires that KIDS builds HL*1.6*47, HL*1.6*57,
                HL*1.6*59, and HL*1.6*82 be installed.
  
 OVERVIEW
  
 The Health Level 7 (HL7) messages sent and received by sites are being
 increasingly studied for workflow patterns and totals.  This evaluation of
 HL7 data by clients of the HL7 package has resulted in the request for HL7
 totals subdivided by the namespace of the message's originating package.
 Unfortunately, the namespace of a message is not always determinable.
  
 This patch provides a method for HL7 clients to pass their namespace into 
 the HL7 APIs that create messages or acknowledgements. When this is done,
 the provided namespace will be stored with the message, enabling
 subsequent totaling by namespace.  Additional details of this patch are
 provided next.
  
 DETAILS
  
 There are three supported HL7 APIs by which HL7 messages are created: 
  
  - GENERATE^HLMA(HLEID,HLARYTYP,HLFORMAT,.HLRESLT,HLMTIEN,.HLP)
  - GENACK^HLMA1(HLEID,HLMTIENS,HLEIDS,HLARYTYP,HLFORMAT,
                .HLRESLTA,HLMTIENA,.HLP)
  - DIRECT^HLMA(HLEID,HLARYTYP,HLFORMAT,.HLRESLT,HLMTIEN,.HLP)
  
 In all three APIs, the last parameter HLP is passed by reference.  Prior 
 to calling these APIs, the client package may set HLP array elements and 
 then pass these by reference into the API.  An example call using the HLP 
 array is shown below.
  
   <tab>S HLP("SECURITY")=1214315
   <tab>D GENERATE^HLMA(HLEID,HLARYTYP,HLFORMAT,.HLRESLT,HLMTIEN,.HLP)
  
 These APIs, including the HLP pass-by-reference array, are documented in 
 section 12.1.2, 12.1.3, and 12.1.4 of the VistA HL7 Site Manager & 
 Developer Manual.
  
 After patch HL*1.6*91 is installed, an additional HLP array element may
 be defined before calling these APIs by which the namespace of the client 
 process can be made known to the API code.  This additional HLP array 
 element is HLP("NAMESPACE").  An example call using this new array 
 element is shown below.
  
   <tab>S HLP("NAMESPACE")="DG"
   <tab>S HLP("SECURITY")=1214315
   <tab>D GENERATE^HLMA(HLEID,HLARYTYP,HLFORMAT,.HLRESLT,HLMTIEN,.HLP)
  
 (The array contained in these three APIs is HLP, and this patch 
 documentation consistently refers to HLP.  However, since this is a 
 pass-by-reference array, any array name may be selected by the client 
 process calling these APIs.)
  
 Patch HL*1.6*91 creates a new field in the HL7 Message Text file (#772) 
 to store the client process namespace when it is passed as described 
 above.  This new field's definition is shown below.
  
 'NAMESPACE' FIELD STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY LISTING
 --------------------------------------------------
 772,16        NAMESPACE              0;13 FREE TEXT
  
        INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>4!($L(X)<1)!'(X?1U1.3NU) X
        LAST EDITED:      FEB 15, 2002
        HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-4 characters in length,
                          and start with 1 uppercase letter,
                          followed by up to 3 uppercase letters and
                          numerics.
        DESCRIPTION:      This field must not be filled in
                          manually.  It will be filled in
                          automatically by the HL7 processes that
                          create entries in the HL7 Message Text
                          file (#772).  In most instances,
                          applications will call GENERATE^HLMA,
                          GENACK^HLMA, or DIRECT^HLMA.  When they
                          do, they will pass by reference into the
                          last OPTIONS (in the documentation)
                          parameter the value of the namespace.
                          The value of the namespace will be in the
                          form of OPTIONS("NAMESPACE")=NAMESPACE.
  
                          Please note that the calls to the three
                          APIs mentioned above use the variable HLP
                          to hold the passed in by reference array.
                          So, in the HLMA code (and other code
                          invoked by HLMA), the actual variable
                          used is HLP("NAMESPACE").
  
                          This field is populated by UPDATE^HLTF0.
  
 When the client process defines HLP("NAMESPACE") prior to the API call, 
 and passes in the HLP array (as shown in the above example), the defined 
 namespace is stored in the HL7 Message Text file (#772) entry created.  
 The code that actually stores HLP("NAMESPACE") in this file is contained 
 in UPDATE^HLTF0.
  
 All HLP array elements are optional; they are not required when these 
 APIs are called.  However, it is strongly recommended that the 
 HLP("NAMESPACE") array element be defined whenever it is possible to 
 determine the proper namespace.
  
  
 Note: HL7 messaging by the Master Patient Index (MPI) application occurs
       using the EN^HLCSAC API.  The private use of this API by the MPI
       application is covered by Integration Agreement 3471.  It is
       important that MPI HL7 messages be assigned the correct namespace,
       and this is done automatically now.  There is no need for the
       MPI application to pass their namespace into the EN^HLCSAC API.
       In the future, if this API is opened up to other applications,
       there is a way to override the MPI namespace saved.  If the
       local variable HLP("NAMESPACE") is defined before calling the
       EN^HLCSAC API, the value of HLP("NAMESPACE") will be saved in
       the message as the namespace.

 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums after patch
 installation.
  
 There are five routines above whose checksums will not change after this 
 patch is installed; HLMA, HLMA1, HLMA2, HLTP1, and HLTP4.  The only 
 changes made to these routines is the addition of comment lines 
 documenting the new HLP("NAMESPACE") array element.  Since comment lines 
 are not counted in a routine's checksum, the addition of these comment 
 lines do not affect the routine's checksums.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
    NOTICE:  Do not proceed unless patches HL*1.6*47, HL*1.6*57, 
             HL*1.6*59, and HL*1.6*82 have been installed.
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  AXP/DSM SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If the
        routine listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section is mapped, it
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Stop all background processes (logical links and incoming
        and outgoing filers) using the 'Filer and Link Management 
        Option's 'Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]' 
        menu option.
  
    4.  Stop the link manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop 
        [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
  
    5.  AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this
        installation.
  
    6.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    7.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. This is done using the 'Installation' menu's 'Install
        Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD]' menu option. When using this
        menu option to install the patch build, you will be asked
        several questions.  The questions, and the answers you should
        supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*91>
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
  
    8.  Start all background processes (logical links and incoming
        and outgoing filers) using the Filer and Link Management 
        Option's 'Restart/Start All Links and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]'
        menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
    9. AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: If you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
       for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
   10.  AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: After the patch has been installed, rebuild
        your map set, if necessary.
  
   11.  Start the link manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
        [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
