Subject: PFSS SURVEY/CT RX DEFAULT DX/CLASSIFICATION ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two Remedy tickets 1) Regarding bills being created 
 without the site's specified default prescription diagnosis and 
 2) Looking up an encounter's classification answers error within 
 PXKENC routine.  It also conducts a survey of continuously hospitalized
 patients for the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) project.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 HD114316 Problem creating Pharmacy Claims in IB
  
  
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------
 Remedy Ticket #: HD114316
        Problem:  With the release of Clinical Indicator Data Capture
                  (CIDC) software, patch IB*2*260, if a site had a DEFAULT
                  RX REFILL DX (#1.29) field in the IB SITE PARAMETERS
                  (#350.9) file defined and a prescription was issued using
                  the related CIDC patch for the Outpatient Pharmacy
                  package (PSO*7*143) while the CIDC switches were all off,
                  the Integrated Billing (IB) software would ignore the
                  default diagnosis code when creating new bills in the
                  BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file.
     Resolution:  IB will now automatically store the default diagnosis 
                  code on a bill as it used to if there is not one
                  specifically identified with the prescription.
  
  
 Additional Remedy Ticket Not Addressed:
 ---------------------------------------
 Remedy Ticket #: HD114933
        Problem:  With the release of CIDC (IB*2*260) IB attempts to use a 
                  more accurate Service Connected/Environmental Indicators
                  (SC/EI) determinations.  If an Outpatient Encounter is in
                  a Checked Out status that does not have an associated PCE
                  Visit, it can cause a null subscript error to occur.  
                  This Remedy Ticket is not resolved by this patch.  During
                  testing of PX*1*174 a test site reported on the Patch
                  Tracking Message for that patch additional
                  <SUBSCRIPT>ENCEVENT+10^PXKENC errors.  After further
                  investigation it was found the subsequent errors were
                  caused by the IB package.  Patch PX*1*174 will resolve
                  the Remedy Ticket.
     Resolution:  IB will revert to the original (prior to IB*2*260) SC/EI
                  determinations if a PCE Visit is not available to
                  evaluate.
  
  
  
 Overview of Patch Items:
 ------------------------
  
 1) Survey of Continuously Hospitalized Patients
    --------------------------------------------
    In preparation of the PFSS project a survey of all sites needs to be 
    conducted to determine if sites still have continuously hospitalized 
    patients since 1986.  The IB package has a file, IB CONTINUOUS PATIENT 
    (#351.1), that stores a list of patients that have been continuously 
    hospitalized since 1986.  A post init routine will look through that
    file and determine if there are any patients that are still active
    inpatients.  A MailMan message is generated by the post install with
    the results and sent to G.PFSS CONT HOSP PATIENTS@FORUM.VA.GOV to
    report the results.
