Subject: FORM LETTERS: PRINT FORMAT, VENDORS TO RECEIVE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues. The first issue is about the letters for
 the CWT PROCEEDS and PARKING FEES bills which are not being generated so
 vendors can not receive the notices about their bills. The second issue is
 about the letter format - where the address is printing too low to appear
 in the envelope window.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD64508 STC-1204-40768  CWT PROCEEDS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site started using the category CWT PROCEEDS and PARKING FEES on the 
    bill. These bills passed their statement dates and didn't print the
    letters for vendors.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PRCAGF to use the vendor form letters for the bill
    when it associates with the category CWT PROCEEDS or PARKING FEES.
  
 2. HD64217 MUS-0904-71205 Problem with AR letter format.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that the form feeds on the letter were causing the
    address not align with the envelope window and they were able to change
    routine PRCAGF to correct the problem. Since all sites are using the
    standard envelope, the software fix should be tested and released by a
    national patch.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PRCAGF to contain the fix to correct the problem with
    the form feeds of the letter header.
