Subject: DIALOG CHANGE FOR LAB QUICK ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch resolves a problem in Lab Quick orders when a
  Collection Sample/Specimen is changed in the Laboratory Test
  file (#60).
  
  When the lab collection sample is changed in the Laboratory Test 
  file (#60), it was not possible, when editing a Lab Quick Order,
  to change the old collection sample to the new collection sample.
  The user is not prompted in most cases for a Collection Sample.
  
  
 TEST PLAN:
 ==========
  To duplicate this problem, change the Collection Sample and
  Specimen values in the Lab Package for a test that has been
  previously defined in CPRS as a quick order.
  Then from OE/RR VISTA do the following...
  
  Select Order Menu Management Option:  Enter/edit quick orders
  Select QUICK ORDER NAME:    LRT HDL SERUM MARBLED
  NAME: LRT HDL SERUM MARBLED   Replace
  DISPLAY TEXT: HDL//
  VERIFY ORDER: NO//
  DESCRIPTION:
    1>
  ENTRY ACTION:
  Lab Test: HDL//
  SEND TO LAB - Means the patient is ambulatory and will be sent
  to the Laboratory draw room to have blood drawn.
  WARD COLLECT - Means that either the physician or a nurse will
  be collecting the sample on the ward.
  LAB BLOOD TEAM - Means the phlebotomist from Lab will draw the
  blood on the ward.  This method is limited to laboratory defined
  collection times.
  IMMEDIATE COLLECT BY BLOOD TEAM - Means the phlebotomist from Lab
  is on call to draw blood on the ward.  This method is available
  during times defined by Laboratory.

  Select QUICK ORDER NAME:
  ___________________________________________________________
  
  After applying this patch, follow the same sequence, and you will
  be given the opportunity to edit the Collection Sample.  
   
  NOTE: For the value of the Collection Sample to be changed, make
  sure you enter the new Collection Sample value in.  This may appear
  confusing if the new value has the same name as the old value, such
  as BLOOD (PLASMA) -vs- BLOOD (SERUM).  In addition, if the Lab Quick
  Order was created prior to OERR v3.0, the name of the Quick Order
  may contain a reference to the  obsolete collection sample.  At the 
  NAME prompt, edit the Quick Order name to reflect the change in
  collection sample.
   
   Example:
  Select Order Menu Management Option:  Enter/edit quick orders
  Select QUICK ORDER NAME:    LRT HDL SERUM MARBLED
  NAME: LRT HDL SERUM MARBLED   Replace SERUM MARBLED   With PLASMA
    ^^^^ Edit Name to reflect new Collection Sample^^^^
