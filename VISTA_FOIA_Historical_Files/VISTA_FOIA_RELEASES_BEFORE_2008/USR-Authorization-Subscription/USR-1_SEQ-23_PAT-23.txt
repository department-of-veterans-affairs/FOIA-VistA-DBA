 I. DESCRIPTION:
    ============
  
 Patches USR*1*23 and TIU*1*137 both support patch LR*5.2*259, Anatomic
 Pathology Electronic Signature. Patches USR*1*23 and TIU*1*137 are sent 
 out together in a single distribution.
  
 This patch (USR*1*23) contains routines used to create a new User Class
 and new Business Rules for Anatomic Pathology documents. These rules
 prevent actions from TIU options on Anatomic Pathology documents, ensuring
 that such documents are managed solely from the Anatomic Pathology menu.
 These rules must NOT be locally edited or deleted. Members must NOT be
 added to the new User Class. It must remain EMPTY.
