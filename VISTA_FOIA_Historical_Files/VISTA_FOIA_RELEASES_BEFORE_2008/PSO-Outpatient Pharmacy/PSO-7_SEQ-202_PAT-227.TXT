Description:
============

 The Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) project that was providing 
 functionality to furnish medications prescribed by Non-VA Physicians 
 needs to be shut down as the period for its eligibility expired on 
 October 22, 2004.  Inactivation of the TPB functionality will be done in 2
 steps, a manual step and an automatic step.
  
 Step I-To make sure that the Health Level Seven (HL7) data transmission  
       of TPB eligible patients to the Austin Automation Center (AAC) is 
       shutdown.
 Step II-The installation of this patch will automatically inactivate all
      the TPB functionality.

 ***********************************************************************
 The data transmission of a TPB eligible patient from the TPB ELIGIBILITY
 file (#52.91) is performed by the PSOTPBAAC HL7 logical link.
  
   a. To check whether this link is enabled or not, use the HL7 Main Menu 
      [HL MAIN MENU] option and select the Systems Link Monitor 
      [HL MESSAGE MONITOR] option, you should see the following screen:

   b. If the PSOTPBAAC logical link is enabled then you need to shut down
      the link by performing the following steps:
      - Use the HL7 Main Menu Option [HL MAIN MENU] option
      - Select the Filer and Link Management Options
         [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] option
      - Select the 'Start/Stop Links' option [HL START] option
      - At the 'Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE: ' prompt, type PSOTPBAAC and
        press enter. The system will prompt 'Okay to shut down this job?',
        answer 'YES' and press enter.
        The system will display the following message:
        'The job for the PSOTPBAAC Lower Level Protocol will be shut down.'
      - To ensure the link is shut down use the Systems Link Monitor [HL
        MESSAGE MONITOR] option and make sure the status is 'Shutdown'
        (step a. above).

 *** Step II - Automated Step                                          ***
 *************************************************************************
 1. This patch disables the following menu options by placing them out of
    order.
       - TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT]
       - TPB Institution Letter Enter/Edit [PSO TPB INSTITUTION LETTERS]
       - Report TPB Patients Letters Printed/NOT Printed
          [PSO TPB LETTERS PRINTED REPORT]
       - Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Patient Enter/Edit
          [PSO TPB PATIENT ENTER/EDIT]
       - TPB Patient Report [PSO TPB PATIENT REPORT]
       - Report of Patients with TPB and Non-TPB Rx's
          [PSO TPB PATIENT RX REPORT]
       - Print TPB Patient Letter(s) [PSO TPB PRINT LETTERS]
       - TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY]
  
 2. Inactivation of all active TPB patients
    This patch will scan all the entries in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file
    (#52.91) and will populate the INACTIVATION OF BENEFIT DATE field (#2)
    of the active patients with today's date and the INACTIVATION REASON
    CODE field (#3) with the code "10-PROGRAM ENDED".
  
 3. When a prescription is discontinued, routine PSOTPCAN is called to
    check if that's the last active TPB prescription for an Active TPB
    patient, and if so, the patient TPB patient is inactivated from TPB
    ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). Based on the fact that there will be no
    active TPB patient upon installing of this patch, routine PSOTPCAN is
    modified to terminate without checking for last active TPB
    prescription.
  
 4. Prior to this patch, Outpatient Pharmacy software was notified by the
    Scheduling software of each patient appointment at a VA clinic. If the
    patient is eligible for the TPB benefit, the appointment was at a
    clinic defined as primary care for the TPB program (determined through
    a set of clinic stop codes) AND the patient does not have any "active"
    TPB prescription(s) on file, this patient will have the TPB eligibility
    automatically inactivated (introduced by PSO*7*160). As all active TPB
    patient's will be inactivated (item #2 above), there is no need for
    this functionality to continue. This patch will stop this functionality
    by removing the PSO TPB SD SUB protocol entry from the SDAM APPOINTMENT
    EVENTS Scheduling protocol.
  
 5. This patch will set the AUTOSTART field (#4.5) of the HL LOGICAL LINK
    file (#870) of the PSOTPBAAC Logical Link to "Disabled", to prevent
    restarting of the PSOTPBAAC logical link by TaskMan after a system
    reboot.
  
 6. The TPB data extraction job is queued to run daily and transmit
    data to the AAC every Sunday. This patch will remove the TPB HL7 Data
    Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option from the Task
    Manager.
  
 Note:
      - The post install routine (PSO227PO) included in this patch
        addresses all items in step II except #3.
      - Most of the TPB routines that are transported in this patch are 
        modified to "QUIT" if they are ever called by any other routine.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy users
 on the system. Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5
 minutes.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
      Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*227):
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*227.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
  
   9. Use the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option and select the Systems 
      Link Monitor [HL MESSAGE MONITOR] option. If the PSOTPBAAC logical
      link is enabled, shut it down as instructed in the patch description.
