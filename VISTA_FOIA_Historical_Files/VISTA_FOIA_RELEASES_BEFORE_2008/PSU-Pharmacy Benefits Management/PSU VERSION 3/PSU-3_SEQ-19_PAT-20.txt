Subject: INCORRECT LEAP YEAR DATE/MISSING DIVISION NAMES IN PBM EXTRACT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 Problem 1:  
  
 For the Manual Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] option, the date range
 for the February extract does not distinguish leap years from non-leap
 years. The end date for the February extract on all reports other than
 the Timing and Confirmation messages is always recorded as February 29,
 regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.
  
 In addition, on the PBM Timing and Confirmation messages, February 29 is not
 recognized as a legitimate end date for the February extract in non-leap
 years. Therefore the end date defaults to the start date and the date range
 displays as February 1 to February 1.
  
  
 Resolution 1:
  
 The code for the Manual Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] option is altered
 to take leap years into account so that the correct February date range is
 displayed on all PBM messages.
  
  
 Problem 2:
  
 At some facilities the Mailman message subject header on the PBM messages
 displays only the facility/division number, and does not display the name of
 the facility/division.
  
 Resolution 2:
  
 There are two possible solutions to this problem.  (1) Some sites have
 assigned more than one division name to a division number in MEDICAL CENTER
 DIVISION file (#40.8).  In these instances, a user at the site should correct
 the file definitions so that only one division name is assigned to one
 division number.  (2) The code is altered to correct missing division names
 on the message headers when the problem is not user error.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
   take less than 1 minute. There are no scheduling restrictions or
   recommendations.
  
   1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
        routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
        mapped set.
  
   3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
   4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSU*3.0*20:
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSU*3.0*20.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
