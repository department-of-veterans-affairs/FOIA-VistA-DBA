Subject: INPATIENT APPOINTMENT REPORTS ENCAPSULATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 Inpatient Appointment Reports options: Future Appointments for Inpatients 
 [SDWARD] and Inpatient Appointment List [SDAPP INPT] have been modified 
 to replace any direct call to Appointment Data in the Patient file (#2) 
 and the Hospital Location file (#44) with a call to SDAPI API. SDAPI API
 retrieves Appointment Data whether it resides in VistA files or non-VistA
 files.
  
 The Scheduling Replacement API "SDAPI^SDAMA301" is being modified to
 return additional values in the print/display status field (request field
 #22).  This modification is transparent to sites.
  
  
 The Scheduling Replacement API "SDIMO^SDAMA203" is being modified to
 correctly evaluate an error code returned from a call to
 GETAPPT^SDAMA201. Full error processing is not implemented at sites yet,
 so this modification is transparent to sites.
