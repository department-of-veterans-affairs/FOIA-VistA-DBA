Description:
============

 Notes:
  
 1.  This patch MUST NOT be installed in your production accounts.  This 
     test version is only approved for testing in your test account.
  
 2.  This patch is intended to be tested with CPRS 26 or greater.  It will 
     not be released until after CPRS 26 has been released. Issues found   
     while testing with a prior version of CPRS will require confirmation 
     in CPRS 26 before they are addressed.
  
  
 ***
  
 This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration 
 (BCMA) Version 3.0.  The main function of PSB*3.0*13 and the 
 corresponding BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) software (BCMA Version 3
 Patch 13 [3.0.13]) is to support BCMA v3.0 Clinical Context Object 
 Workgroup (CCOW) compliance. The PSB*3.0*13 GUI and this Character User 
 Interface (CHUI) software (PSB*3.0*13) also support Patient Safety 
 Issues (PSI) and Remedy Ticket resolution and BCMA Coversheet refinement.
  
  
 ***
  
 1.   Problem: PSI-05-064
      BCMA functionality enables a BCMA user to edit the free text 
      BCMA MEDICATION LOG FILE-DISPENSE DRUG SUBFILE (# 53.795) "Units
      of Administration" (field #.04) for an administered medication, when 
      using the Edit Medication Log.  Consequently, the GUI Edit 
      Medication Log (Edit Med Log) allows a BCMA user to modify text in 
      the field labeled "Units" of the "BCMA - Edit Med Log" dialog box.  
      The user is able to change the "Units" from "PATCH" to any other text
      value.  Changing a "PATCH" medication to some other "Units", causes 
      BCMA to not process the administration properly; and causes the BCMA 
      Virtual Due List (VDL) to not present the administration properly.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The BCMA GUI Edit Med Log will not allow any BCMA user to edit the 
      BCMA MEDICATION LOG FILE/DISPENSE DRUG SUBFILE (# 53.795) "Units 
      of Administration" (field # .04) of an administered "PATCH" 
      medication.
  
 2.   Problem: PSI-06-019
      The VDL displays a GIVEN medication patch until it has been marked as
      "REMOVED".  This is causing some confusion to users.
  
      Corrective Action:
      BCMA will provide a site parameter that will specify the number of 
      days (7-14) a GIVEN patch will display on the VDL.  The count of 
      days the GIVEN patch displays on the VDL begins when the 
      medication order expires.  This parameter may be set to ""
      (null) or "ALWAYS DISPLAY" to allow GIVEN patches to display on the
      VDL until it is marked as REMOVED.
  
  
 3.   Problem: PSI-05-115
      The Special Instructions on the VDL will display the entire Special 
      Instructions by wrapping the text as needed using the spaces in the 
      Special Instructions. However, if a word or phrase (without spaces) 
      in the Special Instructions can not be wrapped due to the word or 
      phrase being longer then the width of the column, the text would be 
      truncated when the text ran into the right side of the column. In 
      addition, when the above happens, some of the ending words in the 
      special instructions may be omitted as well.
  
      Corrective Action:
      When a word or phrase (without spaces) can not be wrapped and does 
      not fit in the column width, the text will be truncated with an 
      ellipsis to indicate that a portion of the word or phrase was 
      truncated. The occasional omission of ending words in the special 
      instructions will be corrected. 
     
  
 4.   Problem:  HD0000000121694
      While a medication patch is being "administered" using Manual 
      Medication Entry[PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY], that particular scheduled 
      administration does not display on the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL).
  
      Corrective Action:
      Display the saved "action status" of an administration, while it is 
      being administered using Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
      ENTRY]
  
  
 5.   Problem:  HD0000000127625
      An error occurs when the BCMA coversheet is to display data for one 
      order only; and that order is an expired, large volume IV.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The BCMA Coversheet will display without error when the only order 
      information to display on the BCMA coversheet pertains to an expired,
      large volume IV.
  
  
 6.   Problem:  HD0000000132184
      An error occurs when the BCMA GUI Computerized Patient Record System 
      (CPRS)/BCMA Medication Order Button (MOB) is used and ORDER 
      File (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) data does not link to a 
      WARD LOCATION File (#42) entry.
      
      Corrective Action:
      BCMA will provide HOSPITAL LOCATION File (#44) data per ORDER File 
      (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) data when the CPRS/BCMA MOB is 
      used.  CPRS will use ORDER File (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) 
      data to map to a HOSPITAL LOCATION File (#44) entry. 
      
  
  
 7.   Enhancement:  CCOW compliancy
      This patch (PSB*3.0*13) will enable BCMA CCOW compliancy.
  
  
 8.   Enhancement:  Enhanced "*UNKNOWN* Action Status" support.
      BCMA Medication Log File (File #53.79) entries having unknown 
      Action Status (field #.09) data can be maintained via the GUI BCMA 
      Edit Med Log only. These entries may be maintained by persons holding
      the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] or that user unable to complete 
      the original administration.  PSB*3.0*13 supports the VISTA "Unknown 
      Action Status Report" option [PSBO XA].  The [PSBO XA] option 
      provides persons holding the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] 
      resource to generate a report to display BCMA Medication Log File 
      (#53.79) entries having "unknown" Action Status (field #.09) data.  
      Users holding the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] can access the 
      PSBO XA report via the BCMA GUI as well.  BCMA has been enhanced to 
      display a "pop-up box" when a user begins an action on an order 
      which has had recent "unknown" activity.
  
  
 9.   Enhancement:  Saved Coversheet Personal Parameters
      PSB*3.0*13 will maintain personal parameters per BCMA Coversheet 
      views to be saved and retrieved when using BCMA.
