 This multi-build patch contains four Provider Systems patches to support 
 Code Set Versioning under the Health Information Portability and 
 Accountability Act (HIPAA). These patches should be installed together 
 under a single KIDS build: CSV_PS_1_0.KID
  
 The four patches included in this single KIDS build are:
                   LR*5.2*297       CSV-Laboratory
                   RA*5.0*38        CSV-Radiology
                   RMPR*3.0*74      CSV-Prosthetics
                   SR*3.0*116       CSV-Surgery
  
 They contain routines, templates, and data dictionary changes to 
 recognize code sets for CPT and/or ICD9 codes. Please refer to the 
 individual patch descriptions to get the names of the documentation files.

 The HIPAA regulations mandate that federally recognized code sets used in 
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) must accommodate translation for 
 Standards Development Organizations (SDO) established codes according to 
 the date when the code and narrative description were established.  
  
 The data screening of code sets will be modified, to ensure that the code 
 sets are active on the date of treatment or service. These code sets 
 include:
  
  - ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical 
    Modifications)
  
  - CPT-4 (Clinical Procedure Terminology-4)
  
 1. Modifications shall be made to assure CPT codes, CPT Modifiers, and
    ICD-9 codes are active codes for the treatment service date with the
    following conditions:
  
  - Only CPT and ICD-9 codes that are active for the operation or procedure
    date shall be selectable by the user, regardless of when the entry or 
    edit is made.
  - Active CPT and ICD-9 codes for the current code set version shall be 
    selectable by the user when a future operation or procedure date is 
    entered.
  - CPT and ICD-9 codes shall be re-validated whenever the TIME PAT IN OR 
    field (#.205) or the TIME PROCEDURE BEGAN field (#121) in the SURGERY 
    file (#130) is entered. If the documented CPT and ICD-9 codes are still
    active, the CPT and ICD-9 codes shall remain unchanged. If the
    documented CPT or ICD-9 codes are no longer active, they shall be
    deleted. If the CPT or ICD-9 codes are deleted, a warning shall be
    displayed on the screen to the user.
  
 2. The CPT and ICD-9 validation is added to the following options:
  
  - Make a Request for Concurrent Cases [SRSREQCC]
  - Make a Request from the Waiting List [SRSWREQ]
  - Delete or Update Operation Requests [SRSUPRQ]
  - Schedule Unrequested Operations [SROSRES]
  - Reschedule or Update a Scheduled Operation [SRSCHUP]
  - Operation [SROMEN-OP]
  - Operation Startup [SROMEN-START]
  - Post Operation [SROMEN-POST]
  - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT]
  - Surgeon's Verification of Diagnosis & Procedures [SROVER]
  - Edit Non-O.R. Procedure [SRONOP-EDIT]
  - Operation Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA OPERATION DATA]
  - Postoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO POSTOP COMP]
  - Intraoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO INTRAOP COMP]
  - Update/Verify Procedures/Diagnosis Codes [SRCODING EDIT]
  - Non-Operative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SROCOMP] 
  - Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC RESOURCE] 
  
 Data Dictionary Changes:
 ========================
 This patch modifies the following fields:
  
  - PRIN DIAGNOSIS CODE field (#66), OTHER RESPIRATORY OCCURRENCE field 
    (#253), OTHER URINARY TRACT OCCURRENCE field (#286), OTHER CNS
    OCCURRENCE field (#343), OTHER CARDIAC OCCURRENCE field (#344), 
    and OTHER OCCURRENCES (ICD9) field (#392) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE sub-field (#3) in the OTHER PREOP DIAGNOSIS
    multiple (#.72) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE sub-field (#3) in the OTHER POSTOP DIAGS
    multiple (#.74) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE sub-field (#4) in the INTRAOPERATIVE OCCURRENCES
    multiple (#1.14) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE sub-field (#6) in the POSTOP OCCURRENCE multiple
    (#1.16) of the SURGERY file (#130).
  
  - New "AD" MUMPS cross-references is added to the TIME PAT IN OR field
    (#.205) and "ADA" cross-reference to the TIME PROCEDURE BEGAN field
    (#121) in the SURGERY file (#130) to invoke the revalidation of the CPT
    and ICD-9 codes whenever any of those fields is edited.
