Subject: Enhancements to AUDIOMETRIC EXAM module

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses several issues that came up at the VAMC stations as
 a result of the initial release of the Audiometric Exam Module (patch
 ACKQ*3.0*3). These changes have been made to the GUI(Windows based)
 Enter/Edit(ACKQROES3E.EXE) and Display(ACKQROES3.EXE) applications in the
 package for both the CPRS Toolbar and Desktop versions, as well as to the
 VistA part of the application. The VistA part includes the file data
 dictionary, Remote Procedure Calls and routines.
  
 The Audiometric Exam Module was developed in conjunction with the Remote
 Order Entry System (ROES 3.0) at the VA Denver Distribution Center(DDC)
 and is only available to run in the Windows environment. ROES 3.0 order
 processing incorporates patient-specific audiometric information from the
 Audiometric Exam Module and provides end users with order entry and
 display capabilities that include this audiometric information.  It is
 not required, but is highly recommended, that ROES*3.0 be installed along
 with ACKQ*3.0*12, if it is not already in place.
  
 The Audiometric Exam Module can be installed completely from this patch,
 if ACKQ*3.0*3 was not previously installed. Users are encouraged to
 consult the full Installation Guide referenced below if AKCQ*3.0*3 was not
 installed. If ACKQ*3.0*3 was installed, then installing the KIDS build and
 copying the new executables over the original executables of the same name
 will complete the install.

  Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
  ----------------------------
  Problem: When a user without context accessed the Edit Module, they were
  allowed to enter the application and view the screens. They were not able
  to actually edit the data.
  
  Solution: The application [ACKQROES3E.EXE] was modified to exit and halt
  the application if the user did not have the appropriate VistA
  application assigned to create context.
  
  Associated Remedy Ticket: HD000000063808
  
  -----
  Problem: Sites encountered a Null Subscript at EN2+4^ACKQAG02 when
  entering a new record and cancels out of entering the date and time of
  the exam.
  
  Solution: A fix is applied in routine ACKQAG02 and in the record setup
  to give the appropriate error message and exit the application if a valid
  date and time are not entered.
  
  Associated Remedy Tickets: HD000000063675 and HD000000063875
  
  -----
  Problem: Some error messages or message prompts were coming up behind
  other screens. The only way for them to show up was to select the
  application from the bottom task bar.
  
  Solution: Most of the messages in the Audiogram Edit application are now
  enclosed in code to send them to topmost position and after the message
  ends, to restore the previous topmost setup.  This may not be a complete
  solution, but available documentation indicates it should help, if not
  eliminate the problem from this application.

 This patch contains the following enhancements:
 ===============================================
  
 The Audiometric Exam Module provided new functionality for Audiology and
 Speech Pathology Services(ASPS), to simplify and enhance the entry,
 display and use of information obtained during the Audiometric exam of a
 patient. This module is comprised of two distinct application functions:
         Audiogram Edit function [ACKQROES3E.EXE]
         Audiogram Display function [ACKQROES3.EXE]
  
 Records are stored in the local AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file (^ACK(509850.9).
 When signed, the records are also transmitted from this global to the DDC
 through the VistA Mailman system. At the DDC, data from these records is
 included with orders for hearing aids and repairs when the orders are
 placed through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package.
 They may also be viewed remotely from the ROES Patient Information screen
 of the ROES web application.
  
 ACKQ*3.0*12 implements the following changes:
  
  1. Removal of Buttons
  In both audiogram GUI applications, the buttons previously on the screens
  have been replaced by menu options at the top of the form.
  
  2. Loop to Another Patient or Record
  In both applications, a menu option (Get New Record) has been added to
  allow the user to go to another record without exiting the application.
  If accessing through CPRS, record selection is limited to the current
  patient. From the Desktop application, users may select another patient
  or go to another record for the same patient.
  
  3. Comments
  A comment box has been added to the Edit application where the clinician
  can enter up to 300 characters of text. A checkbox has been inserted
  directly above the comment area for use if the clinician would like to
  automatically insert the words "NOT ADEQUATE FOR RATING PURPOSES". This
  text will be saved to the file and will be imported into VA form 10-2364.
  
  4. Update VA form 10-2364
  VA form 10 2364 has been modified to reflect the changes made to the form
  since the release of patch ACKQ*3.0*3. The comment section of the form is
  no longer editable.
  
  5. Color Changes
  Color has been removed from the data entry boxes. This allows for a
  cleaner presentation and makes more of the screen available for the edit
  boxes.
  
  6. Retransmit Audiogram
  In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow
  retransmission of a signed audiogram.  This is necessary to transfer the
  speech, word and other readings that were not a part of the original
  transmission.
  
  7. Removing Audiogram
  In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow deletion
  of a signed audiogram. This became necessary because, in their haste to
  enter audiograms under heavy workload pressures, users sometimes entered
  audiograms under the wrong patient and the error was not discovered until
  after transmission. This would then become a problem when data would be
  on duplicate systems for the wrong patient. After installing this patch,
  when a local signed audiogram is deleted, a message with identifying
  information is sent to the DDC to delete the record there also.
  Clinicians should use utmost caution in both entering and removing
  audiograms.
  
  8. File Changes
  Numerous fields were added to the AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file to provide the
  additional data needed for diagnostic and reporting purposes. The data
  type of many fields was changed at the request of the national program
  office to more efficiently handle the text and tags required in the
  fields. Many that were numeric are now free text. Refer to the
  CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO FILE section for more detailed information.
  
  9. New Fields on Edit Pages
  The new editable fields (bullet 8) and data type screening were added to
  the Edit program.
  
  10. Masking Change
  Masking is no longer referenced in the fields with an '*', but will
  instead be indicated by a non-zero numeric value in the 'Masking Level'
  field. Prior instances of the data without a masking level will continue
  to display the '*' sign.
  
  11. No Response Change
  The symbol for 'No Response'(+) will now be stored in the text field with
  the numeric value.
  
  12. No Testing, No Masking
  'CNM', 'CNT', 'DNT' and 'FLAT; are now accommodated in the appropriate
  text fields in the file as well as in the Edit program.
  
  13. Transducer Type
  Users can now indicate if testing was done via inserts or headphones.
  This is also displayed on the 10-2364.
  
  14. Eliminate Duplicate Presentation and Material
  One selection of the Presentation Method and Material are now applicable
  to all of the Word Recognition tests, via a single drop down list.
  
  15. Tympanogram Type and Other Test
  Tympanogram Type and 'Other Test' types have been added to the Acoustic
  Immittance page.
  
  16. Claim Number
  The Claim Number has been added to the Edit form so that it can be
  included on VA form 10-2364.
  
  17. Maximum Value Change
  Maximum values allowed have been updated and associated 'Hints' have been
  adjusted.
  
  18. Hints
  It is now possible for the user to inactivate or reactivate the hint
  feature.
  
  19. Clinician Title
  The title of the clinician and location will now show on the display.
  
  20. Presentation Method
  CD and Tape have been consolidated into a single Recorded type.
  
  21. About Box
  An 'About' box was added to the main forms to comply with VistA
  convention.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  Installation of this patch will take about 5 minutes. Additional
  time will be needed if the GUI applications have been installed on
  individual client machines or the location of the applications on the
  network has changed. Users need not be off the system when applying this
  patch, but it should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
  disruption to users.
  
   1. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
      options as desired:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
  
   2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
      option to install the patch:
         Install Package(s) (ACKQ*3.0*12)
  
   3. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//", respond 'NO'.
  
   4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
      respond 'NO'.
  
   5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
