Description:
============

 This patch reformats the attending MD name for HL7 segments,
 fixes the sort template for NPTF reports, and provides a list
 of records with bad SSNs.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1) ISP-0704-N0995     attending physician name formatting
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Patch DG*5.3*494 made a modification to the HL7 segment building routine
 VAFHAPV1 to use Kernel API $$HLNAME^XLFNAME instead of $$HLNAME^HLFNC 
 when reformatting the name of the attending physician for HL7 
 transmissions.  The change needed to be made in two places but was 
 only done in one. 
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine VAFHAPV1 was modified to make the second change.
  
 2) ISH-0804-40371     NPTF Reports broken
  
 Problem:
 ========
 There are two NPTF specific reports in options [DG NPTF HL7 REPORT (ASK 
 DATES] and [DG NPTF HL7 REPORT (YESTERDAY)] but they don't produce
 any output. All attempts display "** No records to print **".  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The sort template [DG NPTF TOTALS] which is used by both reports
 was corrected.  The reports will now display a count of the number of 
 NPTF transmissions (ADT/HL7) sent to Austin.  This enables the 
 sites to verify that transmissions are flowing, and provides a 
 statistic of the number sent each day.  (These transmissions should
 not be confused with Mailman messages to Austin when PTF records are
 closed and transmitted). 
  
 3) MAC-0200-62435     Bad SSN filter prior to creation of SSN 
    ISP-0804-N0471     PSEUDO SSN FOR PATIENTS WITH NO DOB
  
 Problem:
 ========
 In the past, records were sometimes created in the Patient file (#2) 
 without a date of birth.  In these instances, a bogus pseudo SSN
 was generated by the system consisting of only 4 characters 
 which caused problems when re-indexing the "BS" cross-reference.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DGRPDD1 was modified to use "1900" for a date of birth.
 This would translate into a pseudo SSN ending in "---000000P".
  
 Another routine DG53P621 is included with this patch which will
 provide sites with a list of patients (if any) with bogus SSNs.
 (Please see the Post-Install instructions)
 These records can then be corrected using the Eligibility Verification 
 [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION] option under the Registration Menu
 [DG REGISTRATION MENU].
 First update the date of birth.  If it is not known, please enter '1900'.
 Then update the SSN by entering 'P' in order to generate a proper
 pseudo SSN.  Note that you must always enter 'P' to update the SSN
 even if you didn't have to change the date of birth.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*621):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport Global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*621.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
   
  Execute post-install routine DG53P621.  The report should be queued
  because the routine reads through the entire Patient file.
