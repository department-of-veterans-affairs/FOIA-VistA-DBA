Subject: MPI Direct Connect Undefined Error

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Test sites:    MPI
  
 NOIS:          ISF-0102-62265
  
 Note:          This patch requires that KIDS build HL*1.6*43
                be installed.
  
 The Master Patient Index (MPI) system sometimes experiences an undefined 
 error at MPIDIRQ+5^MPIDIRQ.  The undefined variable is the local variable 
 TMP("HCSI",$J,1).  Inadequate coding in the Health Level Seven (HL7) 
 package's direct connect software is the cause of this problem.  Patch 
 HL*1.6*89 fixes this undefined error condition.
  
 The routine HLCSAS is included in this patch.  The first and second
 lines of this routine are shown below.

 The VA Kernel checksum for the routine included in this patch
 (calculated using CHECK^XTSUMBLD) is listed below.

 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums after patch
 installation.
  
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
    NOTICE:  Do not proceed unless patch HL*1.6*43 has been installed.
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  AXP/DSM SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If the
        routine listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section is mapped, it
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options
        listed below.
  
           Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
           TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
       AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this
       installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. This is done using the 'Installation' menu's 'Install
        Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD]' menu option. When using this
        menu option to install the patch build, you will be asked
        several questions.  The questions, and the answers you should
        supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*89>
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
  
    6.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
       AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: If you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
       for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
    7.  AXP/DSM Sites:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
        map set, if necessary.
  
    8.  Start Link Manager using the 'TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
        START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
