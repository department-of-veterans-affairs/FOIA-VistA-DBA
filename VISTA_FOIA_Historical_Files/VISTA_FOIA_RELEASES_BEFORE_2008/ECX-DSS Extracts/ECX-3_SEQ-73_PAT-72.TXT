   Prior to installing the host file, it is strongly recommended that sites
   run the following reports -
     SD CLN STOP CODE REP...   Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report
     ECX CLN STOP REP...       DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report
 
   Run the reports, selecting the Active Clinics.  It is highly recommended
   that all non-conforming clinics be corrected prior to installing the host
   file.  Although it is not absolutely necessary to correct these clinics
   before installation, use of clinics with non-conforming stop codes will
   not be permitted after the installation.

 Introduction
 ============
 The Deputy Director of Health Administration Center (HAC) DSS, requested
 enhancements to VistA to implement an electronic means of restricting
 medical centers from entering secondary DSS stop codes, also known as
 DSS Identifiers, in the primary DSS stop code position and to prevent
 stations from using stop codes in the secondary position that should be
 primary only.
  
  
 Technical
 ---------
 Decision Support System application was modified to check the associated 
 clinic of an encounter to ensure that its corresponding stop pairs 
 conform to the stop code restriction.  The following components were affected:-
   
 o  The DSS STOP CODE Field #3 was updated in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES,
    File #728.44 to ensure that only a primary stop code can be entered into
    the field.  It also checks that a stop code cannot be used before its
    restriction date.
 o  The DSS CREDIT STOP CODE Field #4 was updated in the CLINICS AND STOP 
    CODES, LOCATION, File #728.44 to ensure that only a secondary stop code 
    can be entered into the field.  It also checks that a stop code cannot
    be used before its restriction date.
 o  DSS was added as a subscriber to IA#4652 to use API $$CLNCK^SDUTL2.

 =========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system, however it should
 be installed during off hours to minimize disruption to users.  Installation 
 will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 Note: The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this multi-package
       distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
       without the prior installation of them.
  
          EC*2.0*54      EC*2.0*55      ECX*3.0*60     PX*1.0*147

  1. Download the KIDS file RSC_2_0.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
     directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the
     appropriate directory on your system.
  
  2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
     enter: RSC_2_0.KID
  
  3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
