Subject: KIDS Patient Merge Modifications

Category:

 =============================================================================
  
   This patch can be installed with users on the system, but no other users
   should be using KIDS while you install this patch.
  
   Since this patch is an update to KIDS, no other patches should be 
   installed during the installation of this patch.
 
      ****** This patch must be QUEUED during the install process ******
  
 ===========================================================================
 
  INSTALLATION:
 
    1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
        system.
        You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the Transport 
        global.
    4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and 
        installed at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3  Print Transport Global
           4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5  Backup a Transport Global
           6  Install Package(s)
                INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*83
                              =========
    6.  At the device prompt, make sure you queue the install:
                DEVICE: HOME// QUEUE TO PRINT ON
                               =
    7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
