Subject: PSI-07-075 modify error message

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will provide a temporary fix as detailed in Patient safety 
 issue PSI-07-075 for BCMA.  
  
 When using the CPRS Med Order Button (MOB), it was discovered that certain
 hardware configurations allow a "virtual" IP address.  This causes a
 single user to be logged into two physical nodes simultaneously.  When
 this happens, the order placed in CPRS MOB cannot be filed.  The user
 receives an error box which states "Missing data, unable to file."  The
 order does not show up on the VDL. It was determined that there is risk of
 duplication when the order does not file.
  
 This patch will modify the error message to make it more noticeable and 
 robust.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:

 HD187592 -- Med order button orders evaporating
  
  
 Problem
 -------
 When using the CPRS Med Order Button (MOB), it was discovered that certain
 hardware configurations allow a "virtual" IP address.  This causes a
 single user to be logged into two physical nodes simultaneously.  When
 this happens, the order placed in CPRS MOB cannot be filed.  The user
 receives an error box which states "Missing data, unable to file."  The
 order does not show up on the VDL. It was determined that there is risk of
 duplication when the order does not file.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 This patch addresses one of the temporary solutions to this issue: 
 modifying the error message so that it is more descriptive and 
 noticeable.  The text of the error message will be changed from "Missing 
 data, unable to file" to:
  
 "YOUR ORDER WAS NOT SAVED. EXIT BCMA, SIGN BACK IN, THEN TRY AGAIN."
  
  
 Technical Resolution
 --------------------
 Routine PSJHL10 will be modified at line 15.  The text of the variable 
 PSREASON will be changed as above.
