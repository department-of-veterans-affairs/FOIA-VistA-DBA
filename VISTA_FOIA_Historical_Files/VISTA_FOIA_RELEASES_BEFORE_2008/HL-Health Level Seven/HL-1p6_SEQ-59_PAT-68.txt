Description: 
============

 Patch HL*1.6*68
  
 NOIS: MIW-0900-41651
 Test Site: Milwaukee, WI; Grand Junction, CO
 This patch 'news' variables in routine ^HLCSMM so that they do not leak out
 and cause problems.  ^HLCSMM uses MailMan to send HL7 messages for MailMan
 type Logical Links.
  
 The following improvements are also made:
  
 1. Ignores domain closures and security key requirements, so that it will
 send to FOC-AUSTIN, even if that domain is closed or has a security key.
  
 2. Sites may again use the auto-startup feature for MailMan type Logical
 Links.  If DUZ is 0 or undefined, DUZ will be set to .5 (POSTMASTER), for
 the purpose of sending the messages.
  
 3. Error message has been improved.  If the message is not sent for some
 reason, the error message will clearly state the reason why.  Sites are
 reminded to ensure that the mail group which receives error messages is
 populated.  To do this:
  
 W $$PARAM^HLCS2.  Piece 8 should be the name of a mail group.  You should 
 be in that mail group.  This group receives error messages if there's any 
 problems in creating the HL7 MailMan messages.  The subject is
 "Error handing HL7 message off to Mailman".
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when activity is at
 a minimum.  It requires HL7 patch HL*1.6*66.
