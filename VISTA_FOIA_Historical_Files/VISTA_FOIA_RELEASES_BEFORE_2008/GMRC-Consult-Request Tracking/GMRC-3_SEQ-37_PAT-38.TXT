 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 
 1. ANC-1003-51979     SF 513 print problem with Interfacility consults
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user prints/displays a SF 513 for an Inter-Facility Consult (IFC)
    the "Entered at: " location prompt, for added comments, was displaying
    the wrong facility.  This was caused by using the ROUTING FACILITY (#.07)
    field of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file to provide the answer.
    For an IFC, this field always indicated the other facility.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    To correct this issue, the ROUTING FACILITY (#.07) field of the
    REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file is used to identify the remote facility
    when the comment was not entered locally.  When a comment was added
    locally, the institution entered in the Kernel parameters is used to
    identify the local facility.
  
 2. PUG-0804-51625     Extraneous text pulled into det display(TRANSIENT)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported the extraneous text, "Clinical Procedure Report", was
    periodically displaying during the detailed display of consults.  This
    ranged from just a few lines to thousands of pages in length.  It was
    discovered the reason for this was related to invalid data existing in
    a temporary global prior to running a detailed display.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    To correct this problem the data stored at ^TMP("GMRCR",$J,"CP") will
    be deleted by a kill command at the beginning of the detailed display
    code execution.  This will ensure any data stored at this location
    was created by the detailed display code and is supposed to be there.
