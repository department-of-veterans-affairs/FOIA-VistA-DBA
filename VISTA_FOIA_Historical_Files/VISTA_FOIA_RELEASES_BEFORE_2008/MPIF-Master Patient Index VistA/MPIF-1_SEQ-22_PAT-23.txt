Run Date: JUL 24, 2002                     Designation: MPIF*1*23
Package : MPIF - MASTER PATIENT INDEX VISTA Priority: Mandatory
Version : 1        SEQ #22                      Status: Released

Subject: SPI ACTION NAME CHANGE AND TF LIST ERROR IN SPI AND DISPLAY ONLY QUERY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  
   NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
   avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
   of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
   Issue 1:  It was reported in NOIS HWH-0702-40470 and in an e-mail from
   Madison that when the Treating Facility list is more than x sites an 
   undefined can result.  A maximum of 25 sites can now be returned.  If
   the display is 25 sites a note will follow saying that there could be
   more but only the first 25 will be displayed.  Most patients aren't
   shared at more than 25 sites.  This display will only impact Single
   Patient Initialization to MPI [MPIF IND MPI LOAD], MPI Data View action
   (MPI) and the Display Only Query [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI]
   options.
  
   Issue 2:  E3R request #17356 asked that the ADD and SE actions on the
   Single Patient Initialization to MPI [MPIF IND MPI LOAD] option be
   modified in their appearance only.  Action ADD Add Patient to MPI has
   been replaced by NEW Create NEW National ICN.  The NEW action is now on
   the top left (where SP use to be).  Action SP Select Patient from List
   has been replaced by SE Match with Existing Pt on List.  The SE action 
   is now on the top right (where ADD use to be).  The help text has
   been updated to reflect these new action names.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Via TaskMan, unschedule the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] if it is scheduled to run 
        during installation of this patch.
  
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*23.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
   10.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Inactivate Patient from MPI             [MPIF PAT INACT]
         Single Patient Initialization to MPI    [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]
         Display Only Query              [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] 
         Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
         10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
         Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
         Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
         Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
    
      
   11.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
  
  
   12.  Reschedule, via TaskMan, the Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
        Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] if unscheduled in step 4.
