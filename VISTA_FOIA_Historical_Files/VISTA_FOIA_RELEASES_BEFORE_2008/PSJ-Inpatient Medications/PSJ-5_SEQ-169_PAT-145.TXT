Subject: MAR REPORT: NEW PROMPTS AND CHANGES TO FORMAT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Sites reported that location designation for inpatients who received
 orders in a clinic was incorrect. In some cases the clinic location was
 overwriting the ward location designation. In many instances an error
 appeared in the routine PSGMAR1 for printing the 24 hr MAR.
  
 This patch corrects this issue by adding new prompts to aid in printing
 out orders for both ward locations and clinics. No location designations
 are overwritten. When printing by Ward Group/Patient, or by Ward/Patient,
 all orders for a patient are grouped together by the patient's name
 regardless of location. HD84581, HD94525, HD94701, HD94753, HD94951,

 The following prompts are included when printing by Ward, Ward Group,
 Clinic, or Clinic Group.

 2. After the installation of PSJ*5.0*111 and PSJ*5.0*131, the formatting
 on the MAR reports was adversely affected. Sites reported pagination was
 off, pages displayed too much empty space, and the signature block no
 longer appeared at the bottom of each page.
  
 Code modifications have been made in the MAR routines to correct the
 formatting problems. Page numbering has been corrected.  The signature
 block prints at the end of each page. Non-clinic and
 clinic orders will display in the correct location on
 the MAR report. Orders with a stop date/time greater than or equal to the
 selected 24 Hour MAR start date/time will print out correctly. HD94303,
