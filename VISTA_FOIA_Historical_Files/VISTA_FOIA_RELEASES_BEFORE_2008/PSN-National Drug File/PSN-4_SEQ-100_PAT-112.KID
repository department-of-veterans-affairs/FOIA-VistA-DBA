The input transform on the VUID field (#99.99) in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file
"BLD",5625,1,3,0)
(#50.416) became corrupted in such a way that editing that field would cause
"BLD",5625,1,4,0)
a syntax error.  That field is not edited at VAMCs.  This patch corrects
"BLD",5625,1,5,0)
the syntax of that input transform.
