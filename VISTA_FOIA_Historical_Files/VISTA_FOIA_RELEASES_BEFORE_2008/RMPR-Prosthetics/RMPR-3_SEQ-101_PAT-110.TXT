 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. Type of Transaction (Item Type) missing in Extract.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the Home Oxygen module when adding O2 patients using option
 Add/Edit Home Oxygen Patient or in option Billing Transactions
 (action: Edit Patient or Edit Billing) the Item Type were not required 
 fields and allowed to be skipped.  This was found when DSS tried to 
 run a monthly extract for Prosthetics.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPOPED and RMPOBIL2 to make Item Type
 required when adding an O2 patient or Add Patient/Editing Billing on
 Billing Transactions template.
  
  
  
 2. HOME O2/SUSPENSE ISSUE. When using the action XB Post Billing on
    the Billing Transaction template the posting sets the incorrect link
    between the HOME OXYGEN TRANSACTIONS FILE (#665.72) and the
    RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCES/REPAIR FILE (#660).  This caused subsequent
    anomalies when viewing the 1358 for the patient's O2 posting and 
    displays records not linked to Suspense.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the action XB Post Billing on the Billing Transaction template 
 the posting sets the incorrect link between the HOME OXYGEN TRANSACTIONS
 FILE (#665.72) and the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCES/REPAIR FILE (#660).  This
 caused subsequent anomalies when viewing the 1358 for the patient's O2
 posting and display of records not linked to Suspense. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPRPS23 and RMPOPST3 to insure the correct pointer
 to item in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCES/REPAIR FILE (#660) is stuffed
 into the HOME OXYGEN TRANSACTIONS FILE (#665.72).
