Subject: Broker Security Enhancement

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  This patch is part of the Broker Security Enhancement (in conjunction 
  with patch XWB*1.1*45).
   
  **************************  NOTE  **************************************
          Patch XWB*1.1*45 must be installed before this patch.
          
       Broker Signon(s) should not be permitted during installation
                   (XUSRB errors could result)
  ************************************************************************
   
  The concept of a visitor signon from a remote GUI application was 
  initially requested and used by the CAPRI program. It permits Veterans 
  Benefits Administration (VBA) support personnel to access records for 
  determination of service connected status.  This type of access has also
  been used by VistaWeb and requested by other applications.
   
  This patch provides this type of access to those programs that can 
  justify its use, while increasing the security to insure that the access 
  is not used by rogue applications.
   
  A new file (REMOTE APPLICATION, #8994.5) is created by this patch.  
  Any application using this type of access must create an entry for itself 
  in the REMOTE APPLICATION file.  That entry will contain the one-way hash 
  value for a security phrase known only to the application and the context 
  option, which users should have.  In addition, there is a sub-file containing 
  information on how to contact the authenticating server. Most applications 
  that will implement the Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) are expected 
  to have a central application server where the users will be authenticated;   
  although, VistaWeb will still depend upon authentication of users at their 
  individual home VistA sites.  The address and port number for the 
  application servers and a mechanism for connecting to them will be 
  specified in the  sub-file.  The remote server will connect with the 
  authenticating server and obtain the information for the visiting user 
  directly.
   
  An application that wants to use BSE access will have to have a KIDS 
  build installed on the remote system(s) to generate the entry in the 
  REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5).  Access for entry into the file will 
  be via the one-way hash of the security phrase; thus, unauthorized 
  applications would not be able to access the systems by mimicking the 
  authorized application unless they had direct access to the security 
  phrase itself.  For more information on BSE please refer to the 'RPC 
  Broker Technical Manual' version 1.1 (Patch XWB*1.1*45) and the 'Broker 
  Security Enhancement (BSE) Supplement to Patch Description',
  which will be located on the Anonymous Directories and on the VDL at: 
  http://www.va.gov/vdl/Infrastructure.asp?appID=23.
  
  
  This patch contains the following:
  
   * Three (3) M routines
   * Two (2) entries in the REMOTE PROCEDURE FILE ("XUS SET VISITOR" and
     "XUS GET VISITOR").
  
  Patch XWB*1.1*45 must be installed prior to installation of this patch.
   
  In order to implement BSE and use the RPC-Broker callback type, the central
  Authenticating VistA M server must run the RPC Broker as a TCPIP service.
  The Non-callback RPC Broker Listener/TCPIP service is distributed and 
  described with RPC Broker Patch XWB*1.1*35 and updated with XWB*1.1*44.

  Installation Instructions:
  
       1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
       installation.
  
       2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
       This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
       System) package onto your system.
  
       3.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
       4.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
       system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
       the following options:
             Verify Checksums in Transport Global
             Print Transport Global
             Compare Transport Global to Current System
             Backup a Transport Global
  
             Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
             Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":
             Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                 =======
              Install Package(s)
              Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*404
                                   ==========
  
          Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// YES
                                                                ===
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
