 1. HD0000000068817   ISW-0205-20756  Deploy standard name for Home
                      Telehealth consult
    Problem:
    --------
    The Home Telehealth project group has requested a new Service be
    created entitled:
  
        CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH SCREENING
  
    In addition to this, the Registration package needed to access Consult
    information in support of the Home Telehealth project.  An API (DBIA
    #3252) to return the needed information already existed, but would only
    accept the Consult Service IEN as input.  They needed it to accept the
    Consult Service Name as well, in order for them to use it.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new Consult Service will be created in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5)
    file and a modification will be made to the existing API (DBIA #3252) to
    allow it to use the Consult Service name as well as the Consult Service
    IEN.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 The Consult Service will be added via the pre-installation routine,
 PRE^GMRCYP42.  This routine will either create a new entry or it will
 overwrite an existing entry in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file.  If
 overwritten, only the fields listed below will by modified while other
 existing entries in fields not listed below will remain unchanged.  The
 Consult Service is being exported to support the Home Telehealth project.
 The Consult Service will contain the following settings:
  
    SERVICE NAME: CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH SCREENING
    SERVICE USAGE: DISABLED
    PRINT NAME: CCHT SC
    PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT: OPTIONAL
    PROVISIONAL DX INPUT: LEXICON
    RESTRICT DEFAULT REASON EDIT: UNRESTRICTED
    SYNONYM: CCHT SCRN
    INTERNAL NAME: CCHT SCREENING
    OE/RR DISPLAY GROUP: CONSULTS
    PROTOCOL ACTION MENU BY USERS: GMRCACTM SERVICE ACTION MENU
    DEFAULT REASON FOR REQUEST: Initial Screening for Home Telehealth
                                services.
  
  
 An environment check routine, ^GMRCYP42, will identify any existing
 services that partially or exactly match the one being imported.
 Upon identification of any partial or exact matches, the service name is
 reported to the installer.  The environment check routine advises the
 installing person to abort installation if the environment check
 identifies a potential conflict.  All messages from the environment
 check are available for later review by using the Install File Print
 [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] option and printing install name GMRC*3.0*42.
  
 What to do if the environment check identifies a partial match:
  
 1) Review the service identified as being a partial match.
 2) Determine if the existing service should be disabled based on whether
    the incoming service will replace it.
 3) Remember, ONLY the imported service name will be recognized by the
    Home Telehealth software.
 4) If the existing service should remain active in addition to the new
    service, the warning may be ignored.
  
  
 What to do if the environment check identifies an exact match:
  
 1) If an exact match was found for the service being installed, the
    existing service will be overwritten with the new service settings
    listed above.  If the values in the existing service must be
    maintained, the name of the existing service MUST be changed.
  
 2) Any changes to the name of a service MUST be done via the Set up
    Consult Services [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] option.  Changing
    the name of a service via VA FileManager can have negative effects
    on the ordering of Consults in CPRS.
  
 ************************************************************************
 WARNING: The use of VA FileManager for editing of the REQUEST SERVICES
          (#123.5) file is highly discouraged.  Specific safeguards are
          in place when utilizing the Set up Request Services [GMRC SETUP
          REQUEST SERVICES] option.  These safeguards are not present
          when using Fileman.
 ************************************************************************
  
  
 The post-installation routine, POST^GMRCYP42, will add the new Consult
 Service as a sub-service to ALL SERVICES.
  
  
 Routine GMRCASV1, the GUI tag entry point, is being modified to accept the
 Consult Service name (#.01) field, as well as the Consult Service IEN of the
 REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file, as a valid input.  It previously would only
 accept the Consult Service IEN as input.  The routine will attempt to find a
 Consult Service name with an exact match to the input.  If one is not found,
 then the routine will attempt to match the input to a Consult Service IEN
 and continue processing as it always has.
  
 ************************************************************************
 WARNING: The basis of the interface between Consult/Request Tracking and
          Registration is the name of the Consult service.  Since the
          name of the service is critical to the stability of the
          interface, the new service name must not be edited.
 ************************************************************************

      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this

 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 1) When your site is prepared to use the Consult service provided in this
    patch, the DISABLED entry in the SERVICE USAGE field should be deleted.
    Again, this change should be done using the Set up Consult Services
    [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] option.  If you chose to install the
    service over an existing service that matched exactly, THIS STEP MUST
    BE PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY.
  
 2) Any user that should receive notifications can be configured in one of 
    the fields in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file.  Details of which 
    fields to configure can be found in the Consult/Request Tracking
    Technical Manual available from the VistA Documentation Library (VDL)
    at http://www.va.gov/vdl/Clinical.asp?appID=62. 
  
 3) If automatic printing of requests to this service should occur, a
    VistA printer should be entered in field #123.09 SERVICE PRINTER. 
  
 4) During the installation the service was made a sub-service of ALL
    SERVICES.  If you want it to be arranged differently within your
    Consult hierarchy, that will need to be done after installation.
