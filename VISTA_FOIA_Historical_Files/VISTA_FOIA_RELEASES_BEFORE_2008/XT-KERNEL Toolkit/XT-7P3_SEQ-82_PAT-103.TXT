Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
  In a RDPC environment, purging the HTM and COM files from the VMS
  directory after ftp file transfer was not occuring due to the disk
  naming convention used.
  
  In this routine, which controls the local FTP to a web server, after
  ftp file transfer has completed a batch process is run to delete the
  files left in the VMS directory.
  
  Due to the disk naming convention used at a RDPC site, the file deletion
  was not occurring.  This patch corrects this problem.
