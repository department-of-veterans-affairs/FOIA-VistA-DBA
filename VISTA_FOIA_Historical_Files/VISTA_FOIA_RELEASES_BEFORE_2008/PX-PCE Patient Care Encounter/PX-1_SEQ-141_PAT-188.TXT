Subject: FIX ERROR IF NO PATIENT SELECTED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix an Undefined variable error which occurs when the
 SELECT NEW PATIENT action is executed from any of the PXCE ENCOUNTER
 options to select a different patient.  If the user presses the [ENTER]
 key at the 'Select PATIENT NAME:' prompt without selecting a patient or an
 attempt to select a new patient is given up, an error will occur when the
 next action is executed.
  
 After this patch is installed, if the user presses the [ENTER] key without
 entering a new patient name, a new message will be displayed, 'Patient
 has not been selected', and the user is taken back to the 'Select Action:'
 prompt.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
   Problem:
   --------
   An Undefined variable error occurs when the user presses the [ENTER]
   key at the 'Select PATIENT NAME:' prompt without selecting a patient.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine PXCEPAT has been modified to retain its reference to the
   previously selected patient if no new patient has been selected.
  
   Additionally, a new message, "Patient has not been selected", will be
   displayed to alert the user that the new selection has not been
   accomplished.
