Subject: CORRECT UNDEFINED DA VARIABLE ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The purpose of this patch is to clean up an undefined error found while
 testing FileMan V22. In previous versions of FileMan the DA variable was
 passed from DIC calls, and programs have been written to assume this
 variable will be defined. This is undocumented output and FileMan V22
 was updated to reset this variable before exiting.
  
 The error could be recreated when prompted to add a NEW 7131 from
 the Request for 7131 Information [DVBA 7131 INFORMATION REQUEST] option.
  
 Currently this does not create an error because FileMan V22 has an SACC
 exemption to continue to leave this variable defined.
  
 The routine DVBAREG2 has been modified to reset this variable before
 making the DIE call to edit a record.
  
 This was reported in NOIS ISF-0199-61046

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system/should be loaded
  during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users.  Installation
  will take less than 5 minutes.
  
  
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*25):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*25.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
           
          Request for 7131 Information     DVBA 7131 INFORMATION REQUEST
          
  7.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES??",
      respond NO.
        
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
