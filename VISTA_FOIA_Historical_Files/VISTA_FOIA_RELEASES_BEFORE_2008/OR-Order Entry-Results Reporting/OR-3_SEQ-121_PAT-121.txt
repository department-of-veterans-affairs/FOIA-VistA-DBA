Subject: SUMMARY REPORT & NATURE OF ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch resolves the following problems:
   
  PROBLEM #1: Order Summary Reports have been ignoring a field in the
  NATURE OF ORDER file (#100.02) called PRINT DAILY SUMMARY, which
  was designed to screen orders of certain types (determined by
  Nature of Order) from printing on Order Summary reports.  This
  patch corrects this problem so that orders that have been given
  a Nature of Order where the PRINT DAILY SUMMARY field is set to
  NO will no longer be included in the Order Summary Reports.
  
  NOTE: Please review the settings in the Nature of Order file
  for the PRINT DAILY SUMMARY field and notify users of the summary
  reports that after this patch is installed, they will no longer
  see orders that have a value of NO in this field.  For example,
  in my development account, I show the following:
  
  NAME                            PRINT DAILY SUMMARY
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  
  SERVICE CORRECTION              NO
