                         XU*8.0*342
  
 1) This patch fixes a problem that was reported in the NOIS 
    MWV-0304-22021. The problem was the 'Option Access By User' [XUOPTWHO]
    did not list all the users with a particular menu option. Users who had
    an empty verify code would not appear on the report.
  
 2) This patch fixes a problem that was reported in the
    NOIS ANN-0404-40508. The problem was a 'string too long' error 
    sometimes occurred after selecting the 'Option Access By User' 
    [XUOPTWHO]. This occurred after selecting options that had too many
    paths to be accessed.
  
 3) This patch fixes a problem that was reported in the NOIS 
    PUG-0304-50092. The problem was with the option Inquiry to a
    User's File Access [XUFILEINQUIRY] because it did not display
    the full number for the file-number field. This happened to files
    that had a file number that was ten characters.

    non-peak time. It will take about one minute to install the
    patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
  
 2. DSM/AXP sites - Review your mapped routines set. If the routines
    in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, disable mapping for
    the affected routines.
  
 3. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 4. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
    option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
 5. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
    You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
    menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Backup a Transport Global
  
    On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    option:
                 Install Package(s)  
                 Select INSTALL NAME:XU*8.0*342
                                     ==========
  
    Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
    Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//NO
  
 6. AXP Sites - Answer 'NO' to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to other
