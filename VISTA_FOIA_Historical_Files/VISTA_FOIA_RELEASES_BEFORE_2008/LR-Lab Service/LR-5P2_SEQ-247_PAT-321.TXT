 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. BHS-1204-10061
  
    Problem:  When new antibiotics are added to the list of resulted
 antibiotics in a panel, a new sub file is created for the additional
 antibiotics.  Code was added to routine LRMIBUG to correct the problem with
 interpretive results not being removed when a sensitivity result is deleted.
 This code orders down through the list of antibiotics, checks to see if the
 sensitivity data is present, and removes the interpretive data if there is no
 sensitivity data. The problem occurs when at the end of the list, the new sub
 file node in the global is encountered. The original code was not written in
 anticipation of this occurrence. The result is an undefined variable error.
    --------
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This problem was resolved by adding code that anticipates the presence of
    this additional node in the global and quits without an error.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.
   
 Installation will take less than 1 minute.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
      mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
       [XPD MAIN]: 
   
            Edits and Distribution ...  
            Utilities ...  
            Installation ...  
   
       Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
   
            1      Load a Distribution
            2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            3      Print Transport Global
            4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
            5      Backup a Transport Global
            6      Install Package(s)
                   Restart Install of Package(s)
                   Unload a Distribution
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*321):
   
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
           not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package LR*5.2*321.
   
       a.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
           YES//', respond NO.
       b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
           and Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
   6.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
