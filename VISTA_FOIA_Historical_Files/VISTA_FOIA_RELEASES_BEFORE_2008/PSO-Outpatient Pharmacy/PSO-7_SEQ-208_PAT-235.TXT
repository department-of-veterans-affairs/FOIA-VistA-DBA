Subject: ESCAPE CHARACTERS IN VDEF MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch adds the proper escape sequences to the Outpatient Pharmacy
 VDEF (Vista Data Extraction Framework) message that sends prescription
 information to the HDR (Health Data Repository). This will help avoid 
 errors that can occur when special delimiting characters are found in 
 Vista fields.
  
 This patch also makes modifications to the trigger events that send 
 prescription information to the HDR, using the VDEF. A problem was
 reported where the Clinical ID information was not being sent in some
 messages. This patch fixes that problem.
  
 A request has also been made to add two new trigger events, those being
 when the status of a prescription changes from Active to Suspended, and
 from Suspended to Active. This patch adds those trigger events.
  
 The name of the Institution has also been added to the message.
  
 **NOTE** You must suspend the VDEF Request Queue before installing this 
 patch and then re-enable it after installation of the patch.  There are 
 three emergency patches being released on the same day (PSO*7*235, 
 DG*5.3*698, and GMRA*4*34), that all require the suspension and the
 re-enabling of the VDEF Request Queue during patch installation. Please
 coordinate the patch installation activities of these three patches. Keep
 in mind that the suspension of the VDEF Request Queue will not prevent 
 any new requests in all VDEF Domain applications from being added to the
 VDEF Request Queue, it will only delay the building of these VDEF HL7
 messages until the VDEF Request Queue is enabled again. The steps for
 doing that are outlined in the installation instructions.
  
  
 IMPORTANT: 
 Prior to installing patch PSO*7.0*235, please check to see if you have the
 PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS job tasked to run on a 24 hour rescheduling 
 frequency. This is very important, as it relates to the HDR, because this 
 job sets the status of a prescription to Expired the day after the 
 prescription expiration date, and also updates the HDR with this 
 information. If this job is not running, prescriptions could show as 
 Active in the HDR, when the expiration date is in the past.
  
 The job in TaskMan would look something like this:
  
 2478948: PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS - Expire Prescriptions.  No device.
          CHYSQA,ROU.  From Today at 1:11,  By you.        Scheduled for 
 Today at 23:00
   
  
  
 Please check to see if this job is tasked to run on a 24 hour 
 rescheduling frequency. To access the set-up of this job in Outpatient

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
 from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation includes:
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PSO_7_P235_TM_CP.pdf             Technical Manual (change pages)
   PSO_7_TM_R0306.pdf               Technical Manual (updated)
  
  
 Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VistA Documentation
 Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
 http://www.va.gov/vdl 
  
  
 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
 Because this patch modifies routines involved in the exchange of messages
 between Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Outpatient Pharmacy,
 this patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy users
 on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not being
 acted upon through CPRS. There are also various tasked jobs that generate
 message exchanges between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy, and this patch
 should be installed at a time when these jobs are not running. These jobs
 include PSO AUTOCANCEL, PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS, and ORMTIME RUN, and 
 PRINT LABELS FROM SUSPENSE. There is also a one-time tasked job,
 PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE, that should not be running during installation. 
 Additionally, CMOP transmissions should not be taking place during 
 installation.
  
 Installation of this patch should take no longer than 3 minutes.
  
 1. Stop the VDEF Request Queue by following these steps: 
  
    Select OPTION NAME: VDEF CONFIGURATION MENU       VDEF Configuration 
    and Status
  
    Select VDEF Configuration and Status Option: SUS  Suspend/Run Request 
    Queue
  
    Select Request Queue: MAINTENANCE  
    SUSPENDED FLAG: RUNNING// S  SUSPENDED
  
    Select Request Queue: 
    
  
 2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 3. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 4. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 5. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*235) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*235.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 9. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 10. After the patch is installed, enable the VDEF Request Queue by    
     following these steps:
  
     Select OPTION NAME: VDEF CONFIGURATION MENU       VDEF Configuration 
     and Status
  
     Select VDEF Configuration and Status Option: SUS  Suspend/Run Request 
     Queue
  
     Select Request Queue: MAINTENANCE  
     SUSPENDED FLAG: SUSPENDED// RU  RUNNING
