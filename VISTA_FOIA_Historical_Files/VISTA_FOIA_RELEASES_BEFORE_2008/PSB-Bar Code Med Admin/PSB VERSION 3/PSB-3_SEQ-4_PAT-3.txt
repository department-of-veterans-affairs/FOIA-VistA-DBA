Subject: UNDO PATCH REMOVE AND GUI MED LOG EDIT

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
      executable file. Installation of this new GUI is REQUIRED in order
      for the patch to function.  The new GUI MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY 
      after the KIDS install in order for the software to function. ***    
  
  Note:  This patch implements the GUI version of the [PSB MED LOG EDIT]
  option.  The Character User Interface (CHUI) [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option 
  will be removed from the system when PSB*3.0*3 has been installed.
  
  
  
  For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
  Installation Instructions section.
  
  
  1.  Problem: NOIS BUT-1203-21780
      Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) users are not able to re-
      instate a medication patch if it had been unintentionally marked as 
      "REMOVED" via BCMA. This issue has been delegated a "PATIENT SAFETY" 
      keyword.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The removal of a medication patch may be undone if it had been
      unintentionally marked as "REMOVED"; this may be accomplished by the
      user who marked the medication patch as 'REMOVED' or by a user
      allocated the "PSB MANAGER" key.
  
  
  2.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0204-30176
      The prompt "Enter the DATE of Administration: Today//" of the Manual 
      Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option has caused confusion.
      The user unintentionally accepts the default (i.e. "Today") when 
      attempting to document a past administration.     
  
      Corrective Action:
      The prompt "Enter the DATE of Administration: Today //" will be
      replaced by the prompt "Enter the DATE the medication was 
      administered: //" when using the Manual Medication Entry 
      [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.  Also, this new prompt will not accept
      the entry of a future date/time for an administration.
  
  
  3.  Problem: NOIS PHO-0904-61033
      The BCMA Medication History report does not show large volume IV
      medications data when viewed via the Computerized Patient Record System
      (CPRS) GUI "Orders/View/Details..." option.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The BCMA Medication History report will display large volume IV 
      medications data when viewed via the CPRS GUI.
  
  
  4.  Problem: NOIS LAH-0404-61280
      The user is unable to access a patient's VDL when receiving an error
      message containing the text "GETPRNS+17^PSBPRN".  These messages occur
      when a patient is no longer admitted when that patient's VDL is
      refreshed.
  
      Corrective Action:
      BCMA will continue, without error, when a patient is no longer admitted
      while that patient's VDL is being viewed and refreshed.
  
  
  5.  Problem: NOIS MWV-0704-20690
      The user is able to change the status of an order's patch medication
      while that order concurrently has another "GIVEN" and not "REMOVED"
      patch medication.  After the initial status of a patch of that order has 
      been set to a status other than "GIVEN", that patch can then be
      administered via BCMA, without a warning to the user concerning a
      concurrently "GIVEN" patch.
  
      Corrective Action:      
      BCMA will not allow multiple patches of a patch medication order to be
      at the status of "GIVEN" concurrently.
  
  
  6.  Problem: NOIS SFC-0704-60956
      The user is unable to edit a "NOT GIVEN" administration using the "Edit 
      Medication Log" [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option.
     
      Corrective Action:
      The user will be able to edit "NOT GIVEN" administrations using the GUI
      version of the "Edit Med Log" found under the "File" menu of the BCMA
      VDL.
       
  
  7.  Problem: NOIS CLL-0704-40997
      If an IV piggyback bag is marked as "GIVEN", the VDL is not refreshed,
      and the VDL "start/stop time" parameters are reset making that specific
      administration no longer display on the VDL, then that "GIVEN" bag can
      be scanned and administered again.
  
      Corrective Action:
      BCMA will not allow an IV piggyback bag to be scanned and "GIVEN" multiple
      times.
  
  
  8.  Enhancement:  Include Comments on the Medication History Report.
      PSB*3.0*3 will provide the user the ability to include comments that
      were documented during an administration to appear on the Medication
      History Report. This new functionality is accessible via the BCMA GUI
      and CPRS GUI.
  
  9.  Enhancement:  Report Medication History in reverse chronological order.
      PSB*3.0*3 will display the Medication History Report in reverse
      chronological order; chronologically latter order activities will display
      before earlier order activities.
