Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  Below is a list of all the applications
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*260
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*363
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*5
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*127
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*63
  
 The first three patches (BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260) will be
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  Patches PSX*2*63 and
 PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an
 implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution and the
 stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed prior to
 the installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).
 After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the
 site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy
 product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not
 to activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
  
 The software changes distributed by this patch are exclusively for
 supporting the ECME application for the ePharmacy/ECME Enhancements
 project (BPS*1*5). There is no functional impact to the CMOP application.
 The change is technical in nature and is explained below:
  
   The PSXBPSRP routine was created to replace the BPSCEAR routine, which
   was previously used by ECME to run the CMOP/ECME Activity Report [BPS RPT
   CMOP/ECME ACTIVITY] option. This option will be changed to call the 
   PSXBPSRP routine instead. This call is supported by the Database
   Integration Agreement #4968.

  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.
