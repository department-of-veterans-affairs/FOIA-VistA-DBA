The HEPC-GUI-SRC.ZIP file contains the source code of the GUI.
The ORCtrlLib50.zip file contains custom CPRS components required to build the GUI, 
just in case (probably, these controls are already available somewhere else).

The steps to build the GUI executable:

Install the VistA RPC Broker and CPRS components into the Delphi environment
Unzip the GUI source code (preserving the structure of the directories)
Open the HepatitisCRegistry.dpr project
Review the parameters (especially, the directories)
Build the GUI
