Description:
============

  
 ****************************** ATTENTION *******************************
 An issue was introduced with patch PSO*7*260 that removed the display
 of Dosage, Verb, Dispense Unit, Noun, Route, and Schedule from the
 VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option.  This functionality is restored in
 PSO*7*264 Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch. 
  
 It is suggested that the Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch PSO*7*264 be 
 installed immediately after the ePharmacy/ECME Enhancements bundle of 
 patches in order to restore full functionality of the option.
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  Below is a list of all the applications
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*260
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*363
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*5
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*127
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*63
  
 The first three patches (BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260) will be
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  Patches PSX*2*63 and
 PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an
 implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution and the
 stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed prior to
 the installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).
 After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the
 site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy
 product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not
 to activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application as described 
 below: 
  
 ****************************** N O T E **********************************
   PSO*7*260 contains routines that may overwrite Class III modifications
   for some Outpatient Automation. Class III changes must be reinstated 
   after installing PSO*7*260.
  
   
 1. LAST LOCAL NDC Update 
        
    Currently, the LAST LOCAL NDC (#1) field in the NDC BY OUTPATIENT SITE 
    (#50.037) sub-file in the DRUG (#50) file is updated only during the 
    release process, manual or automatic (OPAI). The update only occurs if 
    these two conditions are satisfied: 1) the NDC picked at release (or 
    received through OPAI) is different than the original NDC sent to the 
    payer during Rx Finish or Suspense Label Print; 2) the new submission
    for the released NDC returns a PAYABLE claim.  
  
    Although the functionality and logic above will be preserved, the LAST 
    LOCAL NDC information will also be updated during the initial claim 
    submission for the specific prescription fill. The initial submission 
    for local filled prescriptions (non-CMOP) occurs either during the 
    prescription finish/refill request or during the Local Label Print 
    process (Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option). The only 
    condition for updating the LAST LOCAL NDC in this situation will be 
    the return of a PAYABLE claim.  
  
 2. Ignored Rejects Report [PSO IGNORED REJECTS REPORT] 
  
    A new report is included on the ePharmacy menu option [PSO EPHARMACY 
    MENU] and it is called Ignored Rejects Report [PSO IGNORED REJECTS 
    REPORT]. It lists prescription fills for a given division and date 
    range that were ignored after the 3rd Party Payer rejected the claim.  
    The user may sort by patient, drug, and/or user who marked the fills 
    as ignored.  During sort selection, the user may select specific 
    patients, drugs and/or users.  
  
 3. Prescription Activity Log 
  
    3.1 NDC and DAW CODE edits 
  
        When the user edits the NDC or DAW CODE fields within a 
        prescription, the editing event is not being logged on the main
        prescription activity log section as it is for other fields in the
        prescription. Edits to these two fields will now be logged as
        indicated in the example below:
  
    Activity Log:                                                      
    #   Date        Reason         Rx Ref         Initiator Of Activity 
    ====================================================================
    1   09/01/06    EDIT           ORIGINAL       OPUSER,ONE 
    Comments: NDC changed from 99999-9999-99 to 55555-4444-22           
    2   09/01/06    EDIT           ORIGINAL       OPUSER,TWO 
    Comments: DAW CODE changed from 0 to 5 
  
    3.2 ECME reversed/NOT re-submitted 
   
        A new entry in the activity log will indicate that ECME performed a
        reversal but not a resubmission because for some reason the
        prescription fill is no longer billable (e.g. Patient is no longer
        insured) as seen below:
  
    Activity Log:                                                      
    #   Date        Reason         Rx Ref         Initiator Of Activity 
    ====================================================================
    1   09/01/06    EDIT           ORIGINAL       OPUSER,ONE 
    Comments: ECME reversed/NOT re-submitted: NOT INSURED.  
  
 4. View Prescription [PSO VIEW] 
  
    4.1 Display NDC 
  
        For ePharmacy released prescriptions only, the system will now 
        display the NDC used to dispense the medication for the original 
        prescription and for each refill. The example below shows the NDC 
        used for the original: 
  
                  ...                     
                      Rx #: 71599999$e                   
            Orderable Item: HYDROCODONE/ACETAMINOPHEN TAB 
                 CMOP Drug: HYDROCODONE 5/ACETAMINOPHEN 500MG TAB 
                       NDC: 55555-4444-22 
                      Verb: TAKE     
                   *Dosage: 1 TABLET                             
                  ...                     
   
    4.2 Display ECME# 
  
        The ECME# will be displayed at the right side of the Rx# between 
        parenthesis as shown below: 
                  ...                     
                      Rx #: 71599999$e   (ECME#: 1234567) 
            Orderable Item: HYDROCODONE/ACETAMINOPHEN TAB 
                 CMOP Drug: HYDROCODONE 5/ACETAMINOPHEN 500MG TAB 
                       NDC: 55555-4444-22 
                      Verb: TAKE    
                   *Dosage: 1 TABLET 
                  ...                     
  
    4.3 Lookup by ECME# 
  
        The user will be able to identify the prescription by the ECME# 
        by using the following syntax: 
   
        VIEW PRESCRIPTION: ? 
  
         You may enter E.NNNNNNN, where NNNNNN is the 
         prescription ECME# (e.g., E.0289332) or, 
         Answer with PRESCRIPTION RX # 
         Do you want the entire PRESCRIPTION List? N 
  
        VIEW PRESCRIPTION: E.1234567 
  
 5. Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] 
  
    Date range prompts will be added to this REJECT VIEW/PROCESS menu 
    option to allow the users to see the rejects for a specific period 
    of time. This enhancement is expected to reduce the response time 
    for loading the rejects into the reject list depending on the date 
    range selected. The date range selected will be displayed on the 
    header of the reject list.  
  
 6. Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] 
  
    6.1 Group by Insurance 
  
        A new option GI (Group by Insurance) is being added to allow 
        users to group the rejects in the Reject Worklist by their 
        insurance companies. If the list is grouped by Insurance, the 
        GI option has the opposite effect, it removes the grouping. 
        This option is also available for the Third Party Payer 
        Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] option.  
  
    6.2 Add Comments (hidden action) 
  
        A new hidden action called 'COM Add Comments' is being added 
        to the Reject Worklist to provide users a method to update the 
        status during the processing of rejections. This action is also 
        available for the Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO 
        REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] option.  
   
    6.3 Enable OVR (Submit Override Codes) for RTS rejects 
  
        Currently, the hidden action OVR Override DUR Reject can only
        be selected for DUR (#88) rejects on the worklist. After this
        patch is installed, this action will be renamed to Submit 
        Override Codes and the users will also be able to invoke it for 
        Refill Too Soon (#79) rejects on the worklist. 
   
    6.4 Submit Clarif. Code (hidden action) 
   
        A new hidden action called 'CLA  Submit Clarif. Code' is being 
        added to the Reject Worklist to allow users to enter appropriate 
        Submission Clarification Code with claims resubmission for 
        rejects. Once a Clarification Code is sent along with the claim, 
        the reject is marked resolved. The second screen shows the 
        changes to the Resolution Information. Furthermore, an entry is 
        logged under the prescription ECME Log, as shown below: 
     
    ECME Log:

    Comments: Submitted to ECME: REJECT WORKLIST(CLARIF. CODE=2) 
    ...
   
   6.5 Prior Authorization Submission (hidden action) 
  
        A new hidden action called 'PA Submit Prior Auth.' is being 
        added to the Reject Worklist to allow users to send Prior 
        Authorization information with claims resubmission for rejects.  
        Once the Prior Authorization is sent along with the claim, the 
        reject is marked resolved. Furthermore, an entry is logged under 
        the prescription ECME Log, as shown below: 
  
    ECME Log:

    ...
   
 7. ePharmacy Medication Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] 
  
    This new menu option will provide users with a 'View Only' version of 
    the current Medication Profile screen seen in the Patient Prescription 
    Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. This option will not allow any 
    actions such as Refill, Renewal, Hold, etc., therefore the term 'View 
    Only'. Another main difference is that it will display duplicate drugs 
    for the patient. The main purpose of this option is to provide the 
    Outpatient Pharmacy user with a tool to research 3rd party payer 
    rejects due to Refill Too Soon or Drug Utilization Review (DUR) 
    reasons.  
  
    Important: Several settings that determine the display of the data in 
               this new option can be configured by Pharmacy Division and 
               also by user. If no configuration is created for a specific 
               Pharmacy Division or user, the system utilizes the 'factory 
               default' which is a pre-configured set of preferences. For 
               more information on how to creating Pharmacy Division or 
               user specific settings read the section below about the new 
               ePharmacy Medication Profile Division Preferences [PSO PMP 
               SITE PREFERENCES] 
    
    7.1 Reject Worklist/View Process (new action) 
    
        The new option above will be accessible in the existing Third 
        Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and Third 
        Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] 
        options through the new action MP (Medication Profile).  
  
 8. ePharmacy Medication Profile Division Preferences [PSO PMP SITE 
    PREFERENCES] 
  
    The sole purpose of this option is to support the ePharmacy Medication 
    Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] option mentioned above by providing the 
    users a way to determine how the data should be displayed. Below is a 
    list of settings that can be configured specifically for each Pharmacy 
    Division: 
  
     EXP/CANCEL CUTOFF - Indicates the maximum number of days for an 
                         expired and/or discontinued prescription to be cut 
                         from the ePharmacy Medication Profile.  
  
     SORT BY - Indicates which field the list should be sorted by. The user 
               can choose from following: Rx#, DRUG NAME, ISSUE DATE or 
               LAST FILL DATE.  
  
     SORT ORDER - Indicates the sorting order in which the field selected 
                  above should be sorted: ASCENDING or DESCENDING.  
    
     DISPLAY SIG - Indicates whether the SIG should be displayed under each 
                   medication order on the list. 
    
     GROUP BY STATUS - Indicates whether the list of medication orders 
                       should be broken up by status (ACTIVE, HOLD, etc.).
  
     DISPLAY ORDER COUNT - Indicates whether the number of medication 
                           orders under each group should be displayed in 
                           front of the group name (e.g., PENDING ORDERS 
                           (4 orders)).  
  
 9. NCPDP vs. NPI 
  
    With the transition from NCPDP to NPI number the Reject Information 
    screen in the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS 
    WORKLIST] and Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS 
    VIEW/PROCESS] options will be slightly modified to display the correct 
    information for each reject. The label 'NCPDP#' below will be made 
    dynamic. Depending on which information was used for the prescription 
    (NCPDP or NPI), the label will display either 'NCPDP#:' or 'NPI#:' 
    accordingly.  
  
   Reject Information(RESOLVED)  Sep 14, 2006@19:22  Page:    1 of 1 
   Division : CHEYENNE VAM&ROC                     NCPDP#: 4454812

 10. NPI INSTITUTION (#101) field in the OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file 
  
     Due to some confusion generated after the release of patch 
     PSO*7*254, which introduced the field above, the description for 
     this field is being changed to the following: 
  
       The value in the field should point to the entry in the 
       INSTITUTION file (#4) that contains the NPI number for the 
       dispensing pharmacy for this Outpatient Pharmacy division.  
  
 11. New fields: CLARIFICATION CODE (#24), PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TYPE 
                 (#25) and PRIOR AUTHORIZATION NUMBER (#26) 
  
     The fields above are being added to the REJECT INFO sub-file 
     (#52.25) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to support the changes 
     introduced by this patch for the submission of the Clarification 
     Code and Prior Authorization information to the third party 
     payer.  
  
 12. New sub-file: COMMENTS (#52.8551) 
   
     The sub-file above is being added under the REJECT INFO sub-file 
     (#52.25) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to support the changes 
     introduced by this patch to allow Outpatient Pharmacy users to 
     enter comments on third party payer rejects that they are working 
     on. Below is a list of the fields in this sub-file: 
  
        51   COMMENTS (multiple) 
             .01    DATE/TIME 
               1    USER 
               2    COMMENTS 
  
 13. New file: EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE PREFERENCES (#52.85) 
  
     The file above is being created to store the division and user 
     preferences for the new ePharmacy Medication Profile [PSO PMP] 
     option introduced by this patch. Below is a list of the fields 
     in this file: 
     
         .01  DIVISION 
           1  EXP/CANCEL CUTOFF

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
  
 Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Patches BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260 have post-installs that will run.
 Please see the post-installation instructions for the details of each of
 these post-installs.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
 BEFORE PROCEEDING, please read item number 8e and make sure you have the
 information needed in order to complete this installation.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed when users are not
 on the system and during non-peak hours.  Of particular concern would be
 the items below.
  
     1.  Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
         by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
         BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
         installation before this job starts.
     2.  Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being 
         transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish 
         or complete the installation before the transmission starts.  
         Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy Automated Data
         Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find out when
         CMOP transmissions occur.
     3.  In addition, note that you will be prompted to disable the
         following options during the installation:
           ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
           Patient Insurance Info View/Edit option [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
           Third Party Joint Inquiry option [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
  
 Install Time - Approximately 15 minutes
  
  
 ************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 Since the EPHARM IN HL logical link will be deleted by the BPS*1.0*5
 patch, please stop this logical link prior to installing the multi-build
 distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  This can be done via the Start/Stop
 Links [HL START] option.

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 There is a bug in the KIDs installation process for multi-builds.  Even
 though you may have requested that the menu rebuild occur for patches
 BPS*1*5 and PSO*7*260 while answering the installation questions, it is 
 possible that the menu rebuild did not occur.  If the rebuild did not
 occur and your system does not do an automatic menu rebuild in a nightly
 TaskMan process, you should do a manual rebuild via the Build Primary Menu
 Trees option [XQBUILDTREE] found in the Menu Rebuild Menu [XQBUILDMAIN]
 option.
  
 The BPS post-install routine delivered with BPS*1*5 will do the tasks
 listed below.  This post-install will be tasked and may take several
 hours to run.  When it is complete, it will send an email to the installer
 and the users in the BPS OPECC mail group.  The post-install routines
 BPS01P5* are being left on the system after the install.  They will be
 deleted with a future patch.
    1.  Delete the files listed in the 'The following is a list of files
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    2.  Delete the fields listed in the 'The following is a list of fields
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    3.  Delete obsolete records from the BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91)
        file.  These records are for National Council for Prescription Drug
        Programs (NCPDP) version 3x, which make these records obsolete.
    4.  Populate the new BPS STATISTICS file (#9002313.58) categories
        (Accepted Reversals, Rejected Reversals, and Dropped to Paper).
    5.  Populate the new SUBMIT DATE/TIME (#6) field of the BPS
        TRANSACTIONS file (#9002313.59).
    6.  Convert the ECME log data from global ^BPSECP("LOG") to the new
        BPS LOG file (#9002313.12).
    7.  Convert the submit processing queue from global ^BPSECP("BPSOSRX")
        to the temporary global ^XTMP("BPS-PROC").
  
 The IB post-install routine delivered with IB*2*363 will populate the
 E-PHARMACY DIVISION field (#.09) of the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14).
 This is a new field delivered with this patch.  The time required to
 accomplish this task may vary from site to site and is dependent upon how
 many electronic pharmacy claims are processed daily at the site.  The post
 install routine IB20P363 is being left on the system after the install.  
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
  
 The PSO post-install routine delivered with PSO*7*260 will set the
 REJECT INFO sub-file (#52.25) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) as READ
 ONLY.  This will prevent users from entering rejects through FileMan,
 which causes problems to the Outpatient Pharmacy application.  The post
 install routine PSO260PI is being left on the system after the install.
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
