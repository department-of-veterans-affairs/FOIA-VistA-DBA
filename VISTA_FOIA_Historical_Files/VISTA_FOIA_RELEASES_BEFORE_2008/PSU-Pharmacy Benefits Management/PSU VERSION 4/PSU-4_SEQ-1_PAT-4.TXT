 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.

         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will        
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
