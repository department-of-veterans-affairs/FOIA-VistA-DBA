Description:
============

 KNOWN ISSUES:
 =============
  
 Listed below are eight Known Issues identified with the release of 
 OR*3*195. Per Executive Directive Memorandum "Software Release with Known
 Defect Reporting" the following information regarding each Known Issue is
 provided below: the defect/issue, risks/impacts, and workarounds
 (alternative methods to do the job).
  
 The justification for release with these eight defects/issues is as 
 follows: The release of CPRS will support many interdependent projects,
 these include but are not limited to Inpatient Meds for Outpatients, Non
 Standard Schedules, Clinical Indicators/Data Capture as well as resolving 
 many patient safety issues some of which are over a year old and are 
 related to the Allergy Adverse Reaction enhancements contained in this 
 release.  There are also over 100 NOIS calls resolved by this release.  
 Additional delays in releasing CPRS v25 will put the release of CPRS v26 
 in jeopardy.  Most of the defects are minor inconveniences and the high 
 level ones identified by the test sites are listed in the release notes 
 and patch description message.  HSD&D has received concurrence from
 Cynthia Kindred, ADD for Health Data Systems and Martha Gerard, QA manager
 for Health Data Systems.
  
 Issue 1: Any CPRS User Can Mark an Allergy as "Entered In Error" or Add a
 New Allergy
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: When patches OR*3*195, GMRA*4.0*21, and 
 OR*3*216 have been installed, users will be able to add a new allergy as 
 well as marking an existing allergy as "entered in error" directly from
 the Cover Sheet. CPRS GUI v25 does not restrict which users can perform
 these actions.  
  
 Workarounds: None
  
 Resolution: This issue is scheduled to be resolved in CPRS GUI v.26 
 (OR*3*215).  A parameter will be added that will control who can use the
 "entered in error" option from the Cover Sheet and the Orders tab (to be
 consistent).  The ability to add a new allergy or to mark the patient as
 NKA will not be restricted.
  
 Issue 2: "Duration or Total Volume" Overrides IV Room Site Parameter
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: PSI-03-060 "IV Fluid Dialog" has been 
 addressed in CPRS GUI v25 by adding a new field "Duration or Total Volume"
 to the IV dialog per the CPRS Clinical Workgroup recommendation. By using
 this field, a provider can specify duration (length) or total volume for
 the IV order. This new field when utilized as a duration, however, will
 override the IV Room site parameter LVP'S GOOD FOR HOW MANY DAYS.
  
 Workarounds: 
 - When pharmacists are finishing the order, if they see an IV order 
   written with a duration, closely review to make sure it's appropriate.
 - Advise provider to not use the duration field unless they want to 
   override the IV policies.
  
 Resolution: PSJ*5*113 partially addresses this issue in that the stop date
 calculation for IV orders will be modified to treat  "Duration or Total
 Volume" the same as all other stop date parameters that exist  (it will no
 longer override the default). CPRS Clinical Workgroup input is still
 necessary to discuss the issue of there being no limit to the new field.
   
 Issue 3: Prohibition against Ordering Inpatient Medications for an
 Inpatient from an Outpatient Location
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: With CPRS v.25, some concerns about ordering
 inpatient medications from outpatient locations have come up. One possible
 scenario was as follows:
   
 It is not unusual that a very sick patient would be quickly admitted to an
 ICU bed without the patient's encounter, note, or all admission orders
 being completed.  Thus, the situation described below could happen again.
   
    1. Patient is checked in to the outpatient Urgent Care clinic.
    2. Patient is admitted to an inpatient ward/unit.
    3. While the patient has an inpatient status, the provider opens the
       patient's chart to complete the UCC Encounter. In doing so, he used 
       the "File ---> Update Provider/Location" option to change the 
       location back to the "Urgent Care".
    4. When finished with the encounter, the provider (leaving the 
       patient's location as "Urgent Care") proceeded with entering other
       orders (including inpatient meds) intended for the inpatient
       unit/ward. The system allowed the provider to sign those orders. The
       orders displayed in the appropriate display group in CPRS.
    5. However, the inpatient med orders (both unit dose and IV orders) did
       not appear in BCMA.
   
 As a result, the CPRS Clinical Workgroup endorsed the decision to prohibit
 ordering of inpatient medications for inpatient from outpatient locations
 because of possible patient safety issues.  
  
 Workarounds: None
  
 Resolution: The short-term resolution to this issue has been implemented 
 in CPRS GUI v.25 and is as follows:  If the user attempts to order 
 inpatient medications for an inpatient from an outpatient location, CPRS
 should discontinue the order process and return the user to original
 Orders or Meds tab display.  
  
 The long-term resolution to this issue includes both Pharmacy and CPRS 
 changes. The CPRS component is scheduled for CPRS GUI v.26 (OR*3*215).
 PSJ*5*112 and PSS*1*86 are the Pharmacy components necessary to allow 
 sites more freedom with the IMO clinics.  Changes include: 
 - Auto-dc of IMO orders on admission and discharge will be on a clinic
   basis. 
 - Seeing the orders in BCMA will also be done on a clinic basis.
  
 Issue 4:  Remote Data Views Retrieval of Discharge Summary from Sites with
 Different Versions of CPRS Can Cause Missing Text
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: The Code Text Descriptor project determined 
 that ICD codes and associated diagnosis information should not display in 
 the detailed information of the Discharge Summary report format.
 Developers made this change, which made the v.25 report different from the
 v.24 report. Because the reports are different, if users at a site running
 one version of CPRS request a Clinical Reports Discharge Summary from a
 site running a different version of CPRS through Remote Data Views, the
 report may be missing some text or may not display correctly as described
 below:
   
 - When a v.24 site user requests a discharge summary from a v.25 site, the
   [+] column will not indicate that there is detailed information
   available. The other main columns will be correct as the majority of the
   columns were undisturbed. When the user clicks on an entry, the details
   will display in the lower pane. The top-most information related to who
   entered it and when will be correct. Also, the detail pane will display
   "DIAGNOSIS:" but there will not be any data.
   
 - When a v.25 site user requests a discharge summary from a v.24 site,
   CPRS displays the following informational box and the request will not 
   be completed: "Programmer message: One or more column ID s in file
   101.24 do not match ID s coded in extract routine .
   
 Workarounds: None
  
 Resolution: This discrepancy between reports occurs only when the sites 
 involved are running different versions of CPRS: v.25 and a previous
 version of CPRS. If both sites are running the same version of CPRS, the
 problem does not occur. When all sites have installed CPRS GUI v.25, the
 report formats will match and this will no longer be an issue.
   
 Issue 5:  CIDC-related Record Locking Causes Undefined Error
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: This error has only been reported by two of 
 the four test sites that have installed both CPRS GUI v.25 (OR*3*195) and
 CIDC and have enabled CIDC. When users are placing orders, very
 infrequently an invalid order IEN is stored in the second node of ^OR(100,
 resulting in orders being locked on the users at the ancillary level and
 an undefined error occurring in routine ORWDXR.
     
 Workarounds:  To address this problem, CPRS developers created a fix for 
 sites with CIDC currently in their accounts that prevents these invalid
 IENs from being stored in their ORDERS file, ^OR(100). Enterprise VistA
 Support (EVS) has the fix and can assist sites that are experiencing this
 problem.
  
 Resolution: The same fix identified as a workaround will be in patch 
 OR*3*229.  This prevents the order locking problem. Site testing for
 OR*3*229 is expected to begin on January 27, 2005, with a release to
 follow shortly after OR*3*195.  CPRS GUI v.26 will also include an
 additional Delphi fix which prevents the sending of an invalid IEN.
   
 Issue 6: Known issue with Allergy Order Dialog launch from Reminder 
 Dialog
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: With the new Allergy functionality, 
 allergies are no longer entered as orders but are entered directly into 
 the Allergy package. To make these changes, developers created a new
 dialog that is installed with the new Allergy functionality (using patches
 OR*3.0*195, GMRA*4.0*21, and OR*3.0*216). After these patches are
 installed, any Reminder dialog that contains GMRAOR ALLERGY ENTER/EDIT as
 a finding item will NOT bring up the allergy dialog when the user clicks
 the Finish button. 
  
 Workarounds: San Diego, one of the test sites for OR*3*195, discovered 
 this problem and offered the following workaround:  Instead of embedding
 the allergy dialog directly into the Clinical  Reminder, San Diego placed
 it on an order menu and then embedded the order menu into the reminder.
 The result is one extra click for the user, but the dialog then works as
 it should.
   
 Resolution: This issue is scheduled to be resolved in CPRS GUI v.26 
 (OR*3*215).   
  
 Issue 7: Free-Text Entry Could Cause Incorrect Dosage
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: This problem could occur when a user is 
 writing medication orders: simple and complex inpatient orders, simple and
 complex outpatient orders, or non-VA medications. When a dosage was
 already entered by the user or by a quick order and the user clicks in the
 field to edit the dosage rather than selecting a different dosage from the
 available list, the highlighted dosage is replaced by the first character
 of the new dosage, but then the cursor incorrectly moves back to the left
 and types over that character when the user types additional numbers. For
 example, if a quick order contained a dosage of 75MG and the user
 attempted to change to 25MG, the user would highlight the dosage if
 necessary, type the 2, which would appear, but the cursor would then
 incorrectly move back to the far left and replace the 2 with a 5 when the
 user typed the 5. This would create a dosage of 5MG instead of the
 intended 25MG. The cursor movement occurs with the first character only.
 Note: This issue has been elevated to a patient safety issue and will be
 tracked as PSI-05-004.
   
 Workarounds: To mitigate this problem in the interim, if users choose to 
 edit the dosage, they should choose from the list of available dosages.
   
 Other suggestions to avoid this problem include:
   
 - Sites can help their providers by creating quick orders with common
   dosages so that providers can choose an appropriate quick order and will
   not have to edit the dosage manually.
 - Sites can try to ensure that sufficient dosages are available in the
   drop-down list so that providers can select the dosage rather than 
   manually editing it.
 - Instruct providers to use <delete> key on keyboard rather than 
   <backspace> key to clear the dosage field. Cursor placement problem 
   doesn't occur when the <delete> key is used. Thus, manual entry of the 
   order will not be affected by incorrect cursor position.
   
 Resolution: This problem is scheduled to be resolved in CPRS GUI v.26 
 (OR*3*215).
  
 Issue 8: Typing Consult Service Name Can Prevent entry of Prerequisites 
 and Templated Reason for Request
  
 Defect/Issue - Risks/Impacts: When ordering a consult, if a user types the
 service name followed by the Tab key or clicks in any other field, the
 user will bypass the fields for Prerequisites and templated Reason for
 Request. This may result in submitted consults with missing, incomplete or
 erroneous information in those fields.
   
 Workarounds: Instruct users to select the service name from the displayed
 list or type the service name followed by the Enter key. These actions
 will insure that the Prerequisites and templated Reason for Request fields
 display for entry.
   
 Resolution: TBD
  
  
 ADDITIONAL ISSUES:
  
 During the testing of CPRS GUI v.25, internal Software Quality Assurance 
 (SQA) and the test sites discovered additional issues that were not 
 resolved in OR*3.0*195. A document listing these issues is available upon 
 patch release on the CPRS page: http://vista.med.va.gov/cprs/
  
  
 PATCH DESCRIPTION
 =================
  
 Patch OR*3*195, version 25 of the GUI implements the following main
 functionalities in addition to the enhancements and fixes listed 
 subsequently:
  
     - Clinical Indicators Data Capture (CIDC)/Billing Awareness
     - Allergy/Adverse Reaction Tracking (with OR*3*216 & GMRA*4*21)
     - Non-Standard Schedules for Meds
     - A "Clinic Medications" Display Group
     - Separate Cover Sheet and PCE Date Range Parameters 
  
  
 -- CIDC (CLINICAL INDICATORS DATA CAPTURE (CIDC)/BILLING AWARENESS)
  
 Note: Sites should not implement these features until they receive 
       guidance from the VHA Chief Business Office (CBO). If you have any 
       questions, please contact Dan Speece, CBO Implementation Manager 
       for CIDC, at (202) 254-0137.
  
 - This release includes additional CIDC functionality that requires the
 user to enter Billing Data for those orders deemed as "Billable".  Billing
 Data that will be captured mainly consists of Diagnoses and Treatment
 Factors (SC,AO,IR,HNC, etc.).  Those orders which are deemed "billable"
 will require the entry of one (min) to four (max) diagnoses and all
 associated Treatment Factors prior to signing the order(s).  Currently the
 Chief Business Office has determined that entry of billing data will be
 limited to those users with the "Provider" key.  CIDC functionality will 
 remain dormant until the ancillary portion of CIDC is installed.  There is
 a CIDC Provider parameter created that allows the sites to roll out CIDC
 per Provider.
  
 - New functionality has been developed that will allow the users to set 
 up their Personal Diagnosis Lists based on their specialty and/or most 
 common diagnoses.
  
 - When a Provider selects a Diagnosis from the Problem List, those 
 Treatment Factors associated with the problem will be used to populate the
 Treatment Factors entry when signing orders.
  
 -- ALLERGY/ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING
  
 The ART functionality described below will become active when ART patch
 GMRA*4.0*21 and OR patch OR*3*216 have been installed.  In the absence of
 these patches, existing functionality will continue as in v24.
  
 - In this version, allergies and adverse reactions are no longer entered
 as orders in the ORDER file.  A modified order dialog entry for GMRAOR
 ALLERGY will be exported in a separate OR patch (Patch OR*3*216), and
 though allergies will no longer be entered as orders, this item can still
 appear on order menus as in the past.  New entries are added directly
 through interaction with the ART package and directly into that package's
 files.  They will no longer appear as orders on the Orders tab but will
 continue to appear in the allergies box on the cover sheet as well as be
 viewable from the CWAD button on any tab.
  
 - Existing allergies can now be marked as "entered in error", directly 
 from the Cover Sheet.  Clicking on an allergy will produce a detailed 
 display window as it always has, but this window will now include 
 additional buttons for the new "Add New" and "Entered in Error" 
 functions.  These same functions can be accessed via a right-click menu 
 on the Cover Sheet allergies list.
  
 - Causative agents of type "OTHER ALLERGY/ADVERSE REACTION" and 
 signs/symptoms of type "OTHER REACTION" will no longer be selectable.  
 The ART package has also been changed to eliminate these items as 
 choices, in the continuing effort to end free-text and unspecific entries.
  
 - When receiving the warning message about entry of a free text causative 
 agent, the default button has now been set to "NO" rather than "YES".  
 Additionally, exiting either this screen (or the "free-text comment" 
 entry screen that follows after clicking "YES") using the system "X" 
 button to close the window will cancel the action rather than continuing.
  
 - Added "?" button next to "Severity" combo box which provides 
 definitions of severity levels when clicked.
  
 - The "Marked On Chart" checkbox has been removed from the allergy entry 
 screen.  By virtue of entering an allergy or adverse reaction in CPRS, 
 the user is by definition marking the electronic chart.  That information 
 will now be recorded automatically without requiring the user to manually
 check the box.
  
 As in previous CPRS GUI versions, a Progress Note is generated when a new 
 observed allergy or adverse reaction is entered or an allergy is marked
 entered in error.  Once the note is signed by the user entering/marking in
 error or by an administrative update user, the note is viewable by all
 users.
  
 -- NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES
  
 - When placing an inpatient medication order, a free text schedule is no 
 longer allowed.  Instead, users must select a valid schedule from schedule
 list box or click "OTHER" to create a valid customized, day-week
 administrative time schedule. Only inpatient orders with valid schedules 
 can be used in copy, transfer, and renew operations.
  
 -- "CLINIC MEDICATIONS" DISPLAY GROUP
   
 - A new "CLINIC MEDICATIONS" display group in IMO (Inpatient Medication 
 orders for Outpatients) has been created for grouping IMO orders. On the 
 Orders tab, IMO orders will be displayed under the "Clin. Meds" group.  
 Users can select Custom Views -> Pharmacy -> "Clinic medications" to view
 all IMO orders.  On the Meds tab, IMO orders are displayed at the top of 
 Inpatient Medication Orders panel, with ordering location information in 
 the last column.  Transfer actions are not allowed for IMO orders.
  
 For CPRS to display the Clinic Medications display group on the Orders tab
 (the display group that shows Inpatient Medications for Outpatients), 
 sites will need to make an entry in the ORWOR CATEGORY SEQUENCE parameter
 at the package or system level depending on which level the site uses.  
 Refer to the Release Notes for additional information, including detailed
 instructions.
   
 -- COVER SHEET / ENCOUNTERS
   
 - NOIS: HWH-1003-40340 - Cover Sheet and Encounter Form Date Ranges: 
 Significant changes have been made to the date ranges for Cover Sheet 
 visits and Encounter appointments.  Previously there were two date range 
 pairs ("Appt Search" and "Visit Search" Start and Stop date ranges), of 
 which only one in each case was actually used; those split-pair entries 
 governed only the Cover Sheet range prior to GUI 23, with a hard-coded 
 date range used for Encounter Appointments.  In response to requests to 
 change the latter, hard-coded range into site and user-configurable dates,
 in GUI 23 the hard-coded date range for Encounter Appointments was removed
 and the former, split-pair entries were implemented for both Cover Sheet
 and Encounter Appointment date ranges.  That change (in GUI 23) turned out
 to be a less-than-optimal modification.  
   
 As a result, this release implements five new parameters.  Utilizing four
 of the new parameters, updated Tools/Options forms allow users to enter 
 the Cover Sheet "Appointments and visits" date range via the "Date Range 
 Defaults" button and the Encounter form "Encounter Appointments" date 
 range via the "Other Parameters" button in the GUI.  (Matching changes on
 the M side allow IRM or CAC personnel to update the new parameters for all
 levels, not just the User level.)  An additional, fifth new parameter:
 "Future Days Limit For PCE Selection" [ORQQEAFL ENC APPT FUTURE LIMIT] has
 been created to limit the number of days beyond the current day for which
 the "stop" date range limit for Encounter Appointments can be set without
 a warning to the user so as to preclude selecting future appointments
 beyond that allowed according to local policies.  This fifth new parameter
 can only be set on the server side, and NOT at the User level.
   
 The following display illustrates the menu changes on the server (M) side
 under the CAC  "CS GUI Cover Sheet Display Parameters ..." menu option: 
   
      Menu Text prior to OR*3*195  (4 Items):
      ---------------------------------------
      Appt Search Start Date                            
      Appt Search Stop Date                             
      Visit Search Start Date                           
      Visit Search Stop Date
   
      New Menu Text (5 Items):
      -----------------------
      Enc Appt Range Start Offset                           
      Enc Appt Range Stop Offset                            
      Future Days Limit For PCE Selection               
      Cover Sheet Visit Range Start
      Cover Sheet Visit Range Stop
   
  The next display lists entry restrictions for the new parameters:
   
      Cover Sheet Appts & Visits START Range:  -999 days
      Cover Sheet Appts & Visits STOP  Range:  +999 days
      Encounter Appts START Range: Today Minus maximum 999 days    
      Encounter Appts STOP Range:  Today Plus  maximum 999 days
      Future Days Limit For PCE Selection: From 0 to maximum 180 days 
   
  This display explains the process of entering the allowable values:
   
      Cover Sheet Appts & Visits START Range:  Usual "T-xx" Method
      Cover Sheet Appts & Visits STOP  Range:  Usual "T+xx" Method
      Encounter Appts START Range: Positive number BEFORE Today 
      Encounter Appts START Range: Positive number AFTER Today
      Encounter Days Limit for PCE Selection: From 0 to 180 (positive 
                                              number)
   
 INSTALLATION NOTES for these new parameters:  
   
 PACKAGE LEVEL SETTINGS -- During installation of this patch, post-install
 code will examine the DIV^SYS^PKG (Division, System, Package) level 
 settings of the two previously-used parameters ("ORQQVS SEARCH RANGE 
 START" AND "ORQQAP SEARCH RANGE STOP") via a standard $$GET^XPAR call.  
 The results of these calls will be used to populate ONLY the PKG 
 ("Package") level START and STOP settings of the new parameter pairs.  If
 no setting is found, defaults of T-90 and T+90 will be used to populate 
 the new pairs at the Package level.    
   
 USER LEVEL SETTINGS -- The post-install code will examine current user 
 settings for the two previously-used parameters (see above) and stuff them
 into both new parameter pairs.  
   
 NEW PARAMETER #5 - During patch installation, the fifth new parameter 
 ("ORQQEAFL ENC APPT FUTURE LIMIT ) will be populated with a default value
 of 7 at the Package level only.  IMPORTANT WARNING TO IRM/CACs: Please 
 note the default value of 7 for this parameter which occurs during 
 installation; if your site wishes to specify a different "default" future
 limit, edit this parameter immediately following installation and set 
 either the System or Division level settings according to local business
 rules.
   
 What the above installation notes mean is that users will start with both
 the Cover Sheet and Encounter date ranges as they currently have them; the
 individual pairs can then be modified at the user level by individuals as
 desired using the "Tools/Options" menu.  
   
 As usual, default Package level settings are overridden by User level 
 settings, except in the case of the fifth new parameter ("ORQQEAFL ENC 
 APPT FUTURE LIMIT") which cannot be set at the User level.  
  
 -- ORDER SETS
  
 - A problem was noted where, if an Allergy entry was included in an order
 set, and that entry was cancelled at the initial allergy search screen,
 the next one item in succession in the order set would appear on the
 screen simultaneously.  This has been corrected. 
  
 -- CCOW
  
 - A problem was reported in patient safety issue PSI-04-018 where a user
 was able to synchronize to the same patient in both the production and
 mirrored test accounts with two different instances of CPRS.  This should 
 not be allowed and has definite patient safety implications.  This version
 implements XU*8*284 functionality and will distinguish between test and
 production accounts, and synchronization between the two will no longer be
 allowed.  The CPRS fix works with the fix in Care Management patch 
 ORRC*1*1.
  
 - A problem was identified in testing for users holding the ORELSE key 
 and with the site parameter OR SIGNATURE DEFAULT ACTION set to "Release 
 w/o Signature".  On acceptance of a patient change request from another 
 application, the signature box would be presented before the patient 
 change would be allowed to continue.  This was incorrect CCOW behavior in 
 and of itself.  But clicking CANCEL on that signature dialog then 
 resulted in the previous patient's orders still being listed on the 
 Review/Sign Changes screen for the newly synchronized patient.  This 
 potential patient safety issue PSI-04-054 has been corrected.
  
 -- MEDS ORDERING
  
 - When typing a search term in the text box, the list of available meds 
 was not always scrolling so that the first matching item was at the top 
 of the list.  This is now fixed, except in those cases where placing the 
 matching item at the top of the list would result in scrolling the list 
 box to a point beyond where the last available item is initially visible 
 at the bottom.  This is a Windows limitation for which we do not have a 
 programmer workaround. 
  
 PSI-04-055 - Auto-selection of medication schedule.  Prior to GUI v25, 
 the schedule list would auto-select. If Q12H was the first in the list 
 and the provider typed Q1, typed return or tab, Q12H would be selected.
  
 Prior to the non-standard schedule project, the provider was allowed to 
 type in any free text schedule. If it was not in the list, it would be 
 accepted as a non-standard schedule if it passed the format validation.
 With the non-standard schedule project, the provider must now choose from 
 the list or click other to create a valid schedule. 
  
 What is fixed in v25:
 ---------------------
 - If a provider enters a schedule that is not included in the schedule 
   list, the schedule field will remain blank until a valid entry is 
   selected.
 - If a provider enters a single character, the software will fill in the 
   schedule field with the first entry in the schedule list that matches 
   that character.
 What will need to wait for a later release of CPRS GUI:
 -------------------------------------------------------
 - ComboBox controls currently scroll down and match on the first character
   of an entry.  To change this to match on multiple characters, scrolling
   up/down, will require a custom control.
  
 - NOIS: HIN-1203-42283 (PSI-03-060) - A new field, "Duration or Total 
 volume" has been added in the IV fluid order dialog.  By using this field
 a user can specify administrative duration or total volume for the IV
 order.
  
 - NOIS: UNY-0103-12342 - Changing only the dispense unit field in 
 outpatient pharmacy did not create a new order with changed dispense 
 units on the CPRS side and eventually caused mismatched orders.  This 
 has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CPH-1203-42234 (PSI-03-059)- In the medication order dialog, the
 dosage box will not allow automatic selection based on matching for the
 first character provider entered in dosage list.  The length of matched
 characters is calculated by the length of the shortest dosage characters 
 minus 1; e.g. Warfarin has list of dispense dose unit: 1.25mg, 2mg, 
 2.5mg, 12.5mg, the shortest dosage characters is 3 (2mg -- 3 characters),
 so the length of matched characters is 2 (3-1). If user typed 2m, the 2mg
 will be auto-selected. 
 When a dosage NOT in the available dosages list is entered (i.e. free text
 dosage), it will only be added to the available dosage list for the
 outpatient medication order when it is a multiple of one of the available
 dosages; e.g. if you have 50 mg, 100 mg, and 500 mg you could enter free
 text 150 mg, 1000 mg, or 200 mg for that one time only and it would appear
 at the bottom on the list.
  
 - NOIS: TUA-0104-31631 - When choosing a med for outpatient use that 
 contains a dosage built to use half tablets along with a whole tablet, 
 the dosage was not expanding to read correctly in the CPRS instruction 
 field.  An example would be Lopressor 75mg.  This dosage is built on the 
 50mg tab.  When the 75mg dose is chosen, it should read one and one-half 
 tablet in the instruction field in CPRS instead of 1.5 tablets.  This has 
 been fixed.
  
 -- NON VA MEDS
  
 - The Comments section of the Non-VA Med order form now only displays the 
 expanded schedule.
  
 - NOIS: DUR-0704-31206 - An electronic signature is no longer required
 upon discontinuing a Non-VA med.
  
 -- PROBLEM LIST
  
 - NOIS: MAC-0904-60407 (PSI-04-048) - If editing a problem, and attempting
 to select a new patient before saving the changes, the user is prompted to
 either "Discard Changes or Cancel".  Selecting "Cancel" would result in a
 new patient being selected without the problem edit screen being cleared.
 Navigating to the Problems tab for the new patient would display the
 previous entry underway for the previous patient.  This had patient safety
 implications and has been fixed. 
  
 - In v22 through v24, the Problems tab was inadvertently not made 
 "CCOW-aware".  If a problem were being edited and a patient change 
 request were received from another application, the user was not advised 
 of the consequences of accepting the patient change before saving the 
 problem changes.  This has been fixed.
  
 - The buttons on the "Discard changes?" dialog box have been changed from 
 "OK/Cancel" to "Yes/No", for reasons of clarity.
  
 -- PROVIDER SELECTION LISTS
  
 - NOIS: TOM-0503-41438 - Previous functionality that showed additional 
 information in Provider selection lists made it easier to assure 
 selection of the correct Provider, especially in the case of duplicate 
 names.  Performance in retrieving the lists suffered somewhat and a 
 Provider who previously had made a Remote Data Views ("remote") connection
 to a site was created as a user at that site with an alias of "Visitor".  
 If that user subsequently became a staff member at that facility, the
 provider would not show on the provider selection lists.  A new cross
 reference and enhanced Kernel code are now utilized to improve
 performance, and to assure that anyone who is currently located at that
 facility and is a Provider shows on Provider lists. This is related to
 patient safety issue PSI-03-051.
  
 -- TEMPLATE DIALOGS
  
 - Code improvements have been included to improve performance in template
 dialogs.
  
 -- EVENT DELAYED ORDERS
  
 - NOIS: HUN-0103-20454 - After changing the released event default order 
 under the event view, the newly-changed order showed up under event view 
 only with delayed status.  Under "active view" the order was not 
 displayed.  This has been fixed.  The new changed event default order is 
 now displayed in both the active view and event view on the orders tab 
 with unreleased status.
  
 - NOIS: BAY-1003-32131, LIT-0903-71958, CLE-0903-41758, SAJ-0903-71602, 
 LOM-0803-61259, MOU-0803-30190, LEX-0603-41753, FAV-0403-71497, 
 ALB-0204-51996 (PSI-03-036 - PSI-04-010)- A number of sites reported 
 problems with pharmacy orders that showed a status of active on the meds
 tab and in BCMA, but which were discontinued on the CPRS side.  It was
 discovered that the orders were being released more than once as part of
 the delayed order processing.  In each instance, the MAS movement
 information was being edited shortly after being entered.  The protocol
 processing from the initial entry of data had not completed before the
 processing for the subsequent update began.  In the reported instances,
 the processes were simultaneously releasing orders, which caused the
 problem with the pharmacy orders.
  
 While researching the above problem it was noted that the first protocol 
 processed on the DGPM PATIENT MOVEMENT list inadvertently released the 
 lock on the patient record so that other movements could be entered or 
 edited.  The lock should be maintained until the entire list of protocols 
 has been processed.  Patch DG*5.3*549 addresses the locking issue from 
 the MAS side, which should greatly reduce the possibility of events being 
 simultaneously processed.  Meanwhile, in addition to the MAS problem, it 
 was also discovered that a user could be attempting to manually release 
 orders while orders were being released due to the entry of an MAS 
 movement or vice-versa.  The DG patch will now lock the event so that 
 only one process can be acting on an event.  Patch DG*5.3*549 will now 
 maintain the lock on the patient's movement record until protocol
 processing has finished.  This will stop users from simultaneously
 processing the patient's movement information.  In addition, updates have
 been added to CPRS code so that users cannot be attempting to manually
 release orders while the event is being processed.  Conversely, if a user
 is manually releasing orders, the processing of the delayed event due to a
 patient movement will be held until the user is finished with the manual
 release of orders.
  
 - NOIS: LAH-1203-61784  - In very rare cases it is possible for the same 
 internal entry number to be used during event delayed order writing.  
 This was caused by a lock being released before the data was written to 
 the global.  The lock action has been moved to a later point to make sure 
 that all data is recorded before releasing the entry.
  
 - NOIS: AMA-0403-71196 - When a patient is discharged, all existing 
 delayed events that were written during the admission and haven't been 
 acted on yet are canceled.  There is a problem canceling the events when 
 the event is a child of another event.  In this case, only the parent 
 event and its related orders are canceled and the child orders are left 
 alone.  These orders cannot be acted upon after the parent is canceled.  
 After installation of this patch the child orders and the child event 
 will also be canceled.
  
 - NOIS: NOIS: CAH-0404-31873 (PSI-04-020) - Delayed complex lab orders 
 (e.g. CBC Q12 x 3) were not correctly assigned a location upon release 
 from delayed status.  The parent order held the location but the 
 individual "child" orders were not assigned a location.  A change was made
 so that the location is assigned to the child orders when the delayed
 event occurs.
  
 -- ORDERS
  
 - NOIS: MAC-1101-62553, TUC-0103-62288 - When an orderset contains an 
 ordermenu and inside that ordermenu another orderset is contained, when 
 the lower-level orderset was executed through conclusion the user could 
 not return to the upper-level ordermenu for selection.  This was fixed.
  
 - NOIS: MIN-0203-42113 - If a provider changed a pending order's priority 
 to "done" the original order did not get discontinued and the status
 stayed as pending.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: JAC-1202-71057 - Outpatient medications given during treatment 
 were asked for co-pay exemptions.  That should not have been asked.  This 
 has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: SHR-0603-70545 - In the list manager interface, if the last order 
 processed for a patient when building the active orders list is a renewed 
 prescription, the verify options are not displayed when the order is 
 selected.  After the patch installation, this will no longer be a problem.
  
 - NOIS: MIN-0304-42815 - When discontinuing a complex order, all child 
 orders were discontinued. On the "Review/Sign Changes" window or "Sign
 selected orders" windows the user was allowed to uncheck each individual
 child order, leave some of the child orders signed, and some others
 unsigned.  This has been fixed.  The Provider must now sign all or none of
 the child orders after a discontinue action.
  
 - NOIS: ATG-0304-32328 - After opening the order dialog and then switching
 to another tab, the order dialog was forced to close.  This has been
 fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CPH-0703-42298, NTH-0703-71061 - This patch corrects an interface
 display defect. Upon entering a lab quick order a user can enter a value
 for the "Collection Date/Time". If the first character of the user input
 is equal to T and if it is offset by number value of one, and it contains
 a "+" the display variable is incorrectly set to "TOMORROW" and returned 
 to be displayed.  The last character, which the units of time offset from
 today, is not tested before the display variable is set. So the user can
 input date values of T+1D (today plus one day), T+1W (today plus one
 week), T+1M (today plus one month), and T+1Y (today plus one year) and be
 displayed "TOMORROW" for all of them.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: PAL-0704-60893 (PSI-04-042) - When there is an EDUCATIONAL 
 DESCRIPTION and two or more MESSAGEs for a RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE, only the
 first MESSAGE is displayed upon ordering. This has been corrected to
 display all MESSAGEs.
  
 -- REMINDERS DIALOGS
  
 - NOIS: CHS-0103-41180 - 
 Problem: Historical Dates Entered Through Reminder Dialogs Not Updating
          PCE
 Developers fixed a problem involving historical dates entered through
 Reminder dialogs that did not update PCE. To correct this problem,
 developers no longer use the TaskMan variable ZTSYNC if the encounter date
 is a historical date. By not setting this variable, TaskMan will not check
 file #14.8 for the encounter visit string. As soon as this patch is
 installed, sites can file historical encounter data for any date. This
 patch only fixes the problem for any historical date entered AFTER this
 patch is installed.
 Sites will need to do some clean up on their systems if the site was
 having a problem with a historical date (i.e. 11/14/2001 or 11/2001).
  
 Fix: Instructions for Correcting Inaccurate Historical Data
 There is a coding fix to prevent future problems. In addition, the 
 following steps provide a manual clean-up of old data. The three steps to 
 the manual fix are outlined in detail below with example screen captures 
 of the process.  The three steps are:
  
 1. Identify entries in file 14.8 (TASK SYNC FLAG) that were blocked by
    TaskMan.  
 2. Identify any encounter dates that are still pending with a status of 4
    in file 14.4 (TASKS) that end with E, i.e. ORW0;3040100;E (see example
    below).
 3. Requeue all pending jobs to be filed by TaskMan.
  
 Note:  Any historical data that was entered before CPRS 25 that does not
        show in PCE will need to be manually cleaned up.
  
 Manual Clean-up Step 1:
  
 Steps to check if your site has historical data blocked by TaskMan
  
 1. Go to the main FileMan menu 
 2. Select "SEARCH FILE ENTRIES" option # 3 
 3. Select file number 14.8 for the file to search through 
 4. At the "SEARCH FOR TASK SYNC FLAG FIELD:" prompt, type "Name" 
 5. At the "CONDITION:" prompt, type "contains" 
 6. At the CONTAINS: prompt, type ";E~" 
 7. Sort by Name 
 8. Request the output to print both the Number (IEN) and the Name field
 9. If a list is returned, then you have previous Historical Encounter date
    that has been blocked by FileMan

 - NOIS: PUG-0404-51789 - Reminder Dialogs were showing duplicate items 
 but the duplicate items did not have any affect on the dialogs.  This has 
 been corrected.
  
 - NOIS: SLC-0901-51635 (PSI-04-001) - This fixes the problem with data
 entered into template field(s) not appearing in the progress note when 
 multiple reminders are process and the template field(s) are not on the 
 final dialog.
  
 -- PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS
  
 - NOIS: MAD-1001-41873 - A server error at VADPT0+6, happening if a null 
 value for the DFN was somehow passed to the patient demographics call, 
 was corrected.
  
 -- 508 ISSUES
  
 - Window-Eyes will now read the Check List Box on the CIDC Sign / Review 
 and Sign Orders screens. This requires the window-eyes (WE) configuration
 file "CPRSCHAR.we" to be installed on the machine running WE, into
 "WINEYES\Users\Default" directory.
  
 - The CIDC Sign/Review and sign orders dialogs do not require a person to 
 press CTRL+SHIFT+S. The application will automatically detect if a screen
 reader is running, and activate the previous CTRL+SHIFT+S functionality.
  
 - If a user cancels out of the Select Lab Tests window on the Labs tab,
 the focus now remains on the correct Lab Test.
  
 - The tab order in the About Dialog now starts on the first Text object.  
 Also, the user can tab through all of the text and not just part of it. 
 This allows screen readers to read the text.
  
 - The text displayed in the Copy Orders Dialog can now be tabbed to and 
 read by screen readers.  The tab order has also been fixed, and the 
 listbox that appears now has a label so the screen reader user will know 
 the tabbing destination.
  
 - List boxes and combo boxes in general now select, by default, the first 
 Item in the list when no item has been previously selected and the 
 control did not gain focus from a mouse click. 
  
 - All forms that save their size and positioning using LOADSIZ & SAVESIZ 
 now use a common object to save the data rather than making an RPC call 
 every time the Form is open and closed.  One call is made when the 
 application closes, saving the sizing and positioning data with a single 
 RPC call.  Nothing visual should be noticed, but this change should 
 result in overall improved server side performance.
  
 - JAWS now reads the Clinic Appointments/Visits list caption correctly in 
 the Provider & Location for Current Activities dialog.
  
 - Using ALT-V-M on the Notes Tab brings up the List Selected Documents 
 window. 
  
 - When Editing/Creating a Note you can now tab to drawer buttons.
  
 - Navigation to the Drawer buttons could occur via the arrow keys when 
 hidden. Navigating the drawer buttons with the arrow keys has been 
 disabled so that a visually impaired user does not get lost.
  
 - After signing, a note is removed from All Unsigned Notes panel.  
 Previously there was no focus on the Note TreeView.  Now the first Item 
 in the TreeView gains focus.
  
 - In connection with the "Location for Current Activities Form", you can 
 now navigate to the Hospital Admission and new visit tabs via the 
 keyboard.
  
 - The tabs on the Encounter form can now gain focus and be accessed with 
 the keyboard.
  
 - "View Options" and "Problem Categories" no longer overlay each other 
  after opening a new or edit problem window.  The tab order also stays 
  consistent afterwards now.
  
 - When the Service edit box is selected in the Change Problem window, 
 JAWS no longer speaks 'Politic' or something similar.
  
 - Non-modal dialogs now keep their focus when the user leaves the 
 application and comes back into the application.
  
 - The "Signature will be applied to checked items" label no longer 
 disappears when the Review/Sign changes dialog form is resized.
  
 - The Remote Data CIRN ListBox, when visible, now acts as if it falls in 
 the tab order between the CIRN button/panel and the Reminders 
 button/panel.
  
 - Changed date format in Select Patient dialog (fPtSel) from yyyy/mm/dd to
 dd/mm/yyyy.
  
 - On the Consult Dialog form, a user can now browse the Service/Specialty
 list with up and down arrows and select one with the Enter key or 
 spacebar.
  
 - Tabbing to the tabs in the Options Dialog window can now occur.  
  
 - The Consults, Refill, and Renew dialog forms can now store previous 
 size settings, and adjust correctly for font changes.
  
 - NOIS: BUT-1003-20695 - Three panels were added to the Problems Edit
 form.  It can now handle all font sizes above 8.
  
 - Send Alert windowpane title captions now display correctly.
  
 - The Date Range dialog boxes in Note Properties now highlight the text 
 when they receive focus.
  
 - Following a Problem List Lexicon Search, focus returns to the listbox.
  
 - Shift+tab now moves backwards in the tab order correctly from the New 
 Notes RichEdit control.
  
 - In the Template Editor Dialog, after checking the Active checkbox, 
 focus is set to the Active check box - if it can obtain focus.
  
 - The Preview Template Dialog form now stores previous size settings.
  
 - On the Reports tab, the tabs were changed to actual tabs instead of 
 buttons.  Now RDV reports will refresh when navigated with arrow keys.
  
 - Date Range - Selected Date Range - on the Reports tab - no longer 
 generates an invalid date error when clicking "Cancel."
  
 - Garbage characters behind the up and down arrows on the ADHOC Health 
 Summary Form were removed.
  
 - The Chart dialog on the Orders tab form will now display 10+ font sizes 
 correctly.
  
 - In CWAD Patient Postings, screen readers will now read the label at the 
 top of allergies list box. Added close button too.
  
 - With Imaging orders, the Imaging type combobox now reads correctly with 
 Window-Eyes.
  
 - Added TCaptionListBox=MS Active  - Accessibility to the Windows Classes 
 definition, in the JAWS def file. 
  
 - Custom list boxes on the Meds tab will now read with JAWS.
  
 - On the Consults tab, screen readers no longer read 2 hidden controls 
 when using arrow keys to move from the New Consult button.
  
 - With regard to the Consults Tab Alt-A-C-P keystroke combinations: The 
 text of the Print Screen can be tabbed to and now screen readers have 
 access to the text.
  
 - When ordering a Consult from a menu, on the prerequisite screen the 
 Continue and Cancel buttons were fixed so that they don't overlap when 
 the font size is changed.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0803-51430 - The consults prerequisite ("pop-up box") now 
 opens at the top instead of the bottom when long text is in the box.
  
 - In the Edit/Add Problem dialog, a message was added to tell the user 
 that they need to close the Edit/Add Problem dialog in order to change 
 the font sizes, and the font resize operation is restricted until the 
 user does so.
  
 - NOIS: STX-1203-71584, BUT-0704-21314 (PSI-04-039) - The Cancel and OK
 buttons will now be available with larger font sizes in the Edit/Add
 Problem dialog.
  
 - A message was added in the Reminder Dialog telling the user that the
 reminder dialog must be closed in order to change the font sizes.
  
 - The font resizing issue in the Patient lookup dialog is now fixed.
 The problem was: with larger fonts the patient lookup dialog was 
 unreadable.
  
 - During Discharge Summary signing, when you select the "Identify 
 Additional Signers" option (Alt+A+I) with no Matching Summary selected, a 
 message informing the user is now displayed.
  
 - Discharge Summaries Keystrokes: Alt-A-M, Alt-A-C, Alt-A-B, Alt-A-L, 
 Alt-A-D, Alt-A-E, Alt-A-G now display a message if a Discharge Summary 
 has not been selected.
  
 - NOIS: MAC-0903-60683 - The focus in the info box for lab orders was at 
 the end of the box when there were more than two lines of text. Now the 
 focus is at the top of the box.  This resolves patient safety issue 
 PSI-04-023.
  
 - NOIS: RIC-0204-22248 - The focus in the info box for Radiology/Nuclear 
 Medicine orders was at the end of the box when there were more than two 
 lines of text. Now the focus is at the top of the box.
  
 -- CODE SET VERSIONING
  
 - When CSV support was added to GUI v22, not all required CSV patches had 
 yet been released.  Numerous checks for the presence of these patches 
 were included in the code to ensure correct behavior in either their 
 presence or their absence.  Since all of these patches have now been 
 released, and the mandatory install date has long since passed, these 
 checks have now been removed in the interest of performance, especially 
 as related to the encounter form.  The CSV patches have instead been 
 added to the REQUIRED BUILDS list for this version.
  
 - On the Problems tab, inactive problems with inactive ICD codes were 
 flagged with the "#" marker on the "Both Active and Inactive" view, but 
 not on the "Inactive" view.  The "#" will now appear for these problems 
 in both cases.
  
 -- TOOLS MENU
  
 - NOIS: ANN-1203-40706 - The Tools menu currently supports the definition 
 of only 31 items via the ORWT TOOLS MENU parameter.  If more than this 
 number happened to be defined a "range check" error would occur on 
 startup, causing CPRS to shut down.  This error has now been prevented 
 and a warning provided to the user which specifies that all defined
 items may not be displayed.
  
 - An error message would appear if a site had inconsistent local file 
 entries for the "Options/Tools" menu.  Such entries should not normally 
 occur inasmuch as XPAR entry validation normally precludes the 
 inconsistencies.  On the Delphi side, a warning message will now also 
 appear and the application will continue to run.
  
 - The warning message about too many items defined for the tools menu has 
 been moved from the initial CPRS startup sequence to the first time a 
 user clicks on the Tools menu to open it.  The warning will only be 
 displayed the first time the Tools menu is displayed.
  
 -- NOTES/CONSULTS/DISCHARGE SUMMARY/SURGERY TABS
  
 - If a user is disconnected from the server after creating a new 
 document, but before any text has been either saved or autosaved, the 
 result is a blank unsigned document in TIU.  On a hard disconnect, there 
 is no way for either CPRS or TIU to prevent this from happening.  In 
 previous versions, if the user then logged in again, and attempted to 
 sign that blank document, ignoring the warning about "possible missing 
 text", a signed blank document would result.  In this version, if the 
 document is empty, as determined via a TIU API also used in ListManager,
 the signature action will flatly be disallowed.
  
 - NOIS: TUA-0104-31822, MON-0304-52402, PSI-04-016 - In previous versions,
 there was no indication to the user if an autosave experienced an error,
 usually on a long note and usually because of unknown connectivity
 issues.  On occasion, a cryptic developer debugging message would be
 displayed, but was of little use to the user and which also caused CPRS to
 shutdown.  In this version, if an error occurs, the user will be advised
 to retry via CTRL-SHIFT-S (save and continue) or "Save without signature"
 to improve chances of recovery of any text that was not correctly saved
 due to the error.  If this process continues to fail, the user is
 instructed to copy/paste the text of the note to MS-Word before continuing
 or exiting CPRS.  
  
 - v25 includes one additional code modification on these TIU tabs to 
 specifically respond to the type of error corrected in XWB*1.1*35, that of
 an incomplete read by the Broker server, leading to truncated notes.  
 Although XWB*1.1*35 will attempt to recover from the error on the server, 
 v25 will allow the user to recover more easily if this specific error 
 continues to occur, by displaying the same informational message displayed
 in the case of other save errors. This completes all pending changes for
 PSI-04-016 (truncated note text) in v25.
  
 -- TIU / NOTES 
  
 - A fix was made which addresses an issue with the RPC "TIU ONE VISIT 
 NOTE?"  When determining if more than one note of a particular Document
 Type is allowed to be added to a particular visit, the RPC was not using
 a guaranteed method of choosing the correct visit.  This patch eliminates
 the possibility of the RPC choosing an incorrect visit to check.
  
 - NOIS: CHA-0403-30277 - CPRS GUI was incorrectly passing a TIU document 
 IEN of "0".  Although the cause has never been determined, defensive code 
 has been added to the server to prevent the "M" error and also to prevent 
 incorrect data filing.  TIU*1*167 was also part of the fix.
  
 -- DISCHARGE SUMMARIES
  
 - NOIS: STX-1103-71286 - The TIU document parameter allowing or 
 disallowing more than one note per visit was not being respected for 
 documents in the Discharge Summary class on this tab.  It is HIGHLY 
 RECOMMENDED that the overall DISCHARGE SUMMARY class be set to restrict 
 its members to one occurrence per admission, and that if multiple interim 
 summaries are to be used that the parameter be set individually for those 
 titles, thus overriding the CLASS setting.  Until this version, only one 
 document of the DISCHARGE SUMMARY class was allowed per admission, 
 regardless of the value of the document parameter. 
  
 -- REMINDERS
  
 - NOIS: PUG-1203-51384 - A GUI 25 Reminder Dialog will only look at the 
 Indent Progress Note to determine if a Dialog Group sub-items should be 
 indented in the Progress Note
  
 - The Service Connections Prompts from the Reminder Dialog Finish Process 
 have been removed.
  
 -- ENCOUNTERS
  
 - NOIS: ASH-0700-31595 - Workload will no longer be required when signing
 notes for cancelled or no-show appointments.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-1003-51933 - When signing documents from the review/sign 
 changes screen, the same workload checks that were functioning correctly 
 on the "Action/Sign Note Now" menu were not being correctly applied.  
 This has been corrected.
  
 -- ALERTS
  
 - NOIS: BOI-1003-51104, HUN-0803-21979 - When forwarding an alert, if the 
 user enters <CR> when entering the forwarding comment, the receiver of 
 the alert gets the ' List Index out of bounds (7)' error.  This has been 
 fixed.  
  
 -- CONSULTS / PROCEDURES ORDERING
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0303-52230 - If a note was being viewed on the Consults tab, 
 it was not possible to take any action on it from the Notes tab.  In 
 v25, actions on the Notes tab will only be prevented if the note is 
 actually being edited on the Consults tab.  The reverse scenario was 
 already working correctly.  
  
 - When ordering a Consult from a menu, the prerequisite screen now saves 
 its size.
  
 - When ordering a new procedure via the basic dialog, and not using a 
 quick order, a message would be displayed about "no services available 
 for this procedure".  This has been prevented, since no procedure has yet 
 been selected.
  
 -- CARE MANAGEMENT
  
 Two changes have been made to CPRS to correct problems exhibited in Care 
 Management. 
  
 - NOIS: MAN-0304-10554 -The first problem involves the resulting of lab 
 tests ordered as a panel. If a test is resulted as critical or abnormal 
 and verified, the headlight color in Care Management displays 
 appropriately as a red square. If lab verifies a different test in the 
 panel at a later time as normal, the headlight color reverts to blue due 
 to the overwriting of the abnormal result flag stored with the order.  
 This problem is corrected so that the abnormal flag is maintained and the 
 headlight display in Care Management is correct.
  
 - NOIS: PAL-0204-60417, MIN-0504-41044, CLA-0704-20322 - The second 
 problem is seen when a group update of Consults is done and the consults 
 are set to Complete. Care Management was producing a Result headlight to 
 the ordering provider for every patient that had a consult group updated. 
 The ordering provider is intentionally excluded from receiving 
 notifications on these consults and should be exempt from acknowledging 
 these results in Care Management. With this patch, group updated consults 
 will no longer require a result acknowledgement.
  
 -- IMO Enhancement 
  
 - Under IMO authorized location, for an outpatient, new placed IV fluid 
 order will be saved under "Clin. Meds" group instead of "IV Fluid" group.
  
 -- AUTOUPDATE
  
 - CPRS GUI v26 will require an additional Dynamic Link Library (DLL) to 
 be accessible in the workstation's search path in order to execute at 
 all.  That DLL (BORLNDMM.DLL) is currently being exported in advance with 
 CPRS v25 to ensure that it is in place before v26 arrives and requires 
 its presence.  In v25, the existing autoupdate functionality has been 
 enhanced so that this DLL will be copied to the workstation from the GOLD 
 server directory at the same time that the EXE and HLP files are updated. 
 This update should occur when autoupdating from any earlier CPRS version 
 to v25 or higher. The update can be confirmed by the presence of 
 BORLNDMM.DLL in the same directory as CPRSChart.EXE on the workstation 
 after the autoupdate.
  
 -- MISCELLANEOUS
  
 - NOIS: HIN-0404-42233 - Remote procedure MAG4 REMOTE IMPORT will now be 
 registered to the option OR CPRS GUI CHART by the V25 post-install, 
 provided that patch MAG*3.0*7, which exported that RPC, is found to be 
 present in the target account.

 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The "JAWS_Scripts_195.ZIP" file contains configuration files that
 replace the file in "informational" patch OR*3.0*126.  These configuration
 files will need to be copied to the <JAWS>\SETTINGS\ENU\ file on all
 workstations using JAWS.  JAWS power users will likely want to install 
 and customize these files themselves. 
  
 The "Window_Eyes_195.ZIP" file contains configuration files that
 replace the file in "informational" patch OR*3*126. These configuration
 files will need to be copied to the <WINEYES>\Users\Default\ file on all
 workstations using Window-Eyes.  Window-Eyes power users will likely want 
 to install and customize these files themselves.
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================= 
  
 CPRS GUI version 25 consists of three patches. The patches are combined in
 host file OR_3_195_PSJ_PSS.KID in order to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Installation of this host
 file should be coordinated among the three packages affected since only
 one installation is necessary. The patches are:
   
   PSS*1*59       PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT
   PSJ*5*111      INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
   OR*3*195       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
  
 Detailed instructions on the installation and post-installation steps 
 necessary to install this software are listed below.
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.  This
 patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption.  
 Installation will take approximately 5 minutes or more, depending on the
 menu structure at your site.
  
 Note:   IMO features will not be available in the CPRS until patch 
 SD*5.3*285 is installed in your account. This patch is currently under 
 development.
  
  
  
  1.  Obtain the file OR_30_195_PSJ_PSS.KID.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of the four patches are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
      select the Installation menu.
   
  4.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_195_PSJ_PSS.KID when prompted to
      Enter a Host File name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
   
  5.  If given the option to run any Environment Check Routine(s), answer 
      "YES."
   
  6.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter CPRS BUNDLE GUI 25.0):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
   
  7.  When ready, select the Install Packages option (when prompted for 
      the INSTALL NAME, enter CPRS BUNDLE GUI 25.0).
   
  8.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? Yes//", respond "YES."
   
  9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//', respond "YES." 
   
  10. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
         OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN          CPRS Clinician Menu
         OR OE/RR MENU NURSE              CPRS Nurse Menu
         OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK         CPRS Ward Clerk Menu
         OR CPRS GUI CHART
         SDBUILD                          Set up a Clinic
   
  11. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0.'
   
  12. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
  
  13. Following successful installation, the pre/post-install and 
      environment check routines ORY195 and ORY195V may be deleted.
   
  14. Retrieve and open the file OR_30_195.ZIP.
   
  15. Place the User and Technical Manual files in a location that can 
      be accessed by CPRS users.
   
  16. Move the CPRSChart.exe and help files to the appropriate directory 
      where they can be accessed by all CPRS workstations.
   
  17. Provide the JAWS support script files to JAWS users.
   
  18. If your site wishes to specify a different "default" future limit 
      from the 7 days entry created at the Package level for the parameter 
      "ORQQEAFL ENC APPT FUTURE LIMIT" during patch installation, edit 
      this parameter immediately following the installation process and 
      modify either the system or division level setting to reflect local 
      business rules.
  
  19. For CPRS to display the Clinic Medications display group on the 
      Orders tab (the display group that shows Inpatient Medications for
      Outpatients), sites will need to make an entry in the ORWOR CATEGORY
      SEQUENCE parameter at the package or system level depending on which 
      level the site uses.  Refer to the Release Notes for additional
      information, including detailed instructions.
