Subject: CORRECT 'DELETE ITEMS' LIST 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently while updating an encounter, 'UE - Update Encounter' in PCE, you
 can choose the protocol 'DE Delete Item'. This lists the encounter itself
 as well as all V-Files pointing to the encounter. You may then choose an
 item from this list to delete. If you choose #1 for the encounter itself
 it says that it is deleting the encounter. However, the encounter is not
 actually deleted. A patch may be developed to address this. However, in the
 interim, this patch will display only items 2 through the end of the list
 - thereby eliminating confusion as to why it looks like the encounter is
 deleted when in fact it is not.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 UNY-0804-12129 - Question in regards to deleting encounters made in error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Delete Item choice under Update Encounter looks like you can delete 
 the encounter itself. However, the code does not do this. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Exclude the encounter itself (list item 1 on the screen) from the list of 
 elements to be deleted.
  
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
  
 In routine PXCEAE at line tag DOMANY+9 pass a parameter of 2 instead of 1.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.  Users do not have to be off the system.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still display the patch text
    only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter PX*1.0*156)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*156.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
         PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY         PCE Encounter Data Entry
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE     PCE Encounter Data Entry and
                                                             Delete
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE    PCE Encounter Data Entry  
                                                             without Delete
         PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER        PCE Encounter Data Entry -
                                                             Supervisor
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
