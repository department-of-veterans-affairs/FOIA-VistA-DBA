              message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
              backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
              patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch
              (routines, DDs, templates, etc.,).
           c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
              ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
