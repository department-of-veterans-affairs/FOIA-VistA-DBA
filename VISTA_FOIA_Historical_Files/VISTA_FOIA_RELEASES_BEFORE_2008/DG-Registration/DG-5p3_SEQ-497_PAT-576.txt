Subject: FIX COMBAT VET ELIGIBILITY ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes an error from the Combat Veteran Interim Solution (patch 
 DG*5.3*528).  The error was that a veteran was listed as Expired instead 
 of Eligible on the Combat Veteran End Date.  Because of this if veterans 
 applied for treatment on the exact End Date they would be subjected to 
 billing when they should be exempt for combat related conditions.  The 
 Combat Veteran End Date is field #.5295 in the PATIENT file (#2).
  
 This patch corrects the supported API from DG*5.3*528 that calculates CV
 status.  It also creates an API for use by the Integrated Billing package
 to find any veterans who might have been incorrectly billed due to this
 error.  This Registration API will be used by a future IB patch to produce
 a list of patients who were billed for medical treatment on the day that
 their Combat Veteran eligibility expired.  (Integration Agreement #4312).
  
 This patch also uses a supported DBIA (#10103) to calculate a date two 
 years in the future of an input date.
