 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
  
 1. HD0000000138312   Getting Holiday Was Encapsulated by Non-Pay Warning
  
 Patch PRS*4*102 introduced new functionality that reports an exception "HX
 was encapsulated by non-pay" when a holiday excused posting is
 encapsulated by without pay or non pay. This new functionality does not
 work correctly under two different circumstances. The following options
 can perform the holiday encapsulation check:
  
   List Daily Exceptions            [PRSA TPE ONE-SUP]
   List Daily Exceptions            [PRSA TPE ONE]
   Display Pay Period Exceptions    [PRSA TPE ALL-SUP]
   Display Pay Period Exceptions    [PRSA TPE ALL]
   List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA SUP PPE]
   Display Employee Pay Period      [PRSA TPD PP]
   Display Employee Pay Period      [PRSA PE DISP]
   Display Employee Pay Period      [PRSA TPD PP-SUP]
   Post Employee Time               [PRSA TK POST]
  
 The two problems are described below:
  
 Problem 1A:
 -----------
 Software may look in wrong pay period for the prior scheduled tour day.
  
 The software attempts to find the first scheduled tour day that is prior
 to a holiday excused posting as part of the encapsulation checks. If the
 first prior tour day is in a different pay period from the holiday, the
 software will correctly move backward across pay periods until the pay
 period containing the holiday is transmitted to Austin. Once that pay
 period is transmitted, the software will inappropriately move backward
 from day 1 of the holiday pay period to day 14 of the holiday pay period
 instead of moving into the prior pay period. The encapsulation check may
 return the wrong result when the wrong day is checked for without pay/non
 pay.
  
       Example:
       ------------------------------------------------
       Pay Period 2  Day 13  Friday     Scheduled Tour
                     Day 14  Saturday   Day Off
       ------------------------------------------------
       Pay Period 3  Day 1   Sunday     Day Off
       Pay Period 3  Day 2   Monday     Holiday Excused
       .
       .
       .
       Pay Period 3  Day 13  Friday     Scheduled Tour
       Pay Period 3  Day 14  Saturday   Day Off
       -------------------------------------------------
  
 In this example, the software will correctly identify Day 13 in Pay Period
 2 as the first scheduled tour day that is prior to the holiday until Pay
 Period 3 is transmitted. At that point, the software will inappropriately
 identify Day 13 in Pay Period 3 as the first scheduled tour day that is
 prior to the holiday when performing the encapsulation checks.
  
 Resolution 1A:
 --------------
 This patch corrects the software so the correct pay period is used.
  
  
 Problem 1B:
 -----------
 A tour partially posted with WP or NP may result in an inappropriate
 exception message. The software attempts to find the first scheduled tour
 day prior to the holiday and the first scheduled tour day after the
 holiday as part of the encapsulation checks. If the first tour day before
 or after the holiday contains an exception of WP (without pay) or NP (non
 pay) AND if the 15 minutes of the tour closest to the holiday does not
 have any exception (such as WP or SL or AL, etc...) the software will fail
 to recognize that the holiday is not encapsulated by non pay. Instead it
 will inappropriately keep looking for a different tour day to check.  
 Depending on how the subsequent tour day is posted, the software could
 inappropriately consider the holiday to be encapsulated. This patch will
 fix the software so it will identify this situation as a holiday that is
 not encapsulated.
  
       Example of problem when software is looking for the prior tour day:
  
       Day 1  Sunday      Day Off
       Day 2  Monday      Scheduled Tour entirely posted as WP
       Day 3  Tuesday     Scheduled Tour with some WP, but last 15 minutes 
                          worked
       Day 4  Wednesday   Holiday Excused
  
 In this example, the software fails to recognize that the holiday is not
 encapsulated by without pay due to the last 15 minutes of Tuesday having
 been worked. It then inappropriately checks Monday as if it was the first
 prior scheduled tour day before the holiday and incorrectly determines
 that the time immediately before the holiday was posted as WP.
  
 Resolution 1B:
 --------------
 This patch corrects the software so only the days on either side of the
 holiday will be checked.
  
  
 2. HD0000000138040   Overtime Entry Invalid or Pay Plan Error Exists 
  
 Patch PRS*4*102 introduced new business rules for the determination of 
 overtime. However, some of the software requirements for that patch have
 since been identified as incorrect. The incorrect software requirements
 resulted in two problems that will be addressed by patch PRS*4*108.
  
 Problem 2A:
 -----------
 80 hours in a pay period should not be used as criteria for overtime.
  
 The software requirements for patch PRS*4*102 stated that time worked 
 outside the normal tour by a part-time or intermittent employee that 
 exceeded 80 hours in the pay period should be reported as overtime. Upon
 further review, payroll policy has stated that this use of 80 hours in a
 pay period as a criteria for overtime is inappropriate.
  
 Because the software checks for 80 hours/pay period, it is possible for a
 timecard to get regular overtime in week 2 (OE) without 40 hours worked in
 week 2 as long as there was more than 40 hours worked in week 1. This
 inappropriate overtime would have been rejected by Central PAID with the
 message "Overtime Entry Invalid or Pay Plan Error Exists."
  
 Resolution 2A:
 --------------
 Patch PRS*4*108 will resolve the problem for future pay periods by
 removing the 80 hours/pay period criteria.
  
  
 Problem 2B:
 -----------
 Overtime greater than 8 hours/day and greater than 40 hours/week should be
 reported as Hours Excess 8 Day (DA/DE)
  
 The software requirements for patch PRS*4*102 stated that overtime by 
 part-time and intermittent employees should be reported as regular 
 overtime (OA/OE) when it exceeded both 8 hours/day and 40 hours/week.  
 Upon further review, payroll policy has stated that such overtime should
 be reported as Hours Excess 8 Day (DA/DE).
  
 Resolution 2B:
 --------------
 Patch PRS*4*108 will update the software accordingly.
  
  
 3. HD0000000141551   Part-Time Dr. Getting Paid More Than 80 Hrs. in Pay
                      Period
  
  
 A part-time physician may inappropriately get paid for more than 80 hours
 in a pay period.
  
 Problem 3:
 ----------
 There is a check in ETA that prevents part-time doctors from getting paid
 more than 80 hours in a pay period. This check is based on the count of
 hours worked in the week.
  
 Patch PRS*4*102 implemented a new method to count hours in a week. Per
 the patch software requirements, unscheduled regular or overtime that is
 in excess of 8 hours in a day but less than 40 hours in a week should not
 be included in the counts of hours in the week and pay period.
    
 However, part-time doctors are not entitled to receive DA/DE (Hours Excess
 8) and hours in excess of 8 are reported on the 8B as UN/US. Since patch
 PRS*4*102 did not include these hours in the pay period count, it is
 possible that the sum of normal hours and UN/US could exceed 80 hours in
 the pay period for a part-time doctor.
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
 This patch modifies the software to count hours in excess of 8 per day in
 the week and pay period counts when the employee is not entitled to DA/DE
 (Hours Excess 8). This will prevent part-time doctors from getting paid
 for more than 80 hours in a pay period.
  
  
 4. ADD NEW 80 HOUR CAP FOR INTERMITTENT PHYSICIANS
  
 While researching the cap for PT Physicians, Payroll Policy determined
 that a similar cap should be in place for Intermittent Physicians who
 don't work Daily tours.
  
 E-Payroll provided the details for this cap in CR-003 and the software was
 updated to identify these employees and to cap their hours for the pay
 period at 80. The cap is for Intermittent Physicians with Pay Plan L and
 Normal Hours equal to zero. The sum of Unscheduled Regular (UN/US) will 
 be capped at 80 hours for the pay period.
