  This patch was developed to handle just-in-case items, or On-Demand Items
  (ODI), and the tracking of these items in the Generic Inventory Package
  (GIP) module.  ODIs may exist in the primary and secondary inventory 
  points, but not in the Warehouse inventory point.  This patch enhances 
  the GIP module to identify and track ODIs, and modifies related inventory
  reports so the ODI status is displayed.   
  
  A new option, On-Demand Users Enter/Edit [PRCP ON-DEMAND USERS], will  
  provide the IFCAP Application Coordinator with the ability to assign
  Inventory Managers the privilege of applying or changing the On-Demand
  setting of an item in a specific inventory point.  This new option, will
  require the user to hold the new security key, PRCPODI.
  
  Only assign the new security key, PRCPODI, to individuals specifically
  designated by the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Chief
  Logistics Officer and the IFCAP Application Coordinator for Logistics
  Operations. 
  
  
  NOTE:   Assigning this key incorrectly may result in inappropriate use.
  
  
  The DUZ, the unique identification (ID) for the Inventory Manager
  designated the privilege of modifying the On-Demand setting, will be
  stored in a new multiple for the assigned inventory point.  The DUZ
  allows the system to recognize the Inventory Managers permitted to
  maintain the On-Demand flag for an inventory point.  Only a limited
  number of Inventory Managers will have the privilege of maintaining the
  On-Demand flag for any given inventory point.
  
  Any changes to the On-Demand setting will result in the creation of an
  audit record containing related change information for the date and time,
  the user, the reason, and the new setting.
  
  The audit file will be subject to purging by the [PRCP PURGE AUTOMATIC
  RUN] option.  The purge will consider anything that is older than the
  purge interval (currently 13 months); however, the three most recent
  audit records will be retained.  Please note, in order for an inventory
  point to be included in this purge, the AUTOMATIC PURGE (#7.9) field must
  be set to 'Y' (YES) by the Inventory Manager.  
  
  Report Modifications:
  --------------------
  Several reports will also be updated to address problems with performance
  measures and tracking of inventory.  Some reports will be modified to
  identify ODIs; while other modifications will correlate and display
  information associated with ODIs from data associated to standard items.
   
  The count of items displayed on the Inventory Control Parameters Print 
  [PRCP INV CONTROL PARAM PRINT] was previously pulled from the zero node
  of the item multiple.  With the installation of this patch, the value
  displayed for the count will be determined by stepping through the
  multiple.
  
  The long supply information on the Stock Status Report [PRCP STOCK 
  STATUS REPORT] has been modified to cover a 90 day period instead of a 
  270 day period.  This change impacts all inventory points, including the 
  Warehouse.
  
  Two new reports, On-Demand Audit Activity Report [PRCP ON-DEMAND AUDIT
  REPORT] and On-Demand Conflicts Report [PRCP ON-DEMAND CONFLICT REPORT],
  will also be added.
   
  CLRS Adjustments:
  ----------------
  Due to the report modifications in the GIP module, adjustments were 
  needed in the Clinical Logistics Report Server (CLRS).  These changes
  include altering the length of the strings being sent and restructuring
  the files transmitted to accommodate additional data.
  
  Two new parameter definitions associated transferring data to the CLRS 
  are being added.  One parameter will hold the Domain Name Server or
  Internet Protocol (IP) address belonging to the CLRS.  The other will
  hold the name of the new Microsoft (MS) Outlook mail group which will
  receive all messages concerning transaction activity.  This MS Outlook
  mail group is primarily for interested staff external to your site and
  will not impact the messages currently sent to site staff.  Both
  parameters will be populated automatically through a post-install program
  run as part of the patch installation.
  
  The MailMan messages that report errors when VistA populates the CLRS
  REPORT STORAGE (#446.7) File have been updated to capture and display
  other values present at the time of the error.  The captured data will be
  displayed within the text of the message and is intended to assist in the
  diagnosis of why the error was encountered.
  
  Label Revision:
  --------------
  This patch also revises the PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL stored in the Custom
  Label (#446.5) File.  When the patch is first installed, the software
  will automatically re-name the PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL to PRE-ODI
  PRIM/SECONDARY LABEL if the PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL is resident on your
  system and the PRE-ODI PRIM/SECONDARY LABEL does not yet exist.  The 
  patch will then install the new version of the PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL,
  which includes the On-Demand designation.
  
   
  Documentation Updates:
  ----------------------
  
  Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via File Transfer Protocol 
  (FTP) (using Binary (BIN) mode).  The preferred method is to FTP the 
  files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
  also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory via a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines:              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City:     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

  1.  Install File Print Verification 
      -------------------------------
      Verify the following messages appear in the Install File Print:
  
        Running Pre-Install Routine: BARCODE^PRC5198P
        CUSTOM LABEL, PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL RENAMED TO PRE-ODI
        PRIM/SECONDARY LABEL.
        PRE-INSTALL COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
  
        Running Post-Install Routine: INIT^PRC5198P

   NOTE:  The PRIMARY/SECONDARY LABEL is renamed PRE-ODI PRIM/SECONDARY
          LABEL when the PRE-ODI PRIM/SECONDARY LABEL is not defined.  The

          first time the patch is installed.
  
   2.  Security Key Assignment
       -----------------------
       Assign the PRCPODI key to the IFCAP Application Coordinator for
       Logistics Operations and individuals specifically designated by  
       the VISN Chief Logistics Officer.  
  
   NOTE:  Assigning this security key to an unauthorized staff member may
          result in inappropriate use of the On-Demand option which could
          adversely impact inventory performance measures and the ability
          to manage inventory as needed.
  
    3.  Check the Run-times of Background Processes
        -------------------------------------------
         
   NOTE:  YOU MUST SEQUENCE background processes as listed.  Sequence 
          the jobs so one starts after the previous one completes.  ALL
          three jobs MUST COMPLETE prior to the start of the business day.
  
        In order to transmit accurate data to the CLRS, it is necessary
        that no user is in GIP while the background processes are running,
        EACH process completes before beginning another process, and
        the processes are executed in the sequence LISTED BELOW.
         
      a.  Automatically Set Inventory Open Balances [PRCP OPEN BALANCES
          TASKMAN SET]  
  
          [PRCP OPEN BALANCES TASKMAN SET] must be scheduled to run 
          before the CLO GIP Reports (CLRS) [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION] 
          and CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT].
          You MUST start this process as close to midnight as possible.
  
      b.  CLO GIP Reports (CLRS) [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION]
  
          Schedule this processed to start two to three hours after
          Automatically Set Inventory Open Balances [PRCP OPEN
          BALANCES TASKMAN SET], item 3a, is scheduled.
                     
      c.  CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT]
  
          Schedule this process at least one hour after CLO GIP Reports
          (CLRS) [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION], item 3b, is started.  Be sure 
          to allow enough time for this process to complete before the
          start of the business day.
