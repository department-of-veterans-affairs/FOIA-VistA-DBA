Description: 
============

 At the end of this installation, a post install routine will clean up the

 message with the following subject line "BCMA Missing Dose Cleanup has

 1. Problem: The error message "Error(s) Filing Transaction MEDPASS" displays
    when the infusion rate for an IV Piggyback order includes more than 30 
    characters.
    
    Correction: The INFUSION RATE field (#.35) of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG
    file (#53.79) was increased from 30 to 47 characters.
   
 2. Problem: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option
    is creating incomplete entries in the MISSING DOSE REQUEST
    file (#53.68), when the user enters a "@" in the "Patient Name:" prompt.
 
    Correction: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option
    has been modified to not create an entry in the MISSING DOSE REQUEST
    file (#53.68) file, when a user enters a "@" in the "Patient Name:" 
    prompt.
