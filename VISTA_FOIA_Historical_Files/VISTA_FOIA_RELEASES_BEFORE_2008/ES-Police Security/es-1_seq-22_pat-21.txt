Subject: CLEAN UP NOIS ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

   This patch to POLICE & SECURITY v1.0 addresses issues reported in several
   NOIS entries.
   
   The following Police & Security options are affected:
   
   Edit a Completed Offense Report    [ESP EDIT OFFENSE REPORT]
   Edit Offense Report                [ESP EDIT OWN OFFENSE REPORT]
   Print Any Offense Report           [ESP PRINT ANY OR]
   Print Offense Report               [ESP PRINT OFFENSE REPORT]
   Quick Name Check                   [ESP QUICK NAME]
   
   (1) If there were incomplete offense reports associated with an officer
       who was no longer in Police & Security Service, these reports could
       not be completed and closed.  After installation of this patch, it
       will be possible for holders of the ESP CHIEF security key to mark
       these offense reports as completed using the Edit a Completed Offense
       Report option.  These offense reports may then be closed and 
       possibly reopened under a new UOR#.  The needed changes were made
       to routine ESPOFFE.
       (NOIS reference: CIN-0597-40372, FRE-1297-60506.)
   
   (2) When using the Print Any Offense Report or the Print Offense Report
       options, there were problems with incorrect form feed control.  This
       was particularly noticeable when the offense report narrative was
       printing.  Routine ESPORP5 has been revised to correct the problem.  
       (NOIS reference: MAD-0797-40638.)
   
   (3) A couple of problems existed in the routine ESPQNC which is used in
       the Quick Name Check option.  These problems caused undefined errors
       to occur during display of the information.
       (NOIS reference: DAY-0597-41455, HIN-0198-41922, MAD-0298-41619,
                        MIA-0298-32319.)
   
   (4) The data definition for the CATEGORY field (#.04) in the ESP MASTER 
       NAME INDEX file (#910) has been revised.  This field is defined as a
       set of codes, where the code 'O' was defined as 'OUTSIDER'.  The code
       'O' will now stand for 'OTHER', which is consistent with the package
       design.
       (NOIS reference: MEM-0697-71350.)

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*21):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*21.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       Edit a Completed Offense Report    [ESP EDIT OFFENSE REPORT]
       Edit Offense Report                [ESP EDIT OWN OFFENSE REPORT]
       Print Any Offense Report           [ESP PRINT ANY OR]
       Print Offense Report               [ESP PRINT OFFENSE REPORT]
       Quick Name Check                   [ESP QUICK NAME]        
   
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
