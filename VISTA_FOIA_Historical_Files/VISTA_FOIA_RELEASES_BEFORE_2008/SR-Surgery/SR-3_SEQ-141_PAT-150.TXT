           ENHANCEMENT

Description:
===========
 
The patch corrects the following errors:
 
 1.  When changing the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) of the Surgery
     File (#130) using the SURGEON'S VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS &
     PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, or the UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
     CODES [SRCODING EDIT] option, the system will offer the user the
     option to delete any associations to diagnosis codes.  If the user
     answers "yes" to delete the diagnosis associations, the system will
     display two question marks "??", and prompt the user to enter the CPT
     code again.  If the user presses the return key to respond "no", the
     system will display a zero "0" character in error.
 
 2.  When changing the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) of the Surgery
     File (#130) using the SURGEON'S VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS &
     PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, the system will prompt for the diagnosis
     code(s) to associate to the CPT code.  The screen will display the
     CPT code that existed prior to the change, rather than the new CPT
     code the user entered.
 
 3.  When deleting the PRINCIPAL POST-OP DIAG field (#34) of the Surgery
     File (#130) using the SURGEON'S VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS &
     PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, or the UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
     CODES [SRCODING EDIT] option, the system will retain the association
     to the principal CPT code, and will display a blank associated 
     diagnosis.
 
 4.  When associating a Diagnosis Code to a CPT code using the SURGEON'S
     VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS & PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, or the
     UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES [SRCODING EDIT] option, the
     system will prompt for the diagnosis code to associate to the CPT
     code. If the user enters "^^", the system will cause an error.
 
 5.  When associating a Diagnosis Code to a CPT code using the SURGEON'S
     VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS & PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, or the
     UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES [SRCODING EDIT] option, the
     system will error if the user enters a 0 (zero) when prompted to
     select the diagnosis code to associate.  Additionally, if there is
     only one diagnosis code to associate, and the user enters a 2, the
     system will error.
 
 6.  When associating a Diagnosis Code to the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE
     field (#27) of the Surgery File (#130) or when associating a
     Diagnosis Code to the OTHER PROCEDURE CPT CODE field (#3) of the
     OTHER PROCEDURES subfile (#130.16) using the SURGEON'S 
     VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS & PROCEDURES [SROVER] option, or the
     UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES [SRCODING EDIT] option,
     the system may generate an error if the user selects a range of
     Diagnosis to associate, e.g. "1-4". 
 
 7.  In the SURGEON'S VERIFICATION OF DIAGNOSIS & PROCEDURES [SROVER]
     option, or the UPDATE/VERIFY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES [SRCODING
     EDIT] option, the display of Other Diagnosis Codes free text, which
     do not have a corresponding ICD Diagnosis Code, may include "^^"
     after the diagnosis text.
 
 8.  The Anesthesia Start and End time fields do not allow the entry
     of time values prior to the TIME PAT IN HOLD AREA field.
 
 9.  When entering anesthesia time, if a user answers the question
     "Does this entry complete all start and end times for this
     case?" with "NO", then subsequently enters the same value for
     the anesthesia end time and then answers the question with 
     "YES", an Anesthesia Report stub may not be created. 
 
 10. The display of fields in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS [SROPARAM]
     option are numbered incorrectly.
 
 11. When creating a new Surgery Site, the UPDATES TO PCE and ASK
     CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS fields are not being set to "YES" as a
     default.
 
 12. An enhancement has been made to the list of environmental indicators
     displayed when prompting the user for the patient classification. The
     system will now display the patient's enrollment for Head and Neck
     Cancer, as well as Military Sexual Trauma.
 
 13. An enhancement has been made to the editing of classification
     questions when creating or editing a Surgery case. The software now
     allows a user to "^" out of the classification prompt.
