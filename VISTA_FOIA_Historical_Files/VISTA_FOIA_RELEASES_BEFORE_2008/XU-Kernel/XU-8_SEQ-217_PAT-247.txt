 This patch XU*8.0*247 deals with several NOIS':
  
 1) This patch removes the message "USER has no ACCESS CODE", which 
    appeared in the "Edit an Existing User" Screen of the XUREACT USER
    Form when a user selected the option: REACTIVATE A USER [XUSERREACT] 
    with a person having an access code. This problem has been reported
    in the NOIS HIN-0302-42781.
  
 2) The field DOB (#5) of New Person file (#200) is added on the 
    "Edit an Existing User" Screen of the XUEXISTING USER form.
    The NOIS CLE-0702-42043 requested this enhancement.
  
 3) This patch also deletes the "AF" cross-ref of New Person file #200
    for accounts that may have installed XU*8.0*138 entered as error.
    This problem has been reported in the NOIS ISD-0101-70398.
