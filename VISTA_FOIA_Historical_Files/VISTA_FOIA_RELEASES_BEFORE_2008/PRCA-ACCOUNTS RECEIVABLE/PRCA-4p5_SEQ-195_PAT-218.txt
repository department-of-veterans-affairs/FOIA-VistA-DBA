 Project Overview:
 -----------------
  
 HEC VistA Enhancements (HVE) provides software to support several 
 critical business processes associated with congressionally mandated 
 initiatives. Through the course of a three phase roll-out, a series of
 system application updates have been an d are being made to support
 enhanced Enrollment functionality, both within VistA and the Health 
 Eligibility Center (HEC), and updates to a series of veterans' 
 enrollments, including continuous enrollment, and eligibilities, 
 including statuses of Combat Veteran, former Prisoner of War (POW), 
 Unemployable Veteran and Filipino Veteran. The patch incorporated into 
 this release is part of the HVE Phase 3 project. 
  
 The HVE Phase 3 project functionality enhancements include:
  
 - Unemployable Veteran Service Connection (SC) Priority Group Change;
 - POW Veteran Pharmacy Copayment Exemption and Dental Treatment;
 - Filipino Veteran Data Sharing with the HEC;
 - Combat Veteran (Phase III) Enrollment Priority Updates and Data Sharing
 with the HEC;
 - Military Service Date (MSD) Sharing with the HEC; and, 
 - Continuous Enrollment Priority Updates. 
  
 The HVE Phase 3 functionality will be introduced at all sites as part of 
 a combined effort that encompasses updates to: 
  
 - Registration (Patch DG*5.3*564); IVM (IVM*2.0*97); Scheduling
 (SD*2.0*395) (Distributed as Host File DG_53_P564.KID);
 - Integrated Billing (Patch IB*2.0*275); and, 
 - Accounts Receivable (Patch PRCA*4.5*218). 
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 The patch PRCA*4.5*218 provides the following modifications:
  
 Combat Veteran (CV) Status will be displayed in the header of the Account 
 Profile Screen [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE]. 
  
 The CV Status will be displayed in the line following the Rx Copay Status 
 line.
  
 The CV Status line will be displayed only if the AR Debtor is a patient.
  
 Depending on the patient's CV Status the Account Profile Screen will 
 display one of the following values:
  
      CV Status: YES   - the patient is Combat Vet for the current date
      CV Status: No    - the patient is not Combat Vet for the current date
  
 If the CV Status End Date is available for the veteran, the Account
 Profile Screen will also indicate that date, e.g:
  
      CV Status Ends: 01/01/2005
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
  
 The patch modifies one AR routine: PRCAAPR1. This routine generated the 
 AR Accounts Profile screen. The change was done to print the Combat Vet 
 status in the next line from the Rx Copay Status line.
  
 In order to determine the patient's CV Status, the procedure will call 
 the DG API $$CVEDT^DGCV(), implemented by the patch DG*5.3*528. Therefore 
 the patch DG*5.3*528 is indicated as required build.
  
  
 Install Time - less than 1 minute.
