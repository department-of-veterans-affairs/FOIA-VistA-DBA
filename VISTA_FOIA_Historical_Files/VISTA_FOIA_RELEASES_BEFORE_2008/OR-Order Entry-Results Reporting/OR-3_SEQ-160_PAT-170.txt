Subject: NOTIFICATION PARAMETER ALLOCATION ERRORS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses an allocation error that can occur with notification

 values in routine ORB3FN.  Previously, the parameter values were loaded 
 into a local array.  They are now loaded into ^TMP("ORBP",$J.  For 
 additional information, refer to the following NOIS calls:
