Description: 
============

 Developed in DEV,VOO
  
 OVERVIEW:
 =========
 This patch is being released as an added enhancement to the Enrollment 
 Sub-priorities project (ESP) that was released in DG*5.3*491.
  
 When the EGT is set shortly after the installation of the ESP patches, 
 DG*5.3*491 and IVMB*2*729, all priority 8 veterans that were not enrolled 
 before 1/17/03 will have their enrollment status changed to REJECTED, 
 BELOW ENROLLMENT GROUP THRESHOLD.  A request has been made for the 
 ability to see some indicator that the veteran's enrollment has been 
 rejected and is therefore not eligible for care.  A message displays in 
 the patient lookup but in many cases it scrolls off the screen before the 
 user sees it.  This patch provides another indicator with an automatic 
 update to the Remarks field #.091 of the Patient file #2 with the message 
 **REJECTED** if the veteran has a Rejected enrollment status.  This 
 message will display in the Patient Inquiry and Registration options.  If 
 the veteran's enrollment status changes and is no longer Rejected, the 
 **REJECTED** message will automatically be removed from the Remarks field.
  
 It is important that this patch be installed before the setting of the 
 EGT in order to insure the proper updating of the Remarks field with the 
 **REJECTED** message.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 PATIENT ENROLLMENT (File #27.11)
 Field #.04     ENROLLMENT STATUS - a new cross-reference was added:
  
     AC^MUMPS 
     1)= D SETREM^DGENDD(DA,X)
     2)= D SETREM^DGENDD(DA,X)
  
     This cross-reference calls an API that will
     update the Remarks field #.091 of the Patient
     file #2 depending on the value of the
     enrollment status.  If the enrollment status
     contains the word REJECTED, then the Remarks 
     field will be updated with the message
     **REJECTED**.  If the enrollment status is not
     a Rejected status then the message **REJECTED**
     will be removed from the Remarks field.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section is mapped, it should be removed from
    the mapped set at this time.
  
 2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch

       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
           NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
           will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
           the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
           patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
           in the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.

  7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
  
  8.  If a routine was unmapped as part of step 1, it should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.

Routine Information:

 The tag SETREM was added.  This tag is called from the "AC"
