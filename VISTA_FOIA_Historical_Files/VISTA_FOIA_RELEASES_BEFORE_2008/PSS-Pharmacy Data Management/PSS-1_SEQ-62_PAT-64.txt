Description: 
============

 During the testing of the fractional dose functionality in Bar Code 
 Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 Phase I, there was a problem
 reported with the units per dose calculated in Inpatient Medications V. 
 5.0 where the units per dose having more than two decimal places were
 being passed to BCMA.  The problem was with Inpatient Medications V. 5.0
 not rounding the units per dose to two decimal places.  In trying to fix
 this problem, an additional problem was found in the Pharmacy Data
 Management (PDM) V. 1.0 routine that returns dosage information. After
 reviewing the Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and the Pharmacy Data
 Management V. 1.0 packages, it was found that there was an inconsistency
 in the number of decimal places allowed when the units per dose were
 calculated. Inpatient Medications V. 5. 0 will be changed to allow four
 decimal places to match what PDM allows when creating possible dosages in
 the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option. NOIS# ISB-0203-31214.
