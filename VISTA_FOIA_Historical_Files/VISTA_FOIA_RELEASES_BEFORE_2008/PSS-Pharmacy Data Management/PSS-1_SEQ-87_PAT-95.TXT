Category:

       for the TO SERVICE field in option [PSJ AC Setup]

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =====================
  
       Problem:
       --------
       This problem arose during the SQA testing of the Inpatient Meds
       patch PSJ*5.0*126.  When the SQA analyst entered ? or ?? to use
       the lookup/help functionality for the TO SERVICE prompt of the
       AUto-Discontinue Set-Up [PSJ AC SETUP] menu option, an undefined 
       variable error occurred.  This error prevented the SQA analyst
       from further testing CLE-0604-40092.
  
       Resolution:
       -----------
       
       This patch corrects the line of code causing the error so
       that the ? and ?? lookups for the TO SERVICE field will
       work properly.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
       Routine PSSDDUT2 has been modified to prevent an undefined
       variable error from occurring when the ? and ?? lookups for
       the TO SERVICE field are invoked.
