Subject: EDIT VERIFIED INVOICES, NEW DRUGS INDEXES & MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problems:
   
 1.   HD68490   Editing Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE]
 Saying 'NO" to processing the edit changes made for DISPENSE UNITS field 
 (#14.5) and/or DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field (#15) of the Drug file 
 (#50), does not restore those fields to their previous values.
  
 2.   HD68779   Editing Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE]
 A drug that is newly picked and added newly to a pharmacy location in the 
 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8) has several of it's indexes 
 scrambled and the users are not able to select the drug within that 
 pharmacy location for any further processing purposes. A post init 
 routine will scan and clean up bad indexes it finds.
  
 3.   HD100058 Drug Balances by Location [PSA DISPLAY LOCATION]
 The report menu "Drug Balances by Location" show entries for inactive 
 drugs that have a zero quantity. Those items are now not to be shown.
  
 4.   HD108683 Verify Invoices [PSA VERIFY INVOICES]
 Drugs that are new to a pharmacy location in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
 STATS file (#58.8) may need more data such as current balance, stock 
 level, and reorder levels entered to complete their setup for processing. 
 A separate, individual mail message is currently sent regarding each
 drug that is newly added. The volume of messages is overwhelming. A single
 consolidated mail message by invoice regarding drugs that are newly added
 is needed to replace the individual mail messages. The mail messages will
 no longer be sent to holders of the PSAMGR and PSDMGR keys, but will now 
 be sent only to the mail group G.PSA NDC UPDATES.

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ====================
 1.     HD68490
 Editing Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE]
 Problem:
 -------- 
 Saying 'NO" to processing the edit changes made for Dispense Unit and 
 Dispense Units per Order Unit does not restore those fields to their 
 previous values.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------  
 The before values are now saved and restored if the user replies 'NO' to 
 the prompt:
 Are you sure about this ?  NO//
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ========== 
  
 PSAVERA has been modified to store and restore the pre edit values for 
 the DISPENSE UNITS field (#14.5) and DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field 
 (#15) of the Drug file (#50) when needed. 
  
 2.      HD68779   Editing Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE]
 Problem:
 ======== 
 A drug that is newly picked and added newly to the pharmacy location has 
 several of it's indexes scrambled and the users are not able to select 
 the drug within that pharmacy location for any further processing 
 purposes. A post init routine will scan and clean up bad indexes it finds.
   
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The proper variable is now being set that will setup the indexes in the 
 proper manner. A post-init routine will locate the bad indexes that have 
 been built and correct them.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 PSAVERA has been modified to properly set the variable X when adding a 
 new drug to a pharmacy location. The variable X had been containing a 
 FileMan date value which was being used to populate the indexes. PSAV3P53 
 is the post-init routine that will correct the bad indexes by locating 
 the ^PSD(58.8,"C",xxx entries where xxx is of the form for a FileMan date 
 and then build proper indexes for the entries and then remove the bad 
 indexes. PSAV3P53 is the post init routine.
  
 3.      HD100058 Drug Balances by Location [PSA DISPLAY LOCATION]
 Problem:
 ======== 
 The  Drug Balances by Location report show entries for inactive drugs 
 that have a zero quantity. Those items are now not to be shown.
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The report now ignores drugs that are inactive and have a zero quantity.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 The routine PSADAI has been appropriately modified.
  
 4.      HD108683 Verify Invoices [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] 
 Problem:
 ======== 
 Drugs that are new to a pharmacy location in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
 STATS file (#58.8) are needing more data entered to complete their being 
 setup for processing. Such items as current balance, stock level, and 
 reorder levels are needed. A separate, individual mail message is 
 currently sent regarding each drug that is newly added. The volume is 
 overwhelming.
  
 Single consolidated mail message by invoice regarding drugs that are 
 newly added is needed to replace the individual mail messages.
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The routine PSAVER6 has been modified to consolidate the drugs into one 
 report.
