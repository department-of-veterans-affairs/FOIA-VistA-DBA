                       XT*7.3*98 VistA Patch Monitor.
  
 Important Note:
 ===============
  
 NOTE: This is Kernel Toolkit Patch XT*7.3*98. It exports the VistA Patch 
 Monitor software. The VistA Patch Monitor is not to be confused with the 
 VistA Auto Patch (VAPU) Monitor. This patch includes a post init routine 
 XT73P98, which deletes all Class III VistA Patch Monitor Version 2.0 
 files (i.e., Files PATCH MONITOR (#177100.6) and PATCH MONITOR 
 PARAMETER (#177100.7)), options and routines in the AWB namespace. Patch
 XT*7.3*98 exports and installs all options and files comprising the Class
 I version of the VistA Patch Monitor in the XTPM namespace.
                  ===========================
  
 The VistA Patch Monitor software is a package designed to assist package
 support and management personnel in keeping up with VistA patch
 requirements.  It monitors patches as they arrive in the VistA MailMan,
 records pertinent data and then monitors the patches on a daily basis
 through automated processing. This package will track only patches that
 are released from the National Patch Module on Forum.  It will not track
 Class III patches, test patches or hand-entered patches from other sources
 due to its link with the KIDs INSTALL file.
  
 Package support and management personnel have a various reporting 
 programs they may use on a daily basis as well as automatic daily options 
 which report anything from any patches that are past due to patches which 
 report uninstalled patches.
  
 Further information is provided in a separate document named "VistA Patch 
 Monitor, Patch XT*7.3*98, Supplement to Patch Desc." This document can be 
 downloaded from the Health Systems Design and Development (HSD&D) VistA 
 Documentation Library (VDL) Web site:
 http://www.va.gov/vdl/Infrastructure.asp?appID=12

 Enterprise VistA Support (EVS) anonymous directories:

 Note: This method transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 Package Operation:
 =================== 
 Patches are usually sent to the G.PATCHES mail group, which should be 
 standard at all sites.  If this mail group does not exist at a site, any 
 mail group that receives national patches may be used.  
  
 In this mail group, a server option, S.XTPM PATCH SERVER, is added as a 
 "remote user."  When Mailman delivers the message, the server option 
 receives the message, examines it line by line and extracts certain 
 information.  This message data then is stored in the PATCH MONITOR file 
 (#9.9).
  
 Upon arrival, a patch message is examined to see if it contains the text 
 "**INSTALL NAME**" as a line in the message.  If it does not, then the 
 message is flagged as "non-KIDs" when first entered.  This does not mean 
 it is not really a KIDs patch but rather that there is no KIDs install 
 included in the patch message.  This may be because of one of the 
 following two things:
  1. The patch may require a host file to be downloaded and installed  
     into the distribution global
  2. The patch may not yet be loaded into the distribution global from
     the MailMan message
  
 At night, a TaskMan option, XTPM NIGHTLY PATCH MONITOR, runs after 
 midnight, reviews the PATCH MONITOR file (#9.9) and takes certain actions:
  1. If any patch is not installed and the current date is not past 
     the compliance date, nothing is done. 
  2. If the job finds a matching entry in the INSTALL file (#9.7), the 
     patch type is set to be a "KIDs" patch.  Otherwise it continues to
     remain a non-KIDs patch until such a record is found.
  3. If the patch is a KIDs patch and there is no installation date in 
     the INSTALL file (#9.7) and the current date is past the compliance
     date, it is added to the mail bulletin that reports all past due
     patches to the XTPM PATCH MONITOR mail group.
  4. If the patch is a non-KIDs patch and there is no completion date 
     in the PATCH MONITOR file (#9.9) and the current date is past the 
     compliance date, it also is added to the mail bulletin that reports
     all past due patches to the XTPM PATCH MONITOR mail group.
  5. Any patch record, whether KIDs or non-KIDs, that has either a
     completed installation record or a completion date, respectively, will
     be purged from the PATCH MONITOR file (#9.9) if it is so designated in
     the PATCH MONITOR PARAMETER file (#9.95).

 If your site has previously installed the VistA Patch Monitor Class III 
 software, the following steps must be taken into consideration before 
 installing Patch XT*7.3*98.
  
 If the options listed below are installed at your site, use VA TaskMan to 
 unschedule them:
