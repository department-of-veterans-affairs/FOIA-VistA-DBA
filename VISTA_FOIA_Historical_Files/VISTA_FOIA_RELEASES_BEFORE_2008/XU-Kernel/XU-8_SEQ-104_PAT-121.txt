Subject: %ZOSVKSD Routine Needed for SAGG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticipation
 of a future patch for the Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG)
 Version 1.8 software package.  A future SAGG patch will enable the
 collection of disk capacity information from the sites.
  
 This patch distrbution will be adding a new %ZOSVK* routine to the
 system-specific manager routine set.  The accompanying installation
 instructions will guide you in adding these routines to your system.
  
 This distribution also contains the ZTMGRSET routine which will save the
 new routine under the correct name.

 Installation:
 ============
  
   1.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped, so you will
        need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
        
   2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
        
   3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
        
    4.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  (If you install when few
        users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors
        is accecptable, then users can stay on the system.)  
        
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
        
           Install Package(s)   'XU*8.0*121'
                                 ==========
        
        No options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        
           Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
           and Protocols? NO
                          ==
        
    6.  OpenM sites - you do not need to move any routines, skip this step.
        
        DSM and MSM sites - you need to move several routines from your
        production account to each manager account.
        
           ZOSVKSD
           ZTMGRSET
        
    7.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
        All sites:
        
           DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
           Select the System
           Patch number to load: 121
                                 ===
    8.  DSM sites - after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
        
    9.  Enable user logins.
