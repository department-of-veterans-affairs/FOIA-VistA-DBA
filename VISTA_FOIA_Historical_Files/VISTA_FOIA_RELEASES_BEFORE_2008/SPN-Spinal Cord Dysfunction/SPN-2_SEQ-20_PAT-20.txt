Subject: AGGREGATE OUTCOMES REPORTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch will enhance the Outcomes module of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction
 (SCD) package.  Users will be able to produce an aggregate (group) 
 outcomes report for inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation, over a 
 user-specified date range.  The report will provide a statistical summary 
 of unique patient outcomes in five diagnostic categories: Hi Tetra, Lo 
 Tetra, Para, ASIA D, and ALL.  Aggregate outcomes reports for annual 
 evaluation and continuum of care will be provided in a subsequent patch.
  
 Additional enhancements contained in this patch are:
  
         1. Code has been written to support the creation of 16 different 
 TIU objects, so sites may facilitate the automatic updating of such Vista
 components as TIU progress notes.  The  code is contained in routines
 SPNOBJ and SPNETOBJ.  It is important to note that this patch does not 
 provide the TIU objects per se, but rather the code to support the
 creation of the TIU objects.
  
         2. The SCORE TYPE field (#.021) in the OUTCOMES file (#154.1) has
 been expanded to accomodate five new score types, CC ADMIT, CC GOAL, 
 CC INTERIM, CC DISCHARGE, and CC OUTPT.  These will apply to Continuum of
 Care outcomes only.  A new file, OUTCOME SCORE TYPES (#154.3) has been
 created for this purpose.
  
         3. The computed field LENGTH OF REHAB IN DAYS (#999.08) in the 
 OUTCOMES file (#154.1) will be sent to the centralized database at 
 the Austin Automation Center (AAC).
  
         4. Field DAYS OF INTERRUPTED CARE (#1004) in the OUTCOMES file 
 (#154.1) will be restricted such that the user's input cannot exceed the
 difference between Record Date of the FIM Rehab Finish record and Care 
 Start Date.
  
         5. Computed field LENGTH OF REHAB IN DAYS (#999.08) in the 
 OUTCOMES file (#154.1) has been placed in the FIM and Comprehensive Ad Hoc
 Report Generators, as a sort field and print field.
  
  
 This patch also addresses the following NOIS calls:
  
 NOIS Calls.
 ===========
  
 1) NOIS # SDC-0303-60225.  DATE OF DEATH field (999.09) is missing from 
 the Self Report of Function Ad Hoc report generator.  This has been fixed.
  
 2) NOIS # SDC-0303-60227.  In option Change your Division Assignment [SPNL
 USER DIVISION], the word "divison" is misspelled.  This has been
 corrected.
  
 3) NOIS # SDC-0303-60230.  The ability to add new Outcome records was 
 allowed even if the patient did not exist in the SCD (SPINAL CORD)
 REGISTRY file (#154) .  This has been fixed.
  
 4) NOIS # PUG-0403-51590.  In option SPNL LAB UTIL SPECIFIC, there is a
 malfunction.  Users cannot "^" out.  This has been fixed.
  
 5) NOIS # SDC-0403-61589.  In the SCD FILTER file (#154.92), the entry
 "DIAGNOSIS" is not consistent with the use of "Etiology" elsewhere in the 
 SCD Registry.  For purposes of uniformity, the name of filter "DIAGNOSIS" 
 has been changed to "ETIOLOGY".
  
 6) NOIS # PUG-0503-50621.  Option SPNL INPT/OPT ACTIVITY is a report 
 option which erroneously includes inpatient appointments in the count of 
 outpatient statistics.  This has been fixed.

     General Information.
     ====================
  
    This patch should be installed into your production UCI.  It can be
    installed at anytime.  You may experience pauses during installation,
    but install time should not take more than ten minutes. No options need
    to be disabled.  An environment check will be performed to ensure that
    the installing site has installed SPN*2.0*18.
  
  
     Installation Instructions.
     ==========================
  
     Users of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction package may remain online during
     installation.
  
     This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:
  
       1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build
            onto your system.
       2) Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
            Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
            the mapped set at this time.
       3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option
            'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all
            routines have the correct checksums.
       4) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option 'Install
            Package(s)'.  Select the package 'SPN*2.0*20' and proceed with
            install.
       5) It is recommended that you answer 'NO' to each of the following
            questions:
            a) 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
                Install?'
            b) 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
            c) 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
                Protocols?'
       6) If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
            returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
            completion.
