 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE:
 =====================
 PSI-05-114
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 HD0000000116253 - Partial CPRS report
  
 Duplicates:  
 HD0000000130877 - Microscopic section missing in GUI TIU AP report
 HD0000000138514 - DX not viewable in surgical path report
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Boston HCS
 Cheyenne VAMC
 Long Beach HCS
  
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
   Problem:
   --------
   If a completed Surgical Pathology report is edited and the user does a
   <Control C> to exit the editor, the 0 node gets corrupted, resulting in
   incomplete data being sent from the LAB DATA file (#63) to the TIU
   DOCUMENT file (#8925). 
  
   Note:  The user's Preferred Editor must be set to Line Editor in order 
          to use <Control C>.
  
   Solution:
   ---------
   Modify routine LRAPBR1 to check for actual number of text lines and
   update the 0 node if necessary so that FileMan will extract the text
   and send it to TIU.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.

       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your

       Compare Transport Global to Current System
       Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*363'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
