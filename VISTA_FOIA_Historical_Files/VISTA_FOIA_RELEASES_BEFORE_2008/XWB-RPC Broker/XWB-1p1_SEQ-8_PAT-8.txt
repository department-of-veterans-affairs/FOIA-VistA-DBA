Description: 
============

 **  Y2K WAIVER - #Y2KW0001  **
  
 This patch supports GUI Multi-Divisional signon.  If a user has more
 than one division to choose from, the user must select one  before
 continuing with signon.  If the user has only one division in file 200,
 this division will be used; else, the default institution in the
 Kernel System Parameters file will be used.
  
 This patch specifically resolves problems reported in the following NOISs:
  EKH-1298-40440     Divisional Parameters
  EKH-0399-40543     WHEN ENTERING THROUGH THE GUI the submit request
  HVH-0699-12732     GUI ONLY USES PRIMARY SITE FIELDS: IC LAB ORDERS
  FGH-0299-32563     MultiDivisional Capabilities
  BHH-0799-41993     Lab Collection Printing Problem for Integrated Sites
  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTES: 
 =================
  
 This patch consists of 1 part ONLY: 
 - An updated Broker Development Kit (BDK), the programmer workstation
 software.  All sites doing Broker development are encouraged to retrieve
 the patched BDK. Note that this version of the BDK only supports Delphi 4
 and Delphi 3.  This patch doesn't support Delphi 5.
  
 DO NOT INSTALL THIS PROGRAMMER CLIENT WORKSTATION SOFTWARE ON END-USER
 CLIENT WORKSTATIONS.  If you are not using the BDK in any local or
 national development, you do not need to retrieve the Broker's programmer
 client workstation software.  The patch does not update the Broker
 software that is running at end-user client workstations.  
  
 The software distribution includes:

 BROKER-DEPENDENT COMPONENTS
 ===========================
  
 The following comments apply only to those developing applications with
 the BDK (programmer workstation software).  They are not relevant to
 server operation.
  
 WARNING:
 Some components, such as the FileMan Delphi Components, reference the
 TRPCBroker component.  If you use such components for development, be
 aware that installing a new version of the TRPCBroker component (i.e., a
 new BDK) may cause incompatibilities in Delphi, resulting in a compile
 failure of the unit containing the Broker-dependent component and the
 following compilation error:
   
         Unit <unit1> was compiled with a different version of <unit2>.
   
 Check with the creators of the Broker-dependent component to make sure
 that, with regards to the version of the BDK you are about to install:
   
 a) Your current component is compatible, or
   
 b) You can obtain a new version of the component that is compatible, or
  
 c) You have the source (.pas) files available so that the component can be
 recompiled successfully.
   
 For the FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC), patch FMDC*1.0*1 brings in a new
 version of the FMDC that includes the source files.  Please refer to the
 Patch Module for more information on this FMDC patch.  Additional
 instructions regarding installing and recompiling FMDC when the Broker is
 upgraded are in XWB1_1RM.TXT found in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories
 mentioned above and on the FMDC web page.
  
 CLIENT SIDE INSTALLATION:
