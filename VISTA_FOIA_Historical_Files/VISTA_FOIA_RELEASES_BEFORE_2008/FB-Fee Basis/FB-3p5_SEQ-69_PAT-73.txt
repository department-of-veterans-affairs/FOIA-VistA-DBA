Subject: ADJUST A PRESCRIPTION CHARGE AND X-REF FOR AUTH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ***************************** N O T E ***********************************
 CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with the 
 FB-CoreFLS development team.
 **************************************************************************
  
 This Patch addresses two issues: The first, Allow the sites to suspend 
 payment for a prescription that is not covered. The second, To correct 
 the "AF" X-ref by using FileMan call to populate the field AUTHORIZATION 
 POINTER of file #162.

 N/A
       
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ----------------
 1. SHR-0104-70997     Can't adjust a prescription charge.
 2. ISP-0104-N1553     x-ref for Authorization pointer of file #162 is not
                       updated.
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1. SHR-0104-70997     Can't adjust a prescription charge.
     
    Problem:
    -------
    Unable to suspend payment for a prescription that is not covered.  The 
    charge is $70.30.  When trying to suspend $70.30 the process is
    changing the amount to $70.3 causing the compare not to be true, thus
    creating an error message and disallowing the adjustment.
  
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify the code to plus the values allowing the truncated dollar amount
    to be equal to the non truncated amount. 70.3=70.30.
  
    
 2. ISP-0104-N1553     x-ref for Authorization pointer of file #162 is not
                       updated.
        
    Problem:
    -------
    We found that the X-ref  "AF" for the Authorization Pointer file #162 
    was    not always updated. This may cause data to be inaccurate in the 
    following reports:
    LTC Outpatient Active Authorizations Report
    LTC Outpatient Ending Authorization Report 
    LTC CNH Active Authorizations Report
    LTC CNH Ending Authorizations Report
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify GETSVDT^FBAACO5 to use FileMan call to populate the field 
    AUTHORIZATION POINTER of file #162. This means that "AF" x-ref is
    updated correctly. Also a post-install routine FBXIP73 and FBXIP73E
    will be run to re-index the "AF" cross-reference, for those payment
    entries made before this patch.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 ********************************* N O T E ********************************
 CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation this patch with the 
 FB-CoreFLS development team.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 Due to the post install routine, the patch should be installed
 during off hours. The post install routine re-indexes the FEE BASIS
 PAYMENT file "AF" cross-reference. The length of time is dependent on the
 number of entries in the file. Estimated install time, from 5 min to 2
 hours. In test 30,000 entries took 8 minutes.
                                   
   
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
   
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
   
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
   
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter FB*3.5*73):
       
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      FB*3.5*73.
  
       NOTE: If you are a CoreFLS test site you will be asked:   
             Do you have the corresponding update to the Fee-CoreFLS
             software that is associated with this patch? (Note: Entering
             "No  here will stop the installation of this patch)  Y/N//
   
       a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
           install? YES//', answer NO.
   
       b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
           Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer NO.
         
  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
   
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
  
  NOTE: The post-install and enviornment check routine will be deleted 
  automatically after the patch is installed.
