Subject: ADDING STAT/NOW MAIL PARAMETER

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description:
============

  1. PSI-05-051:  A priority status of ASAP is not easily seen by the 
     finishing pharmacist.  A STAT order is displayed as blinking and 
     highlighted, but a ASAP order does not have any special visual
     effects.  
  
     In order to avoid adding more special visual effects to the screen 
     this patch is designed to offer a Site Ward Parameter that will allow
     the site a choice of what orders are sent to the STAT NOW MAIL GROUP.
     The site can select STAT, ASAP, or NOW orders, or any combination of 
     the three for notification via the STAT NOW MAIL GROUP functionality.
  
     After patch is installed, there will be no changes in the way the 
     system behaves, and there will be no automatic changes to the 
     INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS (#59.6) file records with the exception of 
     the addition of one field described in the Data Dictionary Changes section.
  
     In order to utilize the features of this new field, the value may be 
     selected for the priorities / schedules for notifications to be sent 
     to the mail group defined in the STAT NOW MAIL GROUP field (#5). This 
     parameter may be empty / not defined, or it may be set via the following 
     option: INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS EDIT [PSJ IWP EDIT]. 
  
  2. Remedy Ticket #106018:  Stat IV orders are not highlighted and 
     flashing like Stat Unit Dose orders.  This patch adds the code
     required to make Stat IV orders highlighted and flash like Stat Unit
     Dose orders.
