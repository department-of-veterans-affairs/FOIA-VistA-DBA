Subject: CORRUPT DATA IN THE IV PORTION OF THE PHARMACY PATIENT FILE (55)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Corrupt data is being found in the IV portion of the Pharmacy Patient

 Problem:
 ========
  
 Corrupt data records are being created for IV's in Pharmacy Patient file
 (#55).  Monthly extract is getting an error because of these records.
  
 Solution:
 =========
  
 This patch will not correct the corrupt records.  It will bypass the 
 corrupt records when running the monthly extract.  A non Pharmacy 
 Benefits Management patch will address the corrupt records.
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 An environmental check routine will run and abort the installations if
 site is running version 4 of Pharmacy Benefits Management.
