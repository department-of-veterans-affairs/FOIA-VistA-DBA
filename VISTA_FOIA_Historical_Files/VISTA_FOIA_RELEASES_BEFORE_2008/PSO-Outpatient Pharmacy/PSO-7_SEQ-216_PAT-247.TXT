Subject: HIPAA/NCPDP - RX ACTIVITY LOG CHANGES AND OTHER UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
  
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.    
     
 This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0 application in the
 following areas: 
  
 1. When the DAW CODE was edited on a released Consolidated Mail Outpatient 
    Pharmacy (CMOP)  prescription it was not triggering an automatic claim 
    reversal/re-submit to the third party payer. This patch corrects the 
    problem. Editing the DAW CODE on a released CMOP prescription will work
    similar to editing a WINDOW prescription, it will reverse/re-submit a
    claim.
  
 2. The ECME Reject section of the prescription activity log was changed in
    the following ways: 
    
    2.1) The column header "Date/Time" was changed to "Date/Time Rcvd" because
         a new column is being created (see 2.3).
    2.2) "DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW" in the "Reject" column will now display as
         "DUR" for space saving purposes.
    2.3) A new column is being created called "Date/Time Resolved" on the
         right hand side to display the Date/Time the reject was resolved.
  
 3. The option Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST]
    is being changed to allow the user to print a label for window
    prescriptions after a reject is resolved. The label print prompt will only
    be available if the prescription is active and no label was printed for
    the fill for which the reject was resolved. The following prompts will be 
    presented to the user:
  
       Print Label? YES // YES
     
       Select LABEL DEVICE:
  
 4. When the user resolved a third party reject using the 'Override Reject'
    action from the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS 
    WORKLIST] option, the entry in the Prescription activity log 
    corresponding to this event was not displaying the NCPDP override codes
    entered by the user. Before this fix the comment displayed as 
    'Submitted to ECME:REJECT WORKLIST-E PAYABLE'. After this patch is
    installed the comment will be logged as 'Submitted to ECME:REJECT 
    WORKLIST-DUR OVERRIDE CODES(NN/AS/1B)-E PAYABLE', as an example.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov, 
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific
     server as follows: 
   
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
  
     FILE NAME                         DESCRIPTION
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     BPS_1_UM_R0806.PDF                ECME V. 1.0 User Manual

     Note: When downloading these files from the ftp server, set the file 
           format to binary mode.
   
 3. Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation Library
    (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, http://www.va.gov/vdl.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Considerations:
  
   1. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated by the BPS
      Nightly Background Job [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job
      to finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
   2. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
      transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
      complete the installation before the transmission starts.
   3. It is recommended that the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build be 
      installed or QUEUED to be installed during off-peak hours to avoid 
      disruptions.  Due to a conversion process performed by the IB*2*342 
      post-install routine, installation time can be quite extensive (taking
      an estimated one to four hours to complete) for those sites that have 
      been activated with the HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL software for more than one 
      month. For those sites that have not yet been activated with the HIPAA 
      NCPDP - GLOBAL software, the installation time will be less than 10 
      minutes.
  
 The conversion process mentioned above will not affect pharmacy and billing 
 operations, therefore, users can be on the system during the IB*2*342 
 post-installation process. However, it is recommended that the ECME 
 Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option be disabled 
 during installation as it may display irregular results if run during the 
 installation process (see item 11 in the installation steps).
  
  
 To Install the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build distribution:
  
 1.  Obtain the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the following
     three patch installs:
       
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, select the Load a Distribution option.
  
 4.  When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", enter the full directory path
     where you saved the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID (e.g., 
     SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID).
  
 5.  When prompted for "OK to continue with Load? NO//", enter "YES."
     
     The following will display:
  
       Loading Distribution...
  
         BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342

 6.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0")
  
     6.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     6.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     6.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 7. Back in the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option.
  
 8. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 
    1.0."
  
 9. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
    Yes//" for the BPS*1.0*3 build, respond "YES."  For the build IB*2.0*342, 
    respond "NO."
  
  
 10. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond "NO." 
  
 11. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//", enter "YES"
  
     11.1 When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          Enter the following options:
  
              ECME Billing Events Report  [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
  
     11.2 When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          press <RET>
  
 12. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device or 
     queue this to P-Message.
  
 13. For sites that have already activated ePharmacy functionality, there is a
     post-installation step, which is to check the BPS NCPDP Logical link. In
     most cases, the link will be running (STATE=ENABLED or INACTIVE). If this
     link is not running it will need to be restarted.  To turn on the logical
     link, run the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option located on the Filer and
     Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7
     Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK
     NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP", and when prompted for "Method for running the
     receiver", choose the default of B - Background to enable the logical link.
