Description:
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*259 contains changes to software 
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE. 
 Changes include: 
      Changes to the name formatting subroutine in ^LRUA
      Changes to the Electron Microscopy sub-file (#63.02)in the
        LAB DATA file (#63)
      Changes to the Surgical Pathology sub-file (#63.08)in the
        LAB DATA file (#63)
      Changes to the Cytopathology sub-file (#63.09)in the
        LAB DATA file (#63)
      The addition of the AP ESIG ON field (#619) to the
        LABORATORY SITE FILE (#69.9)
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS:   Changes made by patch LR*5.2*259 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Patch LR*5.2*259 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
 functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES:  This patch contains changes to one routine and 
 two files identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 
 99-053, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation 
 of this patch.
 
 VISTA Laboratory Anatomic Pathology Electronic Signature (Patch LR*5.2*259) 
 software release implements the new electronic signature functionality 
 within the Autopsy, Cytology, Electron Microscopy, and Surgical Pathology 
 sections for the Autopsy protocol, Standard Form 515 (SF 515), and 
 supplementary reports. This new electronic signature functionality can be 
 activated or inactivated at the discretion of the site. The new Turn 
 Electronic Signature On/Off [LRAP ESIG SWITCH] option is used to activate 
 or inactivate the new electronic signature functionality. Application of
 the electronic signature functionality occurs during the verification/release 
 process of the Autopsy and AP reports. 
 
 Pathologists may now view and electronically sign reports rather than 
 print a paper copy for viewing and signature. The electronic signature 
 name is obtained from the NEW PERSON file (#200), SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED 
 NAME field (#20.2). All electronically signed released reports are stored
 in the TIU Document file (#8925) which contains the electronic signature 
 name, date, and time displayed on the last page of the reports (near the
 bottom). Only authorized users are allowed to electronically sign reports. 
 Non-authorized users will receive a message indicating that they are not 
 authorized to electronically sign reports.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 
 This patch can be installed with users on the system.  However, it is 
 recommended that installation occur when there is no Anatomic Pathology
 activity or activity is at a minimum.  This will prevent 'Cannot return to 
 source routine' errors.  The Anatomic Pathology menu will be disabled 
 automatically by this patch and re-enabled after installation.
 
 The detailed instructions for installation and implementation of the 
 software are included in the Installation Instructions section of the 
 Install Guide.
