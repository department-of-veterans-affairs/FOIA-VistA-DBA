  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  
  1) UNY-0303-11769  C&P Records are getting requested on a regular Pull List
  
     Problem:
     ========
       UPSTATE NEW YORK HCS has several patients at their Batavia facility
       that are showing up as requiring the regular BA-MEDICAL RECORD on
       clinic pull lists, but several are also showing as requesting the
       BU-C&P Record, which is a location for Buffalo C&P Records.  The
       site checked the parameters and borrower setups and do not see any
       problem.
  
  
     Solution:
     =========
      Modified RTP3 routine that builds the Pull List report to exclude any
      records the Borrower does not have permissions for with the exception
      of the Administrative Folder. If the RECORD TYPE NEEDED is NULL all
      records requested will print.  If the RECORD TYPE NEEDED is populated
      only those records and the Administrative records will print.
  
  2) STC-0403-42187   Borrower Set Up Option
  
     Problem:
     ========
      The user is unable to edit a BORROWER in the Hospital Location file
      that has been reactivated until after the reactivation date.
      Reactivated a clinic with a future date, but was unable to edit the
      Borrower until that date.
       
     Solution:
     =========
      Modify RTSYS routine to allow edits if the locations REACTIVATE  
      DATE field is populated with a future date.
