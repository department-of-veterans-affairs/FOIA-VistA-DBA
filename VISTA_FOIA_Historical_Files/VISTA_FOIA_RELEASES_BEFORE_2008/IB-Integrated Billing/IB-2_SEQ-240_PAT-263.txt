Subject: CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING RESOLUTION AND INSURANCE BUFFER ERRORS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an error which is generated when trying to use the 
 View an EOB [IBCE EOB VIEW] protocol selection on the Claims Status 
 Awaiting Resolution screen.  This error occurs when the bill that is 
 selected for viewing does not have an associated EOB.  This patch also 
 corrects the display of insurance company choices when entering data 
 into the insurance buffer.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1. SBY-0104-30665   <NULLSUBSCR>GETEOB+11^IBCECSA6:1
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Claims Status Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS
    AWAITING] option and when selecting the View an EOB [IBCE EOB VIEW]
    protocol choice, the program would get an error if the selected bill did
    not actually have an EOB on file.  The source for this error was in
    routine IBCECSA5 which was calling IBCECSA6 even when there was no EOB
    available.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The code was modified to recognize the situation of no EOB and
    in that case, does not continue trying to display one.
  
 2. MIN-0104-41017   IIV Buffer File (Specific COs can't be Added)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When adding data to the Insurance Buffer, some insurance company
    names were not being displayed as choices.  This occurred when 
    there were several entries with the same name and the first entry
    was inactive.  The look up function was seeing the inactive entry
    and stopping.  That name would not be displayed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The program has been modified to check all entries under a 
    given name and allow the name if any entry is found to be
    active.  For example, if the Insurance Company file contained:
      35  AETNA   GALVESTON  INACTIVE
      42  AETNA   BROWNSVILLE  INACTIVE
      59  AETNA   HOUSTON   ACTIVE
    the previous look up program would not have returned AETNA as a 
    valid choice.  The corrected version will show it.
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
  
 1. SBY-0104-30665   <NULLSUBSCR>GETEOB+11^IBCECSA6:1
  
    The line INIT+10^IBCECSA5 has been changed from:
    I $G(VALMCNT)=1 S IBCNT=$P($G(^TMP("IBCECSD",$J,1)),U,2),IBONE=1
 ... D BLD^IBCECSA6
  
    to:
    I $G(VALMCNT)=1 S IBCNT=$P($G(^TMP("IBCECSD",$J,1)),U,2),IBONE=1
 ... I IBCNT D BLD^IBCECSA6
  
    In some instances, IBCNT could be NULL.  The change in the code
    does not allow BLD^IBCECSA6 to be called if that is the case.
  
 2. MIN-0104-41017   IIV Buffer File (Specific COs can't be Added)
  
    The subroutine DICINS^IBCNBU1 has been modified to do an additional
    level of looping as it processes the B and C cross references.
    Previously, it only checked the first $O record at the name level and
    selected it if the record was active or quit if the record was
    inactive.  It now $Orders through all duplicates of a name checking
    the status.  If any one of the duplicate names is active, the name is
    selected for display to the user.
