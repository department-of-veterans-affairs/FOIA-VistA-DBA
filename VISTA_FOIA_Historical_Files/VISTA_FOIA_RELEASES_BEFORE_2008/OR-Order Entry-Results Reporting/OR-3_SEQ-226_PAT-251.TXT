  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch contains two issues that are follow-ups to patch OR*3.0*215
 (CPRS GUI 26.) 
  
 The first issue deals with medication orders that are ordered during an IMO
 ordering session.  These were not causing the MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - OUTPT
 alert to fire.  This problem was discovered during the final stages of 
 testing patch OR*3.0*215 and has been fixed in this patch.
  
 The second issue was a graphing problem such that when a Drug Class selection
 was made the medication would not display.  The display of medications was
 fixed when selecting Drug Class and the response delay was avoided.
