 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1. LEX-0803-40984  FBUCSTAT Needs Fixed
     
    Problem:
    -------
    The old version of the routine was including rejected payments in the 
    counts. It also did not count records not having a primary service
    facility.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify the routine to check for and not include rejected payments in 
    the counts.  The routine was also modified to include records that do
    not have a primary service facility entered.
