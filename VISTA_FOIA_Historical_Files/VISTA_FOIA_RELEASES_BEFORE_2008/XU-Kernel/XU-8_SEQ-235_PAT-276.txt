Subject: INFORMATIONAL PATCH FOR NEW EMPLOYEE WITH ONE NAME

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 NOIS: MIN 1201-41368, PAL-0501-62575
 Test sites: Black Hills Health Care System
  
 This information patch provides the two short-term solutions to input a 
 new person who does not have a first name for NEW PERSON file (#200) or 
 PAID EMPLOYEE file (#450).
  
 The first short-term solution:
 ==============================
 We can put any kind of mnemonic in the First Name field to satisfy 
 the required field. For examples: 'NFN' for No First Name, 'DR' for a 
 Physician, 'RN' for a Nurse, etc... 
  
 The second short-term solution:
 ============================== 
 We may create a new first name for persons who have no first name,
 then we delete the first name.
 To delete the first name, we can use VA FileMan's Modify File 
 Attributes option, select NAME COMPONENTS file (#20), Given (First) Name 
 field (#2), and then change the field's Mandatory attribute to 'NO'.  
 Then use FM's Edit option, select NAME COMPONENTS file (#20),  select the 
 person with one name, be sure the person's name is in the Family Name 
 field and delete any entry in the Given Name field.  Then set the Source 
 Name Format Flags to 'L'.  Finally, set back the Mandatory attribute on 
 the Given Name field to 'YES'.
  
 1) Change the field's Mandatory attribute to 'NO':

    ---------------------------------------------
  
 Select ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES from VA FileMan Option menu.
 Select VA FileMan Option: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: NAME COMPONENTS// 20 NAME COMPONENTS
                                       ^
                                       ----- ENTER 20
  
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// SOURCE NAME FORMAT FLAGS
                         ^
                         ----- ENTER THE WORD 'SOURCE' OR ENTIRE LINE
 THEN EDIT FIELD:        (HIT ENTER KEY) 
  
 Select NAME COMPONENTS FILE: TEST    200  .01  11389,  TEST
                              ^
                              ----- ENTER THE PERSON'S NAME 
  
 SOURCE NAME FORMAT FLAGS: ?? <-- You may enter '??' for more information. 
  
         When the name fields in the Name Components file are edited, the 
         "ANAME" cross-reference updates the corresponding name field in
         the source file. This SOURCE NAME FORMAT FLAGS field can be used 
         to control the format of the name placed in the source name field.
          
         Answer with the flags used in $$NAMEFMT^XLFNAME API. For example, 
          
           C  : Return a Comma between the Family (Last) and Given (First)
                Names.
           L  : Truncate the returned name to the maximum length as 
                specified
                by the data type of the source name field.
           L# : Truncate the returned name to a maximum length of #
                characters, where # is an integer between 1 and 256.
           S  : Standardize the name components before building the 
                formatted name.
          
         If this field is null (i.e., no flags are specified), the default 
         is "CLS".
  
 SOURCE NAME FORMAT FLAGS: L
                           ^
                           -----ENTER A 'L'
  
 4) Set back the Mandatory attribute on the Given Name field to 'YES':
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Repeat step (1), but answer 'Y' on the question:
  
 DATA TYPE OF GIVEN (FIRST) NAME: FREE TEXT   (FIELD DEFINITION IS NOT 
 EDITABLE)
 IS GIVEN (FIRST) NAME ENTRY MANDATORY (Y/N): N// Y  YES
 ....                                             ^
                                                  ----- ANSWER 'YES'
