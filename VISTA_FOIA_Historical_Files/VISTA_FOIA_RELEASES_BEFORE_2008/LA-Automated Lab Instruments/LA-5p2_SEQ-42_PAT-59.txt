  - Routine

Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*59 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 Patch LA*5.2*59 addresses a fix to the Lab Universal Interface (UI)
 incoming message processing. Released patch LA*5.2*57 introduced changes
 to the processing of HL7 result (ORU) messages that can result in the
 processing routine LA7UIIN1 entering an endless loop. This occurs when the
 UI processes a message that is for an accession area that is not associated
 with the "CH" subscript. Patch LA*5.2*59 changes routine LA7UIIN1 to ignore
 results for accessions that are not in the "CH" or "MI" subscripts if the
 site is a test site for under development patch LA*5.2*41. Patch LA*5.2*41
 adds support for microbiology instruments results that are processed within
 the "MI" subscript.
  
 As part of the install of this patch, the post-install routine performs
 a check to determine if under development patch LA*5.2*41 has been
 installed. If patch LA*5.2*41 is detected a mail message will be
 triggered to the Lab Development team at the Dallas OI Field Office.
 The message will contain information concerning patch routine checksums,
 status of patch installation from the PACKAGE file (#9.4) and a copy
 of the patch routines.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel, MailMan and HL7 patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
       prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
       option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in your
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
       a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*59'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
   8. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
   9. Routine LA59 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
