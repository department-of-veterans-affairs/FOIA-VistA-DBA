Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*104
  
 Y2K Waiver Exemption ID: WE0008
  
 NOIS:  MAD-1099-41351
 Test Site:  Madison, WI
 Routines: ^XMXADDR, ^XMXADDR1, ^XMXADDRD
 If a user enters an address, which is a device name or option name or remote
 address which has exact, as well as partial, matches in the DEVICE,
 OPTION, or DOMAIN files, MailMan rightly asks the user to select one.
  
 If a mail group contains a device name or option name or remote address
 which has exact, as well as partial, matches, MailMan should automatically
 select the exact match.  However, it doesn't.  This patch makes MailMan
 select the exact match.
  
 Also in this patch,
 ^XMDF     - Correct code which is never executed.
 ^XMGAPI3  - Prepare for name change from FORUM.VA.GOV to FORUM.MED.VA.GOV
 ^XMJMD    - Correct how largest message number is obtained.
 ^XMVGROUP - If a site has faxing enabled, allow mail group edit options
             to edit fax multiples in mail group file.
 ^XMXADDR1 - Don't accept broadcast messages from remote sites.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*101.
