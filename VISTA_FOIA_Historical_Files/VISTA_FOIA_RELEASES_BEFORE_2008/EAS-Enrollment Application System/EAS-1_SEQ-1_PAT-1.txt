Description: 
============

 Patch EAS*1*1 addresses a number of issues discovered during User
 Acceptance Testing of EAS v1.0, but which were not considered
 critical enough to warrant delay of the release.
    
 (1) A new option has been added to the 10-10EZ Menu [EAS EZ MENU].
     The name of the option is Remove Signature Verification [EAS 
     EZ REMOVE SIGNATURE] and it allows the user to remove a 10-10EZ
     Application from the 'Signed' status.  This means that the
     Application will be placed back into either the 'Printed, Pending 
     Signature' or the 'In Review' status for further processing.
   
     The local site may elect to add a security key to the new option
     to better control its use, if the 10-10EZ Menu is widely 
     distributed.  The site Enrollment Coordinator(s) should be
     consulted regarding distribution of this new option.
   
     To implement this new functionality, two new fields are added to
     the 1010EZ HOLDING file (#712) for audit purposes: 
   
     SIG. REMOVAL DATE (#4.6) - date on which signature verification
                                was removed.
     SIG. REMOVED BY (#4.7) - user who removed signature verification.
   
 (2) Help information regarding the 1010EZ processing actions is 
     available by entering single or double question marks at the
     Select Action: prompt within List Manager.
   
     User help information is now being extended by adding a number of 
     Help Frames to the module.
   
     The Help Frame help is accessible if the user enters a double  
     question mark at the initial 1010EZ processing prompt, as follows:
              
              QL     10-10EZ Quick Lookup
              EZ     Electronic 10-10EZ Processing
              RS     Remove Signature Verification
      
           Select 10-10EZ Menu Option: EZ  Electronic 10-10EZ Processing
     
    
           10-10EZ Application Processing --
     
    
                Select one of the following:
      
                     1         New
                     2         In Review
                     3         Printed, Pending Signature
                     4         Signed
                     5         Filed
                     6         Inactivated
     
           Select Applications to View: ??   <--- this calls Help Frames
    
 (3) Within the List Manager interface for 1010EZ processing, the Accept 
     Field (AF) action could only be used to 'accept' a single 1010EZ data
     element.  This functionality has been revised to allow the user to
     also specify multiple data elements for acceptance.  As before, the
     user may select only those data elements on the current List Manager
     screen.
   
     So if the current screen display shows data elements on lines 37
     through 48, the following are examples of a single field and multi-
     field selection:
      
           Select Action: Next Screen// AF=39   Accept Field
      
           Select Action: Next Screen// AF   Accept Field  
           Select Line Item(s):  (37-48): 39-44,46,48
    
     Users should remember that 'acceptance' can be toggled on and off
     by successive uses of Accept Field on the same data element.  Only 
     those 1010EZ data elements which are 'accepted' will be filed into 
     the VistA Patient database when the File 1010EZ action is performed.  
     Only those data elements which appear in reverse video on the List 
     Manager screen have been 'accepted'.
     
 (4) It was possible for data to be updated in the following PATIENT file
     (#2) fields by the 1010EZ module:
     
     SERVICE CONNECTED (#.301)
     SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302)
     CLAIM NUMBER (#.313)
     RECEIVING A VA PENSION (#.36235)
   
     1010EZ Applications received by your site after installation of
     EAS*1*1 will be blocked from updating these fields under the
     following circumstances.
   
     The 1010EZ Applicant is linked to an existing Patient 
     in file #2. 
   
     (a) If the Patient record has an ELIGIBILITY STATUS (#.3611)  
         field of 'Verified', then field #.313 cannot be overwritten.
     
     (b) If the Patient record also has an ELIGIBILITY VERIF. SOURCE 
         (#.3613) field value of 'HEC', then fields #.301, #.302, and
         #.36235 cannot be overwritten.
    
 (5) When 1010EZ data is filed into the VistA Patient database, each
     data element must pass through FileMan validity checks.  It is 
     possible that one or more data elements will be rejected in 
     this process.  Since 1010EZ data filing is a non-interactive, 
     background process, the responsible user will probably not be  
     aware that a data rejection occurred.
   
     This patch modifies the software so that an informational message
     is sent to the responsible user (i.e., the user who invoked the
     File 1010EZ action for the Application) whenever a data rejection 
     occurs.  The message identifies the Application involved, the 
     file/field for which data was rejected, and the rejection reason.
     The user may employ an appropriate Registration option (e.g.,  
     Load/Edit Patient Data) to supply appropriate data if necessary.
   
     The following is an example message:
    
     Subj: EAS 1010EZ Error Report for APP #120 [#3249] 27 Mar 01 17:17
     From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     Errors were returned by the FileMan validator when filing 1010EZ 
     data for --
     Applicant:     SMITH,JOHN Q.
     Application #: 120
     Filing Date:   MAR 27, 2001
     
     1010EZ data for APPLICANT was not filed to
     Field #.117 of File #2 because:
     The value 'BUXBY' for field COUNTY in file PATIENT is not
     valid.
    
     1010EZ data for APPLICANT was not filed to
     Field #.07 of File #408.22 because:
     The value '0' for field AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE in file 
     INCOME RELATION is not valid.
   
     1010EZ data for CHILD #3 was not filed to
     Field #.09 of File #408.13 because:
     The value '777777777' for field SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER in file 
     INCOME PERSON is not valid.
    
 (6) In addition to the above UAT issues, a problem in the List Manager 
     interface was reported in NOIS SPO-0301-52782.  It was possible that
     the user could cause the program to abort with a <Null Subscript> 
     error after being returned to the Application listing by Status 
     screen.  The circumstances causing the error are as follows:
   
         - the user accomplishes a change in Status for a 10-10EZ 
           Application;
         - that Application was the only one in the prior Status 
           list;
         - the user attempts to re-select the same line number 
           (i.e., 1) after being returned to the now empty Status
           list screen.
   
     An additional validity check has been placed in the selection 
     code to prevent this error.
     
 (7) Several formatting changes were made to improve the display of
     information in the 10-10EZ Quick Lookup [EAS EZ QUICK LOOKUP]
     option.
    
 (8) A post-installation routine, EAS1P, is included in order to update
     the PACKAGE field (#12) in the OPTION file (#19) for each of the 
     five options currently in the EAS package.  The EAS1P routine will
     be deleted by KIDS as soon as the installation completes.
