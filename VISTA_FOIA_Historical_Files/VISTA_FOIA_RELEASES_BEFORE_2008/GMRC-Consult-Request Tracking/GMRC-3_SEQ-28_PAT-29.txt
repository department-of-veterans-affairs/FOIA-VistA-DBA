Subject: Miscellaneous fixes/enhancements

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects several problems as well as enhancing several 
 functions within the Consult/Request Tracking Package. 
  
 Changes/Enhancements:
  
 1) When Consult/Request Tracking reports are run, if a large grouper 
 of services are selected for statistical analysis, an allocation error
 (DSM) or a store error (Cache) can occur. With this patch, any number
 of services can be selected without danger of this error.  
 (NOIS  ELP-1101-71216 and WCO-1101-50392)
   
 2) When using the Service Consults Completed or Pending Resolution, 
 Print Service Consults by Status and Service Consults Pending Resolution
 options, one of the totals listed in the reports may be new incorrect or
 misleading. If any status criteria other than All Statuses is chosen, the
 total of requests listed is actually the total within the criteria chosen
 while it indicates that it is the total requests for the service.  
 (NOIS PUG-0802-51932)
  
 3) In rare cases, the possibility existed to set invalid global nodes at 
 the ^GMR(123,0,40, level. This patch prevents the future setting of any of
 these nodes as well as cleaning up any existing nodes via a post-install
 routine. (NOIS MIW-0702-40593)
  
 4) The Add Comment action will now send notifications automatically based
 upon the user taking the action. If the user is the ordering provider, the
 service update users configured to receive notifications will be notified.
 If the user entering the comment is an update user, the ordering provider
 will be notified. If the user is neither, the ordering provider and the
 update users configured to receive notifications will be notified.  
 (NOIS LON-0701-62384, E3Rs #13654, #17381)
  
 5) This patch corrects the situation where the Add Comment action is 
 taken on a consult and the LAST ACTION field is not updated appropriately.
 (NOIS MAR-1002-20092)
  
 6) The footer section of the SF-513 has been modified to include the 
 Primary Eligibility (SC %) of the patient.  (E3R #17597)

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 Users may remain on the system during installation of this patch but it 
 is recommended that it be installed at a non-peak time due to the high 
 volume usage of the routines included. Installation should take less than 
 two minutes.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*29):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       GMRC*3.0*29.
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//' respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
