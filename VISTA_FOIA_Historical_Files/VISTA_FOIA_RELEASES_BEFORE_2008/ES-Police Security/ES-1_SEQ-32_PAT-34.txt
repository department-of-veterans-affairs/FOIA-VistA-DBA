 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
 1. FRE-0100-62973     Open Evidence Records printing out of order
  
       Problem
       -------
       When exercising the Print Open Evidence/Property Records [ESP
       EVIDENCE PRINT-OPEN] option, the evidence records are sorted by the
       RECORD NUMBER (#.01) field instead of by the DATE/TIME OBTAINED
       (#.03) field in the ESP EVIDENCE (#910.8) file.  This allowed records
       created after the year 2000 to be displayed ahead of records created
       before 2000.  Since these records should be displayed from oldest to
       most recent, this needed to be corrected.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       Modified the ESP OPEN EVIDENCE RECORDS sort template to sort by
       DATE/TIME OBTAINED instead of by RECORD NUMBER.  This insures that
       the records will be printed in the correct order.
