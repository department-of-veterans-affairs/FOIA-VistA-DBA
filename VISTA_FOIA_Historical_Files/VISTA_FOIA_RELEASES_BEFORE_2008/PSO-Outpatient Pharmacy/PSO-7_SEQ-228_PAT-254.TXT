Description:
============

 For the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
 National Provider Identifier (NPI) project, this patch will create and
 populate the new NPI INSTITUTION field (#101) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file
 (#59). This patch will also change the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO
 SITE PARAMETERS] option to allow the user to edit this new field as shown
 below:
  
        NAME: ALBANY// 
  
        ...
  
        Select CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION:
        RELATED INSTITUTION: ALBANY// 
        NPI INSTITUTION: ALBANY// 
    
        ...
   
 When this patch is installed, the information in this field will be 
 automatically populated through a post-install routine. The correct
 institution will be identified using the existing NCPDP NUMBER field
 (#1008) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), along with a list of
 pre-defined NPI numbers, which should match to NPI numbers previously 
 assigned to each institution by the KERNEL V. 8.0 patch XU*8*410.
    
 The PSO SITE input template is being changed to include this new field.
 Therefore, the user will be able to manually add/edit/delete the NPI
 INSTITUTION field (#101) through the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO
 SITE PARAMETERS] option.
   
 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: All active outpatient sites MUST have an NPI INSTITUTION assigned.
 This is very important for sites currently performing third party
 electronic billing (ePharmacy) because the NPI number will replace the 
 previous NCPDP (National Council for Prescription Drug Programs) number 
 used to identify the dispensing pharmacy. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 For active sites that do not have an NPI INSTITUTION assigned after the
 installation of this patch, using the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE
 PARAMETERS] option enter the correct institution for each site. In order
 to help you identify which sites have and which ones have not been 
 assigned an NPI INSTITUTION, the post-install routine will generate a 
 Mailman message which will be sent to the user installing the patch as 
 well as Pharmacy users indicated by the installer during the installation.
 (see installation instructions below). Below is an example of the Mailman
 message:
