 Installation:
 ============
  
 Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not
 currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the
 day with minimal disruption to users.  Installtion should not take longer
 than 10-15 minutes.
  
   1.   DSM and MSM sites - You will need to disbale any routines within
        the KMPS* namespace.
        
   2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
        
   3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
        
   4.   As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you
        do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.
        
   5.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install
        Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*1.
