Subject: Prompt for Consult on Title Change

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the problem of not being prompted for a consult when
 changing the title of a progress note to a note title that is under the 
 Consult class or Consult document class. 
  
  
 PROBLEM RESOLVED:
 =================
 Users were able to change a title of a progress note from a title not in 
 the Consult class to a title in the Consult class without being prompted 
 to associate the progress note with a consult.
  
 This patch prevents changing a title of a progress note to a consult title
 without linking the note to a consult. When changing a progress note title
 to a Consult title the author will be presented with a list of consult
 request for which they can act on. If a consult is not selected the note
 title is not changed.
