Subject: FIX 3 UNDEFINED ERRORS IN IFCAP PACKAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three UNDEFINED errors in the IFCAP package.
  
 The first error occurs in the option, PRCH CREATE PURCHASE CARD , when 
 a user deletes a Repetitive Item List that is being used by another user.
  
 The second error occurs when running the option, Mandatory Sources 850
 Undelivered Orders, when there are 0 records to report.  
  
 The third UNDEFINED error occurs in the option, History of Item 
 Display/Print, when the user tries to quit the report display with
 an '^' at the start of a new page.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD96198  Undefined error in PRCH442
  
   Problem:
   -------           
  
   It is possible for more than one user to be running the Create P/C Order
   From Repetitive Item List option at the same time.  If the Repetitive 
   Item List (RIL) is deleted at the conclusion of processing by one user, 
   the second user will error out of the routine.
  
   Resolution:
   ---------- 
  
   A check for the existence of the RIL was put in place after the creation
   of the purchase order.  If the RIL does not exist, an error message is
   displayed and the purchase order is deleted.
  
  
 2. HD120424  <UNDEF>SUB^PRCFUOMS
      
   Problem:
   -------
  
   While running the option, Mandatory Sources 850 Undelivered Orders, if
   no records are found, an UNDEFINED error occurs while trying to display
   the site number causing the processing to stop.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
  
   If no records are found, the code was changed to not display the site 
   number.
  
 3. HD124347  <UNDEFINED>ITEM0+16^PRCHRPT1
  
   Problem:
   -------           
  
   When running the option, History of Item Display/Print, and the user
   gets to the next page, they are allowed to enter '^' to exit the
   display/print feature.  If they use '^' to exit and the item they are
   displaying has orders with multiple Fund Control Points (FCP), an
   UNDEFINED error is encountered because the code is trying to display a
   message about the FCP, but the FCP is no longer defined.
  
   Resolution:
   ---------- 
  
   The message about the FCP is not valid during the exiting procedure.  
   Code was put in place to check for this scenario and to exit cleanly 
   rather than trying to display this message.
