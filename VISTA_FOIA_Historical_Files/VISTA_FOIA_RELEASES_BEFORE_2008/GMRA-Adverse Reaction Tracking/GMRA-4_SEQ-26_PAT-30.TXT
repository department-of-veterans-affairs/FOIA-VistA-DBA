Subject: PREVENT DECEASED PATIENTS FROM APPEARING ON REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses Remedy ticket HD67463, where deceased patients are
 appearing on the Patient Not Asked Report [GMRA PRINT-PATIENTS NOT ASKED].
 The sites use this report to identify patients who have not had an
 allergy/adverse reaction assessment.  The sites then follow up with the
 patients on the list to get the allergy information.
  
 By preventing deceased patients from appearing on this list, the sites
 will not be attempting to contact the family of a deceased individual
 for this assessment.

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ====================
 HD67463/MWV-0302-20455
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Deceased patients are appearing on the [GMRA PRINT-PATIENTS NOT ASKED]
 report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As the report is printing, determine whether the patient is deceased.  If
 the patient is deceased, exclude them from the report.
  
  
 TECHNICAL RESOLUTION:
 ====================
 In the routine GMRAPNA, which is the print driver for the [GMRA PRINT-
 PATIENTS NOT ASKED] report, add a conditional quit which calls the 
 function DECEASED^GMRAFX.  If the function returns true, the patient
 is deceased, and will be excluded from the report.
