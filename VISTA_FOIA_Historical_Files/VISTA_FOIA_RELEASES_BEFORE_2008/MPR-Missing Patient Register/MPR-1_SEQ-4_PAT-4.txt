Subject: CHANGE DEFAULT SEARCH TYPE TO FULL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 'Enter/Edit Missing Patient' [MPR MISSING ENTER/EDIT] allows for two types of
 searches.  In order for the missing patient information to be distributed to 
 all facilities, the 'Type of Search' question must be set to 'F'ull.  This 
 patch will change the default response to 'F'ull instead of 'P'reliminary. 
 Additional detail has been included in the help text of the data dictionary
 for File #850 Missing Patient Registry, to further clarify the difference 
 between the two types of searches.

 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to
 users.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 ****
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
     patch text only.] 
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed

     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MPR*1.0*4):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPR*1.0*4.
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//".
     respond NO. 
                  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
     you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
 	Enter/Edit Missing Patient		MPR MISSING ENTER/EDIT
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 9.  Delete any pre/post install routines after successful patch
     Installation  E.g.  Delete all MPR104* routines
