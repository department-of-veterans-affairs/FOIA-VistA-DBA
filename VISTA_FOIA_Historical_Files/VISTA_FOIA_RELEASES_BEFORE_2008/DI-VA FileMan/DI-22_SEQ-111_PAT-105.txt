Subject: DD LISTING ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch makes several enhancements and bug fixes to VA FileMan's data
 dictionary listings, found under the option: DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES ->
 LIST FILE ATTRIBUTES.
  
 Routine: DID
 ------------
 1. Change: With this patch, if you select the Standard, Modified Standard,
 or Brief data dictionary listings, VA FileMan prompts you for a specific
 range of fields to print. For example:
  
      Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD//   
      Start with field: FIRST// .01
      Go to field: .05
  
 (Note that if you select a specific range of fields, VA FileMan excludes
 from the printout the file information at the beginning of the report, and
 the template and record-level index information at the end of the report.)
  
 If you press <Enter> at the "Start with field: FIRST//" prompt, VA FileMan
 displays the listing as before, and includes all the fields in the file.
  
 2. Change: With this patch, if you select the Indexes Only listing, VA 
 FileMan will prompt you for a type of cross-reference to print 
 (Traditional, New-Style, or Both), and then for a specific field. For 
 example:
  
      Select LISTING FORMAT: STANDARD// INDEXES ONLY  
      What type of cross-reference (Traditional or New)? Both// NEW
      Which field: ALL// .01  NAME
  
 Routines: DID1, DIDH1
 ---------------------
 3. Before this patch, write identifiers failed to print on the Standard 
 and Modified Standard DD listings. This has been corrected.
  
 4. With this patch, in the Standard and Modified Standard listings of
 identifiers defined on the file, an [R] is placed next to those fields
 that are required fields. For example:
  
      IDENTIFIED BY: SSN (#1), DOB (#2)[R], CODES (#201)[R]
  
 In this case, both DOB and CODES are required identifiers. SSN is an 
 identifier but not required.
  
        
 DIDH1, DIDC
 -----------
 5. With this patch, if File Access Security (Part 3 of Kernel) has been 
 installed, the Standard, Modified Standard, and Condensed listings include
 the following text, printed after the VA FileMan File Security Codes:
  
      (NOTE: Kernel's File Access Security has been installed in this UCI.)
  
  
 Routine: DID2
 -------------
 6. With this patch, the Standard and Modified Standard listings include
 with each field the following previously omitted information, if defined:
  
      AUDIT
        Can be "YES, ALWAYS" or "EDITED OR DELETED." This corresponds to
        the data in ^DD(file#,field#,"AUDIT").
                 
      AUDIT CONDITION
        M code that determines if a field is audited. This corresponds to
        the data in ^DD(file#,field#,"AX").
        
      PRE-LOOKUP
        Valid only for .01 fields, this is the pre-lookup transform stored 
        in ^DD(file#,.01,7.5).
        
      DELETE TEST
        M code that determines if the field can be deleted. This 
        corresponds to the data in ^DD(file#,field#,"DEL",#,0).
        
      LAYGO TEST
        Valid only for .01 fields, this is M code that determines if an
        entry can be added. This corresponds to the data in 
        ^DD(file#,.01,"LAYGO",#,0).
  
  
 Routine: DIDG
 -------------
 7. With this patch the Global Map DD listing includes for pointers the
 pointed-to file number. For example:
  
    ^DIZ(16000,D0,0)= (#.01) NAME [1F] ^ TITLE [2P:3.1]
                                                   ^-the pointed-to file

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 This patch can be installed with VISTA users online. However, it is
 recommended that it be installed or queued for install during non-peak
 times.
  
 TaskMan does not need to be STOPPED or placed in a WAIT state.
  
   1.  AXP/DSM sites: Review your mapped routine set. If any of the
 routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should
 be removed from the mapped set at this time. (In the VA FileMan Technical
 Manual, none of the routines in this patch are recommended for mapping.)
  
   2.  Use the "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" option on the PackMan menu. This
 option loads the patch into a Transport Global on your system.
  
   3.  On the KIDS menu, select the "Installation" menu, and use the
 following options to install the Transport Global:
  
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Backup a Transport Global
        Install Package(s)
  
        Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*105
                             ===========
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO
                                                        ==
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
  
   4.  AXP/DSM sites: Answer NO to the question "Want to MOVE routines to
 other CPUs?"
  
   5.  AXP/DSM sites: After the patch has been installed, if any routines
 were removed from the mapped set in Step 1 above, rebuild your map set.
