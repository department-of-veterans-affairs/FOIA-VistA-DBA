Subject: PATIENT AGE REPORTING ISSUE FOR VISTARAD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve patient safety issue PSI-06-073.
      
 Imaging reports displayed in VistARad currently
 show a patient's current age regardless of when the imaging 
 was completed.  This is an incorrect display of patient data.  
 The Radiology Informatics Committee has requested that 
 Date of Birth be displayed instead of current age.

 HD0000000146291 - Patient Age Problem in VistARAD/Radiology
           
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem
 -------
 VistARAD utilizes DBIA 2877 for API EN3^RAO7PC3.  This API returns
 an entire imaging/Radiology report via a temporary global (^TMP($J)).
 Returned in this global data is the patient age, as text, and is 
 subsequently used in VistARAD reporting.  The patient age displayed
 is current and does not reflect the age of the patient when the 
 imaging work was completed.
           
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made in routine RARTR0 to replace patient age 
 with the patient's Date of Birth in the temporary global for use by
 VistARAD.
      
 In order to retain the same line spacing on VistARad reports the former 
 display of male, female or unknown will now be displayed as M for Male, 
 F for Female or UNK for unknown.
