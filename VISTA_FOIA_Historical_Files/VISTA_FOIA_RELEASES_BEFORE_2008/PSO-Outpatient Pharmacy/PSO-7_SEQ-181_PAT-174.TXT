Description:
============

 I. NOIS HUN-0304-22601,HUN-0105-21151,MAC-0205-60098,PAL-0604-61760
 In regards to an error reported at site, ORC+7^PSOHLSG1 and 
 GETDATA+9^PSOHLDS1, there are a couple of ways this error can be generated.
  
 Scenario # 1a:
 1. The OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), EXTERNAL INTERFACE field (#5) is 
 set to send all orders and print label.
 2. Using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 option, a partial prescription is ordered for today and then deleted.
 It generates the above error in the error trap.
  
 Scenario # 1b: Similar to 1a (above)
 1. The OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), EXTERNAL INTERFACE field (#5) is 
 set to send all orders and print label.
 2. Using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 option, create a new order.  Next, create 2 partial orders, one for T+1 
 and the other for T+2.  Suspend partial number 2, then delete partial 
 number 2.  Enter Outpatient Pharmacy Manager [PSO MANAGER] option and
 choose [PRINT FROM SUSPENSE] option.  Review error trap for errors.
  
 Scenario # 2:
 1. The OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), SLAVED LABEL PRINTING field (#.2) is set to
 NO. 
 2. Using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
 a partial prescription is ordered for a future date, put into suspense at
 the label Queue prompt and then deleted.
 3. Using the Print from Suspense file [PSO PNDLBL] option, print the label
 through to the suspended date. This generates the above error in the error trap.
  
 This patch will remove the deleted partial from the label, bingo board 
 list and suspense file if suspended and not generate the above error to 
 the error trap.
  
 If a partial was deleted before this patch was installed and printed from
 suspense after the patch is installed, to avoid the error the entry
 created by this partial in the suspense file will be ignored.
  
 II. NOIS CON-0404-11869
 A methadone prescription which matches the methadone drug
 in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), METHADONE DRUG field (#.52) is ordered,
 label printed and released. When the Nightly Management Data Compile Job 
 [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE] option is run the next day, and the methadone 
 drug was the only drug released the previous day, an undefined error 
 is generated. This patch will correct this issue.

  Server Installation Instructions:
  =================================
  
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
  
  Installation will take about 5 minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
       be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*174)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*174
  
    6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//" respond NO.
  
    7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
    8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
