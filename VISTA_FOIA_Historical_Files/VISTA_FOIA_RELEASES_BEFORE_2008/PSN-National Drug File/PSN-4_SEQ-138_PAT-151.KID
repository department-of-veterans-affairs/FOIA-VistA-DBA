Patch PSN*4*148 inadvertently deleted the GCNSEQNO field (#11) for four
"BLD",1002,1,2,0)
entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).  This field provides mapping to
"BLD",1002,1,3,0)
patient medication instructions sheets.  The four entries involved are:
"BLD",1002,1,4,0)
 
"BLD",1002,1,5,0)
DIGOXIN (LANOXIN) 0.125MG TAB

"BLD",1002,1,10,0)
This patch restores those fields.
