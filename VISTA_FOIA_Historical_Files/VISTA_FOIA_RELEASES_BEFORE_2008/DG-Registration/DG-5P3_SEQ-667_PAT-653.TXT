Subject: ENROLLMENT VISTA CHANGES TO SUPPORT ESR (RELEASE 1)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support
 technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
 of the HEC Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) project.  Modified and new 
 business functionality is included in the ESR system which necessitates 
 changes in the VistA system as ESR is brought online.  These changes will 
 ensure a smooth transition from one system of record to the other.  
 Further, the changes introduced by this patch will assure the correct 
 preliminary determination of a veteran's Enrollment and Eligibility 
 status during this transitional period.   The EVC project will be 
 released in two phases.  This release represents EVC Release 1.
  
 This patch will be released with Income Verification patch IVM*2*105 in a 
 single host file, DG_53_P653.KID.
   
 Features of this project are as follows:
   
  1. Data Sharing between VistA and HEC has been enhanced in order to 
     support the ESR project.
    
     - The following fields have been added to the HL7 Z07 message 
       builder to support ESR:
   
       Veteran Indicator
       P&T Effective Date
       SHAD Status
       Spouse's Maiden Name
       Dependent Child School Indicator

       Pseudo SSN Reason (spouse/dependent)
       MT Version Indicator
       BAI Permanent Address
       Pager Number
       Cell Phone Number
       Email Address
       Confidential Address
       Site last updated Temporary Address
       Date/Time Stamp, Source of change and site cell phone number
       Date/time Stamp, Source of change and site email address
       Date/time stamp, Source of change and site pager
       Confidential address/date/time and site last updated 
       Appointment Request on 1010EZ
       Appointment Request Date
       Patient Sensitivity Status
       Patient Sensitivity Date/Time Last Set
       NOK1 Date/Time Last Updated
       Temporary Address Date/Time Last Updated
       Date Veteran Requested CD Review (placeholder for post ESR)
       Date Facility Initiated CD Review (placeholder for post ESR)
       Date Veteran Was Notified CD (placeholder for post ESR)
       Contact date/time last updated (NOK1)
      
     - The following fields have been added to the HL7 Z11 message 
       receiver:
  
       SHAD Status
       Patient Sensitivity Status
       Patient Sensitivity Date/Time Last Set
       Appointment Request on 1010EZ
       Appointment Request Date
       Date Veteran Requested CD Review
       Date Facility Initiated CD Review
       Date Veteran Was Notified CD
       Veteran Indicator
   
     - The following field has been added to the HL7 Z05 message 
       receiver:
       
       Beneficiary Rated Incompetent
   
     - The following fields have been added to the HL7 Z10 message 
       receiver:
  
       Spouse's Maiden Name
       Dependent Child School Indicator
       Pseudo SSN (spouse/dependent)
       Pseudo SSN Reason (spouse/dependent)
  
     - Information about the HL7 segment locations for the new fields 
       can be found in the HL7 Segment Table Definitions in Appendix B of
       the IVM 2.0 Technical Manual which has been updated to include the
       added fields and is being distributed with this release (see the
       Documentation and Retrieval section below).
  
   
  2. Ability to Display Project 112/SHAD Exposure
     
    - A new field, #.32115 PROJ 112/SHAD, has been added to the PATIENT 
      file #2 to store the SHAD indicator.   The field will be
      non-editable, and will be populated when the indicator is sent in the
      Z11 HL7 message from the HEC.
    
    - Screen 7 (Eligibility Status Data) in Registration has been modified
      to display "Proj 112/SHAD: YES", only if the indicator is "YES".  If
      the indicator is "NO" or null, nothing will be displayed.
    
    - The enrollment priority algorithm has been modified to put Veterans
      with a SHAD indicator of "YES" into priority group 6, unless
      otherwise eligible for a higher priority.  If the SHAD indicator is
      changed to "NO" or deleted (by HEC only), the Veteran may be placed
      in a rejected enrollment status and not be continuously enrolled if
      their sole eligibility for enrollment was SHAD exposure.
  
    - The HL7 Z07 message builder was modified in order to send the SHAD 
      indicator to the HEC. The HL7 Z11 message receiver was modified to
      file the SHAD indicator when sent from the HEC.
    
  3. Pseudo SSN and Pseudo SSN Reason 
    
     - The system has been modified to allow the entry of a Pseudo SSN for
       a veteran's spouse and/or dependent(s) via Registration Screen 8 and
       the Means Test Screen for dependents/spouse.
    
     - If a Pseudo SSN is entered for the patient, spouse and/or 
       dependents, the system has been modified to require a reason to be
       entered for the Pseudo SSN. The user is not allowed to continue with
       the data entry until a reason is selected.
      
       The available reasons are as follows: 
         
         Refused to Provide
         SSN Unknown/Follow-up Required
         No SSN Assigned
  
       The new PSEUDO SSN REASON field #.0906 has been added to the PATIENT
       file #2.  The new PSEUDO SSN REASON field #.1 has been added to the
       INCOME PERSON file #408.13.
    
     - If a Pseudo SSN is present, the display of the Pseudo SSN Reason has
       been added to the following locations:
  
         . Screen 1 of Registration (for the patient), 
         . Screen 8 of Registration, and 
         . the Means Test Spouse/Dependent Data screen (for the spouse 
           and/or dependents).
    
     - Two new reports have been added for Pseudo SSN.  One report is for 
       Patients with a Pseudo SSN.  The report lists all veterans, all 
       non-veterans, or both with a Pseudo SSN and a specified Pseudo SSN
       Reason or all Pseudo SSN Reasons.  The second report lists all
       spouses and dependents with a Pseudo SSN for a specified Pseudo SSN
       Reason or all Pseudo SSN Reasons.
    
     - A new style cross reference (AVAFC0906) has been added to the Pseudo
       SSN Reason field in the Patient file to notify MPI when this field
       has been edited.
   
  4. Consistency Checks added to the Z07 Process
    
     - A review of consistency checks has been added to the Z07 process.  
       Before a Z07 transmission is sent to the HEC (either during the
       batch process or in response to a query), the patient data must pass
       a list of required consistency checks.  If any of the checks fail,
       the Z07 message will not be sent to the HEC.  A table of the Z07   
       consistency checks can be found in the DG_5_3_P653_SADT_UM.pdf 
       document which is available for download. (See the FTP instructions
       in the Documents and Retrieval section below).
    
     - At the completion of the Z07 batch process, a bulletin is sent to 
       the mail group defined in the INCONSISTENCY EDIT field of the MAS
       PARAMETERS file with the number of Z07 messages that were not sent
       due to inconsistent data.
    
     - Modifications were made to the Inconsistent Data Elements Report to
       list all inconsistencies that prevented the Z07 message from being
       sent.
    
     - A new option was added, Z07 Build Consistency Check [DG Z07
       CONSISTENCY CHECK].  This option may be run for a selected patient
       to check if any inconsistent data would prevent a Z07 message from
       being sent to the HEC.
  
     - A new Integration Agreement, DBIA 5012, was added to allow routines
       in the Income Verification Match (IVM) package to read, update and
       delete records in the INCONSISTENT DATA file #38.5.
  
  5. VistA will share Eligibility/Enrollment Confidential Address
     
     - Logic has been added to share Confidential Address 
       (Eligibility/Enrollment type only) with the HEC.  Confidential
       Address changes will be shared only if the Confidential Address has
       Eligibility/Enrollment as an active category at the time of change.
    
     - Modifications were made to the HL7 Z07 message builder to include 
       Confidential Address fields in the PID segment.
    
     - When ESR is activated it will file the Confidential Address changes,
       HEC Legacy will not.
