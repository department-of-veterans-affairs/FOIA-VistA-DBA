Description: 
============

  Oncology Component
  ==================
   
   This is a new component for Health Summary (Oncology, ONC).
   
   This component lists the patient and characteristics of cancer/tumors 
   found and diagnosed.  This includes cancer identification, date of 
   diagnosis, topography, status, histology, grade/differentiation, stage
   of disease at diagnosis, size of tumor, clinical codes (T, N, and M),
   clinical stage group, pathologic codes (T, N, and M), pathologic stage
   group, first course of treatment, non-cancer directed surgery, surgery
   of primary site, radiation, regional dose, radiation treatment volume,
   intent of radiation, radiation completion status, chemotherapy, 
   hormone therapy, immunotherapy, protocol eligibility status and 
   protocol participation.
 
  Lab Component
  =============
 
   Several sites have written TIU objects which use the Lab Component 
   data extraction routine GMTSLRSE.  The variable SEX is being reported
   as undefined at CHSET+10^GMPSLRSE:1.  This variable is required and 
   documented in the routines as required.  Rather than have multiple
   sites re-write the code for their TIU objects, it was simpler to 
   modify the extraction routine to set the variable SEX.
 
  Ad Hoc Component
  ================
 
   The Ad Hoc Health Summary for the GUI does not emulate the Ad Hoc Health
   Summary of List Manager and "roll and scroll."  This patch exports the
   Remote Procedure Calls to build the necessary arrays to have the user
   select Health Summary components/Selected items, so the GUI and "roll and
   scroll" Ad Hoc Health Summaries behave the same.
 
  Edit Type Structure
  ===================
 
   Users can not edit the Health Summary Type Structure using the menu item
   Create/Modify Health Summary Type.  The quit condition of the Health 
   Summary Componet edit loop has been changed to allow for the editing of
   occurrence and time limits.  (NOIS DUR-1199-32534, CHA-1199-32422, and
   FAV-1299-70029)

  INSTALLATION
  =============
    
  This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation
  will take less than two minutes.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set to see if any of the routines listed in 
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section pre-exist in the account and are 
       mapped.  If found, they should be removed from the mapped set
       at this time.
   
   3.  On the KIDS menu, under the INSTALLATION menu, use the
       following options: (when prompted for INSTALL NAME 
       enter GMTS*2.7*36)
  
         Print Transport Global                      optional
         Compare Transport Global to Current System  optional/recommended
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global        optional/recommended
         Backup a Transport Global                   optional/recommended
         Install Package(s)                          required for install
   
   4.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
       Install? YES//", respond "NO".
 
   5.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
       Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO".
   
   6.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they
       should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
       has run to completion.
   
   7.  The Post-Install routine GMTSP36 will install the Oncology 
       component in the Health Summary Component file (#142.1), the 
       GMTS HS ADHOC OPTION Heath Summary type (file #142,12) and 
       the PDX Data Segment file #(394.71).
 
   8.  Routine GMTSP36 (Post-Install) is automatically deleted during
       a install by KIDs.
