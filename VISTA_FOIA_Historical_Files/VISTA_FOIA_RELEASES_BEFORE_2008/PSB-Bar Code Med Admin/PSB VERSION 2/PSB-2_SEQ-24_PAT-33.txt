Subject: SCHEDULE IVP/IVPB ERROR NOTIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Problem: NOIS SAJ-0803-71312
 An IV Piggyback order with a Schedule Type of Continuous that has Admin 
 times (i.e., Q12H with admin times of 0800-2000) and a frequency set to
 null, does not display on the IVP/IVPB Medication Tab of the Graphical User 
 Interface (GUI) Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Virtual Due List. 
 The same problem occurs for the Due List [PSBO DL] option. The VDL and the 
 Due List [PSBO DL] option also do not generate a Due List Error Notification
 message.
 
 Corrective Action:
 The Due List [PSBO DL] option, and the VDL will generate a Due List 
 Error Notification message for IV Piggyback medication orders with a 
 Schedule Type of Continuous that have Admin times, and A frequency set to 
 null. The  Due List [PSBO DL] option, and the VDL will generate a Due 
 List Error Notification message for orders with Schedule Type of Continuous 
 that are Unit Dose and IV Piggyback orders that have schedules names in the 
 format of administration times but the Admin times do not exist on the 
 order (i.e., schedule = 1200-1600 admin times = NULL).
