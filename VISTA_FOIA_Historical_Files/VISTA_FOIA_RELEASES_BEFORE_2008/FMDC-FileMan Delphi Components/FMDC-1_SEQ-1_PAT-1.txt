  This patch provides updates for the FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC). FMDC
  is used by developers to access VA FileMan data from client RPC
  Broker-based applications.
   
  This patch provides the following enhancements and fixes to FMDC:
   
  - Delphi 4 support is now provided (in addition to Delphi 3).
  - Source code is now provided for the FMDC components.
  - You can now derive custom components based on the FMDC components.
    Changes include making most procedures and functions protected instead
    of private, and referring to components by type rather than name.
  - NOIS issue LOM-0799-60075 is corrected (server side error due to a
    string length problem).
  - FMCheckBox components' display of retrieved null values as grayed-out
    checked values is corrected. They are now displayed as unchecked. An
    invalid non-null text value will still appear as the grayed-out checked
    value.
    
  THIS SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE COMPONENTS.
  WHILE THE SOURCE CODE HAS BEEN PROVIDED, IT SHOULD NOT BE ALTERED
  DIRECTLY.  IF AN ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IS NEEDED, DERIVE A COMPONENT
  BASED ON AN EXISTING COMPONENT INSTEAD, TO PROVIDE THAT FUNCTIONALITY. IF
  YOU THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO A WIDE AUDIENCE, THEN SEND A SAMPLE TO
  TSOPENVISTA@MED.VA.GOV.
   
  While this patch only provides code changes for developer's client
  workstations, a build also is included for the server side so that the
  patch number will appear in the package file. This build should be
  installed on the server simply to insure that the patch is noted as
  installed.
   
  The software distribution includes:
