Subject: SUPERVISOR/LEAD FIELD NOT UPDATED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains the fix necessary to remove the 
 SUPERVISOR/LEAD INDICATOR (#41) field, if necessary, based on the 
 Employee Occupation Series & Title code that is downloaded from Central
 PAID. After this patch is installed, the SUPERVISOR/LEAD INDICATOR(#41)
 field in the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) file, will not be populated if the 
 employee is no longer in a supervisory position.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1.    ASH-0703-30541/HD55400   Supervisor/Lead Field not updated
       
       Problem:
       -------
       When employees are changed from a supervisory or 'lead' position
       the supervisor/lead indicator field in file 450 is not removed.
       When we look at the employee's record through the PAID option
       Employee Inquiry, no supervisory/lead indicator displays.
       However, if we look at file 450, the lead indicator is still in
       the file. This is causing problems in the Education Package, 
       external application TEMPO, etc. that pull the information from 
       file 450.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       Routine PRSDUTIL was corrected to remove the supervisor/lead 
       indicator if the employee is no longer in a lead position 
       when the Employee Occupation Series & Title is downloaded.
