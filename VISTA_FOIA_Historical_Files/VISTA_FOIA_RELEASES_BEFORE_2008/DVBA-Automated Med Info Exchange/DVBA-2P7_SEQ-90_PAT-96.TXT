Description:
============

  Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation &
  Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) Phase II provides VistA updates
  necessary to support the new Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam
  template functionality implemented during Phase I of the CAPRI
  CPWM project.
  
  The goal of the CAPRI CPWM project is to implement the current
  Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) C&P exam worksheets
  in an electronic format that will upload exam results into Text
  Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to Computerized
  Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
  CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
  Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*91.  This CAPRI GUI
  version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
  the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
  exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
  Please refer to the user guide for further information on CAPRI CPWM.
