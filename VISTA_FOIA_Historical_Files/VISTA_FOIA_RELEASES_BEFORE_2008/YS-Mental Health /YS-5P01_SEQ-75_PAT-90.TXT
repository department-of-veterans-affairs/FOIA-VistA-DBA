Description:
============

 Recent changes in the Clozapine protocol require changes to the Clozapine 
 Roll Up software.  Originally, all Clozapine prescriptions were limited 
 to 7 days.  Renewals and refills were not allowed.  In addition, the 
 Clozapine reporting software automatically discontinued any patient if 
 the patient's prescription was over 28 days old.  This was to prevent a 
 patient from being issued medication on an expired prescription.  The 
 revised Clozapine protocol allows for a monthly prescription as well as 
 weekly and bi-weekly.  The patient is now automatically discontinued if 
 the issue date for the most recent prescription is greater than 56 days 
 in the past.
  
 The weekly roll-up creates a report that is sent to the local G.PSOCLOZ 
 mail group.  This report lists the patients reported to the national 
 database along with an indicator showing whether or not Lab and RX data 
 were transmitted.  This report has been updated to show the date of the 
 most recent WBC (White Blood Count) and Neutrophil Count along with the 
 date of the most recent Clozapine prescription.  Mental Health and 
 Pharmacy personnel responsible for prescribing and dispensing Clozapine 
 should be made aware of this mail group and given the opportunity to join.
  
 NEW OPTION:
 ==========
 The Link Multiple Tests to Clozapine [CLOZAPINE MULTI TEST LINK] option 
 must be assigned to the person or persons responsible for ensuring that 
 the appropriate data is in place to validate Clozapine testing data.  
 This is usually the Laboratory ADPAC.
  
 This option will ask for the local laboratory name that equates to the 
 following seven common test names
  
 White Blood Cell Count
 Absolute Neutrophil Count
 Neutrophil %
 Segs  (Percent)
 Bands (Percent)
 Segs  (Absolute Count)
 Bands (Absolute Count)
  
 You will also be asked to fill in the reporting format for each test.  
 Most sites report WBC and Neutrophil results in K/unit format (K/cc or 
 K/cu mm or K/mm-3 or K/mL). For example, WBC equals 5.1.  However, some 
 report results as discrete units. For example, WBC equals 5100.  This 
 field will allow the site to specify how results are reported.  Entries 
 that report in a percentage (such as Neutrophil %, Segs %, and Bands %) 
 should use "Percentage".
  
 You may input as many names from the local laboratory definition for each 
 of these tests as needed.  Remember that the laboratory may have designed 
 special names for specific test equipment, specific test locations, or 
 specific test conditions, such as manual counts.  
  
 In fact, if your facility has Clozapine patients with blood samples drawn 
 and tested on a fee-basis at other CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
 Amendments) approved labs, it is extremely important for your Laboratory 
 have tests to accept manual input of these tests.  
  
 Therefore, you should involve laboratory managers or ADPAC (Automated 
 Data Processing Application Coordinator) in selection of these names - 
 both to define the test names currently in use and to create the 
 provision for manual entry of data.  Please be certain every possible 
 local laboratory name that represents these tests is entered that relates 
 to each of the seven test names above.  Pharmacy dispense will be 
 prevented unless the program can find the needed test results under one 
 of names you identify as an equivalent for each of the seven tests.
  
 Security Key: The YSCL AUTHORIZED Security Key is new with this patch.  
  This key must be assigned to each provider authorized to dispense 
  Clozapine.

 The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) uses White Blood Cell Count and 
 Absolute Neutrophil Count as the definitive tests to verify for Clozapine 
 use, however your lab may report your data under any of the names you 
 enter into these lists.  If the WBC and ANC are not directly available, 
 ANC will be calculated from the other data available and presented to 
 Pharmacy (and CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System) during a later 
 revision) at the time of dispense and used to evaluate the safety under 
 FDA limits.  Only the most recent WBC will be accepted, and the date and 
 time stamp of the Neutrophil count must match the date and time stamp of 
 the WBC.
  
  
 WHITE BLOOD CELL  (WBC)
  
 For reference  "White Blood Cell Count" is a portion of the total blood 
 content and the sum total of two different kinds of cells - 
  
          AGRANULOCYTES - those cells which do not have granules
          that absorb a stain.  These cells are subdivided
          into Lymphocytes and Monocytes. 
  
          GRANULOCYTES  -- those cells which contain granules
          that absorb a stain.  These cells are subdivided
          into Neutrophils, Basophils, and Eosinophils.  
  
 Both Agranulocytes and Granulocytes are part of the Total White Blood 
 Cell Count.  Therefore, the total WBC is the sum of five different types 
 of cells.  
  
 WBC as well as its five components are usually expressed as the total 
 number of cells in a cubic centimeter of blood (cc) or cubic millimeter 
 (cu mm or mm-3)or milliliters (mL).  
  
 WBC usually falls with a range between 4000 and 11,000 but fluctuates for 
 a number of medical reasons.  For brevity, WBC results may be divided by 
 1000 and presented as K/cc or K/cu mm or K/mm-3 or K/mL
  
  
 The five components are similarly expressed as number of the same type OR 
 as a percentage of the total WBC.  
  
 The sum of counts of the five components of should equal the total WBC OR 
 the sum of the percentages of the five components should equal 100%
  
 This test is sometimes also referred to as "Leukocyte Count" 
  
  
 Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)
  
 The Absolute Neutrophil Count is the total number of Neutrophil cells in 
 the total WBC count.  The other GRANULOCYTE cells - Basophils and 
 Eosinophils (see White Blood Cell Count above) - are not included in this 
 number.  Therefore - a test titled GRANULOCYTES - may not produce the 
 desired result as it may include Basophils and Eosinophils.
  
 Since the ANC is a portion of the WBC, it is only valid if it is 
 traceable to the WBC sample drawn at the same date and time.  
  
 ANC is a count and not a percentage - expressed as WBC with the total 
 number of cells in a cubic centimeter of blood (cc) or cubic millimeter 
 (cu mm or mm-3)or milliliters (mL).  Again, this number may be divided by 
 a thousand for brevity.  
  
 The Absolute Neutrophil Count generally ranges from 1600 to 7700 / but it 
 can ever exceed the WBC count.  
  
 This test can also be knows as polymorphonuclear cells or PMN's. 
  
  
 Neutrophil Percent  (Neut%)
  
 The Neutrophil Percent is the portion of the total WBC and that is 
 composed of Neutrophil cells, excluding all agranulocytes and other 
 granulocytes.  This number is usually between 40% and 70%, but fluctuates 
 for many medical reasons.  
  
 Since it is reported as a portion of the total WBC, it is only valid if 
 it is traceable to the WBC sample drawn at the same date and time.  
  
 Neut% is commonly obtained by automatic testing equipment to represent 
 the Neutrophil content in the blood.  
  
 Neut% is a percentage and not a count - reported in the portion of the 
 WBC.  It can be converted into an Absolute Neutrophil Count in the 
 following formula (Neutrophil% / 100) X WBC count).  
  
 The Neutrophil Percent generally ranges from 37% to 80% and should never 
 exceed 90% of the total WBC count unless special medical conditions are 
 present.  
  
  
 SEGS  & BANDS  
  
 The WBC/Granulocyte/Neutrophil cell type can be further subdivided into 
 two types.  Mature neutrophils are called SEGS.  Immature neutrophils 
 called BANDS also circulate in the blood until they mature into SEGS.  
 The sum of SEGS and BANDS is equal to the ANC of a give WBC count.  
  
 SEGS and BANDS may be reported as a count, expressed in cc, mm-3, cu mm, 
 or mL.  A preceding K indicates the number has been divided by 1000.  
  
 When SEGS and BANDS are reported as a number, the sum total of SEGS and 
 BANDS equals the total Neutrophil Count (ANC)  NOTE that the program 
 needs an identifying test for both SEGS and BANDS.  Reporting SEGS 
 without a parallel result from BANDS will result in an error condition 
 that may prevent Pharmacy dispense.  
  
 This number generally ranges between 1600 and 7700 / cu mm.  It should 
 never exceed 90% of the total WBC except under special circumstances. 
  
 SEGS and BANDS may be reported as a PERCENTAGE of the total WBC.  
 Therefore the total number of neutrophils (ANC) in a give WBC is = total 
 WBC  X  (% Segs  + % Bands).  This calculation will be performed by the 
 Pharmacy patch to obtain and ANC when necessary
  
 The sum total of SEGS% and BANDS% can never exceed 100.
