Subject: UNABLE TO FINISH IMO COMPLEX ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Pending complex orders cannot be verified when the complex order is also
  an Inpatient Orders for Outpatients (IMO) order. This patch corrects this
  issue by allowing the verification of complex IMO orders if the IMO
  functionality is active and the clinic is a valid IMO clinic. 
  
  Complex Inpatient orders may only be created if the Inpatient Orders for
  Outpatients (IMO) functionality has been activated.  The same criteria 
  used to determine if a simple IMO order may be selected for finishing in 
  Inpatient Medications will be used for Complex Orders; for instance, if 
  the clinic associated with the order is not a valid IMO clinic, the order
  may not be finished in Inpatient Medications.
