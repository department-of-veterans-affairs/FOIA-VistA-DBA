Description:
============

 This patch adds two more aggregate reports to the Outcomes module of the
 Spinal Cord Dysfunction (SCD) package, namely an annual evaluation
 aggregate report and a continuum of care aggregate report.  These reports
 are similar to the aggregate reports for inpatient and outpatient
 rehabilitation.
  
 Additional enhancements contained in this patch are:
  
         1. An "Inquire" option has been created for the SCD (SPINAL CORD) 
 REGISTRY file (#154).  The name of this option is "Inquire to a 
 Registry Patient" [SPN REG INQ].
  
         2. Text has been inserted in the Outcomes module to remind users 
 that the first record type in a new episode of care for a patient should
 be an ASIA.  This will allow the patient to be included (and properly
 classified) when running any of the four aggregate outcomes reports.
  
  
  This patch also addresses the following NOIS calls:
  
  NOIS Calls.
  ===========
  
  1) NOIS # SDC-1003-61665.  The Clinical Information option (SPNL CLINICAL
 REGISTRATION MOD) allowed adding and editing of patients even if they were
 not in the SCD (SPINAL CORD) REGISTRY file (#154). This has been fixed.
  
  2) NOIS # TAM-1003-31660.  An "Undefined" error may occur in report 
 SCI/SCD Admissions [SPN PRINT ADMISSIONS] if a global delete is done on 
 an entry in the Patient Movement file (#405).  This has been fixed.
  
  3) NOIS # HWH-1003-41661.  The filter "OUTCOMES" in the SCD FILTER file 
 (#154.92) is an extraneous, non-functional filter.  It has been removed.

  General Information.
  ====================
  
 This patch should be installed into your production UCI.  It can be
 installed at anytime.  You may experience pauses during installation, but
 install time should not take more than five minutes. No options need to be
 disabled.  An environment check will be performed to ensure that the
 installing site has installed SPN*2.0*20.
  
  
  Installation Instructions.
  ==========================
  
  Users of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction package may remain online during
  installation.
  
  This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:
  
    1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build
         onto your system.
    2) Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
         Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
         the mapped set at this time.
    3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option
         'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all
          routines have the correct checksums.
    4) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option 'Install
          Package(s)'.  Select the package 'SPN*2.0*21' and proceed with
          install.
    5) It is recommended that you answer 'NO' to each of the following
          questions:
             a) 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
                 Install?'
             b) 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
             c) 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
                 Protocols?'
    6) If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
             returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
             completion.
