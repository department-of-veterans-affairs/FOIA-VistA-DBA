Subject: M10 & M11 check digit scheme

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch solves the following problems:
    NOIS ISF-1097-61155: The M10 and M11 check digit algorithms do not
                         comply with the HL7 Standard.
   
 The two extrinsic functions, $$M10^HLFNC(X,HLECDE) and
 $$M11^HLFNC(X,HLECDE) have been corrected to bring them into compliance
 with the HL7 Standard.
  
 NOTE:  It is highly unlikely that an interface with a commercial system
 or an Interface Engine will break due to this fix unless they deliberately
 modified their system. However, if this is the case, the code that
 originally called M10 or M11 can be modified to call the new tags:
    
 $$OLDM10^HLFNC(X,HLECDE) 
 or
 $$OLDM11^HLFNC(X,HLECDE)

  ==========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
    2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
        the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
