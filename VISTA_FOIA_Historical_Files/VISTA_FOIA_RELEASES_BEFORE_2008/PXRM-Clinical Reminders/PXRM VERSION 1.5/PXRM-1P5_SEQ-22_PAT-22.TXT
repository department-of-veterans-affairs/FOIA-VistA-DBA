Subject: CORRECTION TO PXRM*1.5*12 TECHNICAL MANUAL

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 A potential problem has been identified in the information provided in the 
 Technical manual for PXRM*1.5*12. For the entries in the pharmacy package 
 that could not be indexed because of bad data, the Clinical Reminders team 
 initially recommended  entering some code (identified as ZZPSORXG in the 
 manual) to fix the bad data. Since the release of PXRM*1.5*12, it has been 
 determined that the code provided could cause problems with the pharmacy 
 package if a typographical error in typing in the code was encountered. 
  
 Therefore, at this time, Clinical Reminders is removing this reference from a 
 revised version of the technical manual that will be posted to both the 
 anonymous directory and the VDL. This revised version will not illustrate 
 the code nor the ZZPSORXG routine. At this time, OI is advising sites to 
 not attempt to enter the code displayed as ZZPSORXG or if the code has been 
 entered not to execute it. If sites need help in cleaning up the pharmacy 
 data reported in error messages when the Reminders Index is built, a NOIS 
 should be entered to the pharmacy package.
