Subject: NOT ABLE TO SELECT NON-VA MEDS FOR WARD STOCK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOIS CLE-1004-40164. When using Automatic Replenishment/Ward Stock option
 Enter/Edit On-Demand Request (80 column) [PSGW ON-DEMAND EDIT], the user 
 tried to select an item marked only for Non-VA Med (X) and it was
 non-selectable.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 Problem:  CLE-1004-40164 
 ======================
 When a user of the Automatic Replenishment/Ward Stock selects option 
 Enter/Edit On-Demand Request (80 column) [PSGW ON-DEMAND EDIT],
 and then at the 'Select ITEM:' prompt inputs a drug that is marked only as 
 a Non-VA Med (stored as an 'X' in file 50 PSDRUG subscript 2 piece 3), the 
 item is non-selectable. This problem started after the implementation of 
 Non-VA meds.
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Made modifications to $Select statements in routines PSGWOD2, PSGWSTKI 
 and PSGWUTL that check which available packages this drug is marked for 
 usage. The modification now includes checking for an 'X'. This now allows 
 selection of drugs that are marked as only 'X' (Non-VA Med). Also, modified 
 routine PSGWCAD3 to exclude 'X' (Non-VA Med) just as it currently excludes 
 O, U, I and N. Can use option Stock Items - Enter/Edit [PSGW EDIT AOU 
 STOCK] to verify Ward Stock item(s) selected in testing session did get 
 stored in an AOU.

 =========================
 Although this patch may be loaded with users on the system, it is advisable
 to install it during non-peak hours.  
  
 The install will take less than 10 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  [Note: TEXT
      PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text
      only.]
  
  2.  Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...

                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter PSGW*2.3*17) 
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSGW*2.3*17.

      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
