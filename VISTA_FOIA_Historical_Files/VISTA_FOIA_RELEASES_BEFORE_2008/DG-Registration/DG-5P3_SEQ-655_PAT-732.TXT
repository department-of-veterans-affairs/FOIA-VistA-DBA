Subject: POW STATUS NOT TRANSFERRING TO ID CARD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 There are two issues associated with this patch.
 Issue 1: VIC
 It was discovered that a Veteran's POW status is not being uploaded 
 onto the Veteran's ID card if the POW status is the Veteran's primary 
 eligibility.
  
 Issue 2: MAS 
 The treating specialty listed on the DG INPATIENT ROSTER report is being
 truncated to 14 characters causing confusion for several of the new
 specialties that are ambiguous at that length.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD 153957   POW STATUS
  
   Problem:
   ========
   Veterans who have a primary eligibility of Prisoner of War are
   receiving Veteran ID cards that do not show the POW status.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The routine, DGQEUT1, will be modified to look at both the primary 
   eligibility and the secondary eligibility when checking for a
   veteran's POW status.
  
 2) HD 152791   Treating specialties are truncated in output from DG 
                INPATIENT ROSTER option.
  
   Problem:
   ========
   With the addition and use of the new treating specialties, they are
   being truncated on the Inpatient Roster causing confusion.
  
   Solution:
   =========
   The routine DGOINPT1 will be modified to use the shortened synonym
   for the Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) treating specialty codes
   that need more clarification than just the first 14 characters.
