Description: 
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch is being done in coordination with and in conjunction
  with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Federal Health
  Information Exchange (FHIE) Enhancement Project, which shall 
  include current and historical data feeds on selected DOD data
  types for active duty and retired military members.
  
  This patch also addresses a few CPRS report related NOIS's as
  described below.
  
  Three reports are added with this patch that will become
  available on the DOD menu within the CPRS Reports Tab,
  and allow remote data to be pulled from the FHIE database.
    They are:
      Expanded ADT
      Discharge Summary
      Cytology
  
  This patch adds and modifies entries to the OE/RR Reports file
  (#101.24) for several DOD reports.
  
  WARNING: Items in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) with entry
  numbers greater than 999 are reserved, and should not be used
  for local enhancements.  If you have any local changes to items
  in this number range, that you want to keep, move them to an
  internal number <1000.  This patch will delete these entries 
  numbers before proceeding with the install.
    
  Changes to entries in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24)
  are as follows:

  The addition of ORCV IMMUNIZATIONS will allow immunizations to
  be displayed on the Cover Sheet.  To take advantage of this
  enhancement, you will have to 'swap out' one of the existing
  Cover Sheet components in favor of the immunization component.
  The instructions for doing this are as follows:

  IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE:
  If you don't have System level parameters setup
  for ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST, then now would be a good time
  to add them, since future exports of this parameter would
  overwrite any changes made at the Package level.  You can do
  this by simply copying over the Package level values
  into the System level values.  The Cover Sheet can only
  handle 8 components, so don't try to create more than
  this, or your users will start getting 'out of bounds'
  errors, when they access the Cover Sheet.

  ============================================================
  
  The change to the new ORRPW DOD entries was done so that the
  DOD reports could be distinguished and allow different 
  parameter settings than the non-DOD reports. 
  
  This patch also fixes a problem in the display of available
  remote sites on the blue 'Remote Data' button in CPRS.  
  Department of Defense was not showing up in the list, when
  the parameter ORWRP CIRN SITES ALL was turned off and
  the individual site #200 Austin was selected in the ORWRP
  CIRN SITES parameter.  Site #200 is the site designated to
  get DoD data (FHIE).
  
  This patch fixes a problem where the wrong variable was being
  used to identify which option was invoking the Radiology
  report.  The variable was used for date range parameter defaults.
  This would have only been a problem for sites using the CAPRI
  software, which would have been using the CPRS parameters,
  instead of the CAPRI defaults.
