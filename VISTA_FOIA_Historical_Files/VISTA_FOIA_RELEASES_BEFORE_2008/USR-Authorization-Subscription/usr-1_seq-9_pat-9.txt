Subject: MISSING SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 The Authorization Subscription Utility (ASU) uses the SIGNATURE BLOCK
 PRINTED NAME as the display name for a user. Since a user can change
 their own SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME, it is possible that this field
 can be left empty. When it is empty no user name is displayed in the
 USER CLASS MEMBERS display under the LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS Option.
 To prevent this problem the display name for a user will now be obtained
 from the .01 field of the NEW PERSON file (#200).
  
 A search for a missing SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME will now be added. If
 it is missing, the user name will be followed by (?SBPN) and a message
 will be displayed in the List Manager message window, explaining ?SBPN
 means that the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME is missing.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1. Routines:  USRLS, USRMLST, USRULST
 The function SIGNAME^USRLS was changed to return the .01 field of file
 200 and to check for a missing SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME. If it is
 missing then (?SBPN) is appended to the returned name.  USRMLST and
 USRULST were changed so that if a user name contains ?SBPN then VALMSG
 is set to display a message describing what ?SBPN means.
