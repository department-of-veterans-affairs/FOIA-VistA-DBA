Subject: FIX ERRORS WITH PRCSSUB RPT & PRCSRI GENERATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects two issues:
 The first issue involves a FRAMESTACK error in running the BOC Totals
 report [PRCSSUB RPT] when the number of obligations in a selected quarter
 approaches 3,000.  
 The second issue occurs when running the option Generate Requests From
 Repetitive Item List Entry [PRCSRI GENERATE].  An Undefined Error occurs
 when the default device for the station selected for the given type of
 order (example:  Supply) is either out-of-date or is non-existent.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD55658     NYH-1104-10249 Problem Printing BOC Total Report
      
 Problem:
 --------
 When users run the option BOC Totals [PRCSSUB RPT] and the FY Quarter 
 they select has a large number of obligations to process, somewhere 
 between 2,500-3,000, a FRAMESTACK error occurs and the user is logged-off 
 the system.  If the obligation amount is lower, there is no issue with 
 the report.   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Made a coding change to kill a variable that was being created and never 
 killed for each new obligation until the STACK was full.
  
 Routine:  PRCSP1C1
  
      
 2. HD65794     Receiving Undefined Error
      
 Problem:
 --------           
 When a station's default device, defined in the Admin. Activity Site 
 Parameter file (411) for a specific type of transaction (ex. Supply) is 
 defined as a device that is either out-of-service or is no longer defined 
 in the device file, an Undefined error occurs while running the Generate
 Requests From Repetitive Item List Entry [PRCSRI GENERATE] option.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Added code to check the status of the variable which gets cleared when
 the device is not operable.  If the device is not correct, a message is
 displayed to the user:
  
 "There is an error with the default device defined in file 411."
 "Please contact IRM before proceeding."
  
 The processing of the request is then halted with a list of already 
 processed items.
