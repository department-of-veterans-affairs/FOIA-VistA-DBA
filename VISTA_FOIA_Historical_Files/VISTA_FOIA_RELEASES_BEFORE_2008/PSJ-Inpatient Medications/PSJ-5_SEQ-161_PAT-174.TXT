Subject: PATIENT PROFILE / Q5MINUTES SCHEDULE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1.  Remedy Ticket HD124156
     The report [Patient Profile (Extended)], menu option [PSJ EXTP], does 
     not display the index numbers of complex orders correctly.
     
     The problem appears as the report displays each individual pending
     complex order with an index number which can be selected for viewing.
  
     This patch is designed to display the entire complex order with a 
     single index number and display the full complex order when that
     number is selected for view.
  
 2.  Remedy Ticket HD127723
     The problem describes how certain schedules are not being handled
     correctly as the order is finished. 
     
     If schedules such as Q5MINUTES are ordered in CPRS and finished in the
     backdoor option [PSJ OE], other schedules such as Q5MINUTES PRN are 
     incorrectly being displayed by the matching function during the finishing 
     process.  For example, this function would also erroneously display 
     Q2H EVEN and Q2H ODD if the original schedule was ordered as Q2H.
 
     The finish process will also not accept the user's selection when 
     prompted to select one of these multiple schedules.  This patch makes 
     the correction to prevent the multiple schedule prompts where there 
     should be an exact schedule match.
