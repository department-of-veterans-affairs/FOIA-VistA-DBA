Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 This patch corrects the following issue:
  If a user is doing a look up on the NEW PERSON(#200) file and entered a 
 zero followed by a number or two zeros followed by a number it was 
 possible by entering enough returns to display another user's Social 
 Security Number(SSN) in violation of the Privacy Act.  For example:
  
 USER INquiry example:
  
 Select NEW PERSON NAME: 02
      1   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      2   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]    
      3   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]        
      4   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]      
      5   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
 Press <RETURN> to see more, '^' to exit this list, OR
 CHOOSE 1-5: 
      6   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      7   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      8   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      9   [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      10  [Last 4]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
 Press <RETURN> to see more, '^' to exit this list, OR
 CHOOSE 1-10: 
      11  [VA #]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]    
      12  [VA #]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      13  [VA #]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      14  [VA #]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      15  [VA #]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
 Press <RETURN> to see more, '^' to exit this list, OR
 CHOOSE 1-15: 
      16  [a full ssn]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      17  [a full ssn]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]  
      18  [a full ssn]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]    
      19  [a full ssn]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]    
      20  [a full ssn]  [a name]     [rest of Identifiers]       
 Press <RETURN> to see more, '^' to exit this list, OR
 CHOOSE 1-20: ^
  
 After the patch only the first 15 entries would display in the above 
 example.  Note this screen does not affect non-interactive look ups.
  
 Data Dictionary Change:
 =======================
 FILE SCREEN (SCR-node) : I $$SCR200^XUSER
  
 File Header Change:
 ===================
 ^VA(200,0)=NEW PERSON^200Is^[a number]^[a number]
  
 New Security Key:
 =================

  DESCRIPTION:   This security key will allow the user to enter all 9 
 digits of a New Person's Social Security Number(SSN) for look up on the
 NEW PERSON(#200) file.  Any user who does not hold this key, will not be
 allowed to use a 9 digit SSN lookup on the NEW PERSON(#200) file.
