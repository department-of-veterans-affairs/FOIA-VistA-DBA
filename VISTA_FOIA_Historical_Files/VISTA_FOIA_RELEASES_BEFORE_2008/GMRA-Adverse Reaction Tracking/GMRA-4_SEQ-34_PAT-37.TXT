 ----------------------------------------
  
  
 Patch GMRA*4*26 introduced remote data interoperability (RDI) 
 functionality so that remotely entered allergy data would be considered 
 when determining if an order check should be produced.
  
 Patch 26 only included functionality for pharmacy allergy order 
 checking.  This patch will expand the RDI functionality to include 
 remotely entered data when determining if there is a contrast media 
 allergy when ordering radiological procedures.
  
 Upon entering a radiological request that uses contrast, either from
 within the radiology package or within CPRS, an order check will be 
 displayed if there is contrast media allergy data on file either locally 
 or remotely.
  
 Patch OR*3*267 includes updates to enhance the order check display and 
 should be installed at the same time as this patch.  However, these 
 patches can be installed independently of each other without any adverse 
 effect.
