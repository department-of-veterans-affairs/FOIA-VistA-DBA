 This patch fixes the following problem(s):
  
 1) The Women's Health package displays the contents of the Clinical 
 History field (FILE 74, Field #400) of the Radiology/NM package if a 
 Women's Health procedure is linked to a Radiology/NM procedure (e.g., 
 mammogram). That field contains word-processing text. 
  
 Prior to Radiology/NM patch RA*5*27, upon creation of the FILE 74 entry, 
 the Radiology/NM package copied text into this field (FILE 74 Field #400) 
 from the CLINICAL HISTORY field (also field #400) of FILE 70. Users could 
 then edit the text that was copied into the FILE 74 entry.
  
 Radiology/NM patch RA*5*27, renames Field #400 in FILE 74 to ADDITIONAL
 CLINICAL HISTORY and no longer copies any text into this field when an 
 entry is created. The ADDITIONAL CLINICAL HISTORY field will contain only 
 text entered after the FILE 74 entry is created.
  
 This Women's Health patch will check the contents of Field #400 in FILE 
 70 and FILE 74. If they are different, the contents of both fields will 
 be displayed. If the contents are exactly the same, only one (FILE 74) 
 will be displayed. [ISH-1001-40568]
