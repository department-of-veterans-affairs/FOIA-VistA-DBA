Subject: HIPAA CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  The objective of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  (HIPAA) Confidential Communication Project is to develop and deploy 
  enhancements to the Veterans Health Information System and Technology 
  Architecture (VistA) software to comply with HIPAA rules for Confidential
  Communication 45 CFR 164.552. This patch will provide a means for a 
  patient to provide an alternative mailing address to be used for 
  confidential communication at a designated Veterans Administration (VA) 
  facility, communication of Protected Health Information (PHI) by 
  alternative means or alternative location.
  
  The following modifications are included in this patch to provide the 
  requested functionality:
  
  1. Add new fields to the PATIENT (#2) file to store the confidential
     address information.  The following new fields will be added:
  
     CONFIDENTIAL STREET [LINE 1]            (#.1411)
     CONFIDENTIAL STREET [LINE 2]            (#.1412)
     CONFIDENTIAL STREET [LINE 3]            (#.1413)
     CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS CITY               (#.1414)
     CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS STATE              (#.1415)
     CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS ZIP CODE           (#.1416)
     CONFIDENTIAL START DATE                 (#.1417)
     CONFIDENTIAL END DATE                   (#.1418)
     CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS ACTIVE?            (#.14105)
     CONFDIENTIAL ADDRESS COUNTY             (#.14111)
     CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS CATEGORY (#.141) will be added as a multiple
     valued field to store the correspondence types:
  
        CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS CATEGORY (#.01) 
        CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS ACTIVE   (#1)
  
  2.  The CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS CATEGORY field will be defined as a set of 
      codes and contain the following correspondence types:
  
        Eligibility/Enrollment
        Appointment/Scheduling 
        Co-payments/Veterans Billing
        Medical Records 
        All Others
  
  3.  Several Registration options have been modified to enter, edit and
      view the confidential communications address information.  They
      include:
  
          Eligibility Verification  [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION] 
          Load/Edit Patient Data    [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] 
          Preregister a Patient     [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]  
          Register a Patient        [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
          View Registration Data    [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
  
  4.  The post-initialization routine DG53489P will add a new entry to the 
      INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS (#38.6) file.  Conf. Address Data
      Incomplete element will be added as entry #63.  The inconsistency
      results if a Patient file entry with an active confidential address
      does not contain the first line of the street address, city, state,
      and zip code for the confidential address.
  
  5.  Modify the Patient Inquiry, [DG PATIENT INQUIRY] option to display 
      active confidential address information.  If no confidential 
      information is available for the patient or this information is
      inactive, 'No Confidential Address' will be displayed and the From/To
      field will display 'Not Applicable".
  
  6.  Active confidential address information will be displayed on the 1010
      and VBC forms.  The VBC Form By Admission Date, [DG VBC ADMISSION],
      VBC Form for Specific Patient, [DG VBC PATIENT], and 10/10 Print
      without New Registration, [DG REGISTRATION 10/10 REPRINT] options
      will be modified to print this information.
  
  7.  Modify the ADD entry point in the VADPT utility to return
      confidential address information.  VAPA("CD") is an optional input
      parameter set to an effective date in VA File Manager format to
      manipulate the active/inactive status  returned in the VAPA(12)
      node.  The indicator will reflect the active status as of the date
      specified or the current date if VAPA ("CD") is undefined or contains
      an invalid date.
  
      The following nodes will be added to the output array:
  
         VAPA(12)=Confidential Address Active indicator
         VAPA(13)=Confidential Street [Line 1]
         VAPA(14)=Confidential Street [Line 2]
         VAPA(15)=Confidential Street [Line 3]
         VAPA(16)=Confidential Address City
         VAPA(17)=Confidential Address State in internal^external format
         VAPA(18)=Confidential Address Zip Code in 5 or 9 digit format in 
                  internal^external format
         VAPA(19)=Confidential Address County in internal^external format
         VAPA(20)=Confidential Start Date in internal^external format
         VAPA(21)=Confidential End Date in internal^external format
         VAPA(22,n)=internal format^external format of the Confidential
                    Address Category^status (n=internal value)
