Subject: IMPLEMENTING LAB SUPPORT FOR HL PACKAGE NAMESPACING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*62 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 Patch LA*5.2*62 implements support for patch HL*1.6*91 NAMESPACE field
 (#16) in HL7 MESSAGE TEXT file (#772). The Laboratory HL7 clients
 Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) and CareVue will pass the
 namespace "LA" in the HL7 APIs that create messages or acknowledgements.
   
 During patch development, a software review identified the variable
 HLRESLT, returned by various HL package APIs, misspelled in routines
 LA7DVC and LA7DVM. The patch corrects the spelling of this variable.
 Additionally, these two routines referenced the variable VAIN(4) before
 the variable was initialized. This patch calls supported API INP^VADPT
 to initialize VAIN(4).

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 10 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
   6.  Perform the following steps if applicable:
       All Lab LEDI (LA7V*) related HL v1.6 LLPs should be shutdown.
       All CareVue related LLPs should be shutdown.
       Use the HL menu option Start/Stop Links [HL START] to shutdown
       these LLPs if they are running.
  
  
   7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*62'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'YES'.
  
       All LA7V* and LA7D* protocols should be placed out of service during
       the install. This can be accomplished by answering the KIDS install
       questions:
  
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
         YES//', choose 'YES'.
  
         Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': <RET>
         Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': LA7V*
         Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': LA7D*
  
  
  
   8. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  Note: Routine LA62 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
  
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
  
 1. Restart any LA7V* and CareVue HL v1.6 LLP's shutdown as part of the
 patch installation process. Use the Start LLP [HL START] option to
 restart LA7V* and CareVue HL v1.6 LLP's.
