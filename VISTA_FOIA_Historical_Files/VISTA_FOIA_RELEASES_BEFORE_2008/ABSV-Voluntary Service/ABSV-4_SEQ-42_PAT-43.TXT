Subject: VERSION 3.09 CHANGES

Category: 
  - Input Template
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is an informational patch notifying the sites of new and updated
 functionality contained in the V3.09 release of the Voluntary Service System
 (VSS) software.  An addendum to the Voluntary Service System (VSS) User Manual
 is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the IO Field
 Offices.
 
 
 =========================
 NEW/CHANGED FUNCTIONALITY
 =========================
 
 Version 3.09 of the Voluntary Service System software contains enhancements
 for Donations and corrects some Remedy Tickets.  Version 3.09 includes:
 
 1.  Add/Edit Donation
 ---------------------
 The Add/Edit Donation option has been redesigned to make it less confusing
 when inputting donor or donation information.  The option will be split into
 two screens.  On the first screen the user will be able to select/add/edit a
 donor.  Once a donor is selected, the user will be directed to the second
 screen where they can add/edit a donation for the donor selected on the first
 screen.
 
 Other miscellaneous changes to the Add/Edit Donation option include:
 a. Check or Cash donation "requires" a GPF #. "None" should either be grayed
 out or omitted. If donation is Item or Activity no GPF box should appear, or
 the default should be "None".
 
 b. Add new fields for the Family Contact address.  The fields to be added are
 Family Contact Address, Family Contact City, Family Contact State, and Family
 Contact Zip.  On the user interface, place the fields next to the Family
 Contact field.
 
 c. When sorting a donation by date on the Select Donation Screen 1, search the
 list of donations by date in descending order, not alphabetical order.  On the
 opening screen, list the donations by date in descending order.
 
 d. Currently the Local Branch field is tied to each Donation.  This field
 needs to be moved to the Organization.  This will require the Add/Edit
 Donation screen to be changed.  It will also require a database conversion to
 move the data from the existing donation table to the donor table.
 
 e. Leave the Acknowledgement Date blank allowing the user to enter it.  The
 Acknowledgement Date will automatically be set to the date the donation letter
 is first printed.  If the Acknowledgement Date is set and the letter is
 reprinted, the Acknowledgement Date will not change.  The user can use this
 date to track donations that need to have letters printed.  For 3.09, remove
 the screen on the Acknowledgement Date allowing the user to enter any date.
 
 
 2.  Merge Donor
 ---------------
 A new option has been included named Merge Donor.  The Merge Donor option will
 allow the user to transfer all donations from a selected donor to another
 donor and delete the duplicate donor.  This option will allow sites to clean
 up their site's Donor list.
 
 There will be an automatic database cleanup that will merge duplicate donor
 records (duplicate donors records being records that have all donor
 information being exactly the same).  This cleanup will occur just prior to
 the 3.09 release.
 
 
 3.  Donation Receipt and Memo Changes
 -------------------------------------
 The following changes have been made to the donation receipt and memo in
 version 3.09:
 a. After entering a donation by an 'Other Group' and 'Other Group &
 Individual' the Other Group name does not appear on the Receipt or Memo.  This
 is reported in Remedy Ticket 58399.
 
 b. When it is a split donation, list all the GPF's not just the word multiple.
 
 c. Local branch does not print on receipt or memo.
 
 d. Change the word Description to Remarks.
 
 e. All Remarks should print on Receipt and Memo.
 
 f. Change the Receipt and Memo so that the Mail Stop is displayed versus 135. 
 If no Mail Stop is entered, display 135.  This is an enhancement reported in
 Remedy Ticket 58557.
 
 g. Display the Donation Id.
 
 
 4.  Donation Search
 -------------------
 The following changes have been made to the donation search in version 3.09:
 a. On Selecting Data for display, the Description needs to be changed to
 Remarks.
 
 b. Add the field Designation to the list of Data to be displayed.
 
 c. Add Family Contact Address, City, State, and Zip Code.
 
 d. Add Cookies to retain previously selected Print Fields.
 
 
 5.  Thank You Letters
 ---------------------
 Version 3.09 includes five different types of Thank You Letters for Donations.
 The letters include: In Memory Of, Family Contact, Check or Cash Donation,
 Activity, and Item.  The user interface for generating the letters allows the
 user to screen donations by date range or acknowledgement date.  The user has
 the option to print a letter for a single donation or multiple donations.
 
 
 6.  Remedy Tickets Included in Version 3.09
 -------------------------------------------
 a. Remedy Ticket 55520, Fixes Blank Screen For VS26 Report.
 
 b. Remedy Ticket 55526 and 57878, Count on New Volunteers Report.   The count
 on the New Volunteers Report will count unique volunteers by the
 SSN/Identifier.  The report will also include a subtotal of volunteer counts
 by organizations.
 
 c. Remedy Ticket 55554, Counts for Youths in Labels and Alpha Report.  The
 count on the Alphabetical Report will count Youths using the current date the
 report is run to calculate the age.  The version 3.08 report used the last day
 of the fiscal year to compute the age of a volunteer causing the youth count
 to be different on the Labels and Alphabetical Report.  In version 3.09, the
 counts should be the same.
 
 d. Remedy Ticket 55583, Add Volunteer Without Combination Code.  Volunteers
 can no longer be added without a combination code.
 
 e. Remedy Ticket 55589, Voluntary Daily Review Locks Up.  The header for the
 date is expanded on the report.
 
 f. Remedy Ticket 55618, VS01 Parser Error Fixed.
 
 g. Remedy Tickets 55630, 55822, 56044, and 62794, Donor/Donation Changes fixed
 with a rewrite of the Add/Edit Donation option.  
 
 h. Remedy Ticket 55649, National Service Codes Entry Fixed.
 
 i. Remedy Ticket 56678, Occasional Hours By Organization Report.  The date
 will be expanded on the Occasional Hours By Organization report so the year
 will not be cut off.
 
 j. Remedy Ticket 57222, Address Labels, Organization Added.
 
 k. Remedy Ticket 57743, Invalid Volunteer Data.  Do not allow numeric
 characters in the name field.
 
 l. Remedy Ticket 58399, Group Name Not Appearing on Donation Memo/Receipt.
 
 m. Remedy Ticket 58557, Enhancement, Pull Voluntary Mail Stop.
 
 n. Remedy Ticket 60885, Error in Donor Last Name When Searching.
 
 o. Remedy Ticket 61684, Error Posting Volunteer Record.  Prevents entering a
 SSN with a single hyphen.
 
 p. Remedy Ticket 65273, Assigning Organizational Codes.
 
 q. Remedy Ticket 66862 and 65351, Adding Users.
 
 r. Remedy Ticket 67206, VS01 Part 2.  This remedy ticket deals with matching
 the numbers on the VS01 Part 2 and VS30 Alpha Reports.  The numbers are
 different due to volunteer entry and termination dates; and the adjusted
 hours.  The counts and the hours on the VS01 Part 2 report are correct and no
 changes were made to this report for 3.09.  The VS30 report has been changed
 in version 3.09 to only list volunteers who have logged Regular Scheduled (RS)
 Hours in the selected fiscal year.  Adjusted hours are no longer added to the
 RS Hours.  The bottom of the report totals the RS Hours and then adds all
 accumulated adjustment hours entered up to the last day of the fiscal year. 
 By breaking out the adjustment hours, both reports should match.  There will
 be cases when they will not match.  One case is when a volunteer logged RS
 Hours in a fiscal year but does not have an entry date until the next fiscal
 year (example: hours logged in FY 2002, entry date in FY 2003).  It is
 important that the entry date not be after the date the first RS Hours are
 entered.  The same applies to the termination date.  The termination date
 should not be before the last date the RS Hours entered.  Version 3.09 adds
 checks to both the entry and termination date to prevent the user from
 entering a date that would cause the report counts and hours to be off.
