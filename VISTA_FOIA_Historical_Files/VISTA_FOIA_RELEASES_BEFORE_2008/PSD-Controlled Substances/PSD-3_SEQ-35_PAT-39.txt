Subject: RETURN TO STOCK ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  When the user uses the Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK]
  option to return a controlled substance to stock, the Controlled 
  Substances 3.0 package is accessed to update the drug balance. During
  this process, the problems detailed below can occur.
  
  1. After updating the balances in Controlled Substances 3.0, the 
  Outpatient Pharmacy 7.0 software requires the user to enter comments
  concerning the transaction. If the user exits the program at this point,
  the item is not marked as returned to stock in the Prescription file
  (#52), therefore it can be selected again, and the balances updated in
  Controlled Substances 3.0 again.
  
  The solution for this is for an additional check on the transaction before
  allowing updating of balances in Controlled Substances 3.0.
  
  2. The second issue related to this process is that when the Controlled
  Substances 3.0 software is updating the balances, the name of the 
  dispensing site is retained. If the user then exits the Outpatient 
  Pharmacy 7.0 software, and accesses the Controlled Substances 3.0
  software, the user is not prompted for the name of the dispensing site.
  
  The solution for this is to not retain the name of the dispensing
  site.
  
  3. The third issue of this patch is on fills returned to stock, then
  re-issued. Controlled Substances 3.0 will not allow the release of 
  the new fill.
  
  The solution for this is to add additional checks on the prescription
  to ensure it is not the fill that was previously returned to stock.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 5 minutes.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should

  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSD*3.0*39).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSD*3.0*39.

     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
