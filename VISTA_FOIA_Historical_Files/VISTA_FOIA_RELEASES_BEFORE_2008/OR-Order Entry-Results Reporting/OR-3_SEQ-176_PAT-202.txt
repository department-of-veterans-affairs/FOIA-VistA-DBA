Subject: Code Set Versioning (CSV) and CPRS GUI v22

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Code Set Versioning (CSV) project was established to modify the 
 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VISTA) to 
 comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act 
 (HIPAA).  This Act stipulates that diagnostic and procedure codes used for
 billing purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the time the
 service was provided. 
  
 Twenty-two applications have been modified to comply with the HIPAA 
 requirements.  These changes support collection of encounter and billing 
 data that is date sensitive.  Only items associated with codes that are 
 active on the specified date are selectable.
  
 CPRS GUI v22 includes the CSV changes.  These changes will be apparent to 
 the user when the following server-side patches are installed.
  
 - Automated Information Collection Service (AICS)    IBD*3*51
 - Clinical Lexicon                                   LEX*2*25
 - Clinical Reminders                                 PXRM*1.5*18
 - Consults/Request Tracking                          GRMC*3*33
 - Order Entry/Results Reporting                      OR*3*181
 - CPT Codes (Includes HCPCS)                         ICPT*6*14
 - ICD Codes                                          ICD*18*6
 - Problem List                                       GMPL*2*28
 - Text Integration Utility (TIU)                     TIU*1*161
  
 CSV Software Implementation Schedule
 ==================================== 
 To comply with HIPAA legislation, all CSV patches must be installed by
 September 30, 2003.
  
 CSV Functionality Changes

 For a detailed description of the CSV functionality included in CPRS GUI 
 please refer to the following updated documents:

 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [ananymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
 Listed below is a summary of CSV changes that are included in CPRS GUI 
 v22.
  
 HIPAA CODE SET VERSIONING--CPRS GUI v22
 ======================================= 
 - Code Set Versioning (CSV) project will modify VistA to comply with the 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA).  HIPAA 
 stipulates that diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes 
 must be the codes that were applicable at the time the service was 
 provided.   The evaluation of ICD and CPT codes for validity as of a 
 specified date, is fully implemented in CPRS GUI v22.  These changes will 
 be apparent in the following scenarios:
  
 -- Cover sheet:  
 - The list of active problems will display a "#" symbol next to the 
 problem if that problem is associated with an ICD code that is inactive 
 as of the current date.  Clicking on this problem will display a dialog 
 warning the user about the inactive code, and encouraging correction via 
 the Problems tab.
  
 -- Problems tab:  
 - The same "#" symbol will be displayed in the "Status" column next to 
 problems associated with a currently inactive code.  On first displaying 
 the list, a message will be displayed to the user if any such problems 
 have been found.
 - Entry of a new problem will only allow selection of ICD codes that are 
 active as of the current date.  This applies both to the lexicon lookup 
 and to the predefined list of selectable problems and categories.
 - Any action taken on an active problem having an inactive ICD code will 
 first require correction/update of that code via the "Change" action.
  
 -- Consults/Procedures:
 - The lexicon lookup for provisional diagnosis will only allow selection 
 of items with an active ICD code as of the ordering date.
 - Copying or changing of existing orders containing a currently inactive 
 ICD code for provisional diagnosis will prevent acceptance of the order 
 until a new code is selected.  The same applies to predefined quick 
 orders containing an inactive ICD code as of the ordering date.
 - Edit/Resubmit of a consult or procedure request will evaluate the ICD 
 code associated with the original request, and will require it to be 
 changed if currently inactive before the request can be resubmitted.
  
 -- Encounter Form
 - Only ICD and CPT codes (and modifiers) active as of the encounter date 
 will be selectable from the encounter form.  This applies to the Visit 
 Type, Diagnoses, and Procedures tabs.
 - On the Diagnoses tab, items from the problem list associated with an 
 ICD code that is inactive as of the encounter date will be flagged with a 
 "#" symbol next to the code. These problems will not be selectable as 
 diagnoses until corrected via the Problems tab.
  
 --Clinical Reminders
 -Reminder taxonomy definitions track the adjacent lower and higher code 
 values for each range of codes, and tracks changes to these values when a 
 new code set is installed.
 -Reminder taxonomy editing of a range of codes uses new CSV API utilities 
 to select active or inactive codes.
 -Reminder taxonomy inquiry displays now include activation periods, 
 adjacent lower and higher code values and selectable status for the GUI.
 -Dialog parameter setup for using taxonomies allows selectable diagnosis 
 and selectable procedures to be selected that are active and inactive.  
 The CPRS GUI will only allow selection of codes that are active on the 
 encounter date.
 -Reminder dialog editing of finding item and additional finding items 
 allows access to codes that are active and inactive.  The CPRS GUI will 
 only use codes that are active on the encounter date.
