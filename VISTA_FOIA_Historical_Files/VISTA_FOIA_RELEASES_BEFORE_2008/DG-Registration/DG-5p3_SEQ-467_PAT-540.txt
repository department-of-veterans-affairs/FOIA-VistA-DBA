Subject: Fix Converted IVM Case Display Issue

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct a couple of problems with displaying a converted
 IVM Means Test as a result of a Z06 transmission from the HEC.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following E3R(s):
 ------------------------------------------
 There are no E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 IVM-0703-30833 - VISTA MT SCREENS 2-4
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 IVM-0703-30833 - VISTA MT SCREENS 2-4
  
 Problem:
 --------
 1. Viewing a Past Means Test shows no income amounts on the first 
    screen, but does on subsequent screens 2-4.  The Individual 
    Annual Income, Deductible Expenses, and Net Worth amounts of the 
    veteran from the previous calendar year are displaying on screens 2-4
    as if they belong to the current IVM Converted Test.
  
 2. The message that displays at the bottom of Screen 4, (PREVIOUS 
    CALENDAR YEAR NET WORTH, SCREEN <4>), normally shows the Total 
    Income just entered, while edting a test, and the new status 
    calculated for the Means Test.  In View mode, this amount and status do
    not change, but this message is currently showing $0 Income and
    Indicating a Means Test Status of MT COPAY EXEMPT for the converted 
    IVM Means Tests. It should be Null Income (not reported) and the Status
    should be MT COPAY REQUIRED.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. The Income,Deductible Expenses, and Net Worth amounts for the prior
    year will not be displayed for IVM Converted Cases on screens 2-4.
  
 2. The message at the bottom of screen 4 will not be displayed when
    Viewing a Past Means Test, since the proper Income and status already 
    appear upon first viewing the Patient's Means test.
