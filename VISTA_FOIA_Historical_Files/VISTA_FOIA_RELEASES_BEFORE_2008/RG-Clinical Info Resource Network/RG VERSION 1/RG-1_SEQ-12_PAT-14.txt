Subject: MPI/PD-CPRS REMOTE DATA VIEWS CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  MPIF*1.0*8, RG*1.0*4 and RG*1.0*8 are required builds for patch RG*1*14.
   
  Patches RG*1*14 and RG*1*15 should be installed together.  RG*1*14
  brings in the routine and data dictionary changes needed by RG*1*15.
   
  1.  The goal of the CPRS REMOTE DATA VIEWS project is to utilize
  Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and Master
  Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) to retrieve a list of facilities at which
  a patient has been seen.  Using the CPRS Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  Reports Tab, the user may select the report they would like to see and
  the site from which they would like to retrieve the report.
   
  In VistA, ancillary packages pass clinic workload data to the Patient
  Care Encounter (PCE) software.  This clinic workload data eventually
  gets filed in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file with a status of
  CHECKED OUT.  These clinics are defined as "count" clinics.
  Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Laboratory and Surgery software passes
  clinic workload information to PCE.  It is for these applications,
  Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Laboratory and Surgery that data is not
  being tracked.  Subsequently, the CPRS REMOTE PATIENT DATA VIEWS
  software cannot examine these patient events.
   
  This patch exports the routines necessary to build and deliver Health
  Level Seven (HL7) messages that track patient admissions and discharges
  on the Registration side, and clinic checkouts on the Scheduling side
  including those clinic checkouts reflecting "count" clinic workload.
  This patch, in conjunction with RG*1.0*15, resolves issues reported in
  NOIS WRJ-1200-10722 and MAC-0101-61732.
   
  2.  A problem was identified in NOIS message DAY-0101-41496 wherein a
  link attempts to acknowledge an HL7 acknowledgment message for the RG
  ADT-A01 CLIENT and RG ADT-A03 CLIENT protocols.  HL7 incorrectly called
  the PROCESSING ROUTINE (#771) field in the PROTOCOL (#101) file rather
  than the RESPONSE PROCESSING ROUTINE (#772) field.  A code change was
  made in RGADT to quit if an acknowledgment message is passed in for
  processing.  This eliminates the "LLP Exceeded Retry Param" issue.
   
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  The MPI/PD DATA COMPARE COMP DATE (#13) field in the CIRN SITE
  PARAMETER (#991.8) file is used to ensure that the data comparison 
  processing routine is run only once at a facility.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 2 minutes.
   
  1.  Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE],
      unschedule the following option:
        VAFC BATCH UPDATE          UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3
    
  2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  3.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*14).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*14.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  At the prompt, 'Enter protocols
      you wish to Mark as out of Order:' enter RG ADT ENCOUNTER DRIVER.
   
  9.  Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE],
      schedule the option VAFC BATCH UPDATE [UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3]
      to run every 10 minutes.
