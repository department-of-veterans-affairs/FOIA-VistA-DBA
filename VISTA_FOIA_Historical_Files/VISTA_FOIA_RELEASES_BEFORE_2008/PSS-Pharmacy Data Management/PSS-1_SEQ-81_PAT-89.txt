Description:
============

 This project consists of 12 patches that work together to create a new
 Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
 rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
 finding types are included in the index.
  
 The 13 patches that comprise this project are:
  
  PXRM*1.5*12
  DG*5.3*478
  GMPL*2*27
  GMRV*4*15
  LR*5.2*295
  OR*3*157
  PSS*1*62
  PSS*1*89
  PSJ*5*90
  PSO*7*118
  PX*1*119
  RA*5*33
  YS*5.01*77
  
 The purpose of this patch (PSS*1*89) is to lay the groundwork for these
 changes by creating new cross-references in the PHARMACY PATIENT file 
 (#55) that will be responsible for updating the new Clinical Reminders 
 index global. These are the new cross-references added to the NON-VA
 MEDS multiple (#55.05) and the fields used as the trigger-points. The 
 type of these cross-references is 'New', not 'Traditional'.
