Subject: ADDITIONAL ENCOUNTER PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE:  Patches SD*5.3*292 and TIU*1.0*168 are being released in a
        single distribution and will be installed together.
  
 Deputy under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA) has requested enhancement to VistA to 
 automate the gathering and reporting of data for additional performance 
 indicators. The Office of Quality and Performance (OQP) is interested in 
 gathering data for two performance indicators involving Scheduling and 
 Radiology. This patch addresses the first indicator; it measures the 
 percentages of outpatient encounters in ambulatory care with completed or 
 amended electronic progress notes signed by the primary care provider for 
 that encounter. The report identifies the encounter, finds any progress 
 note (PN) associated with the encounter, looks at the PN and reports the 
 date the PN was signed by the provider. It then looks at the results and 
 reports the encounter as compliant or non compliant based on nationally 
 or locally defined criteria depending on the option used to generate the 
 report. For additional information, please see the new menu option 
 descriptions that follow.
  
 This patch provides three new options to Scheduling.  These three options 
 are distinct from each other, and do not rely in any way upon the other.
  
 NEW MENU OPTIONS
 =================
  
 Performance Monitor Menu [SCRPW PERFORMANCE MONITOR MENU]
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 This option provides a path to accessing the new Performance Monitor
 Options included in this patch, it's located under the ACRP Reports
 Menu [SCRPW ACRP REPORTS MENU]
  
 Performance Monitor Summary Report [SCRPW PM SUMMARY]
 -----------------------------------------------------
 This option will provide users with a tool for monitoring outpatient 
 encounters, their associated progress notes, and the number of days it
 took providers to sign the progress note. This information is similar to
 the data that will be collected for the national performance measure that
 is to be rolled up to AAC. With this option users will have the ability to
 run this report at any time for a selected date range. It will use 
 nationally defined stop codes to screen encounters. This option is 
 located on the new Performance Monitor Menu [SCRPW PERFORMANCE MONITOR
 MENU] that has been placed in the ACRP Reports Menu [SCRPW ACRP REPORTS
 MENU]. The summary report reflects encounter counts for the facility first
 and then breaks down the counts for each division.
  
 The information provided:
    
 Facility Name
 Run date     
 Date Range Selected
 Total number of encounters
 Total number of encounters and the percentages for day categories:
   
         0-1  >1-2  >2-3  >3-4  >4-5  >5-6  
        >6-7  >7-8  >8-9  >9-10 >10
  
 Total number of encounters with progress notes pending signatures
 Total number of encounters pending progress notes
 The percentages for each pending status
 Total number of encounters with scanned notes
  
  
 Performance Monitor Detailed Report [SCRPW PM DETAILED REPORT]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 This option will provide users with a detailed report. The report will 
 include information for outpatient encounters that pass the user input 
 screening criteria. This option is located on the new Performance 
 Monitor Menu [SCRPW PERFORMANCE MONITOR MENU] that has been placed in
 the ACRP Reports Menu [SCRPW ACRP REPORTS MENU]
  
 When running the report, users will have the option of defining the 
 screening criteria to be used.
  
         TLMT - Number of days to use for flagging note as
                Compliant/Non-Complaint
         Start Date - Report starting date
         End Date - Report ending date
         Division - one/many/all
         Provider - one/many/all
         Stop Code - one/many/all
         Count Scanned Notes - Yes/No
  
 The user will need to define sort criteria one and two from the following
 choices:
  
        DIVISION
        CLINIC
        PROVIDER
        STOP CODE
        DATE
        PATIENT
  
 The information presented will be:
  
 1. Facility Summary Sheet
  
 2. Sort Criteria 1 Detailed Information
  
      Encounter Date
      Patient Name
      Last four of SSN and pseudo indicator
      Primary Provider 
      DSS ID (Stop Code)
      Clinic Name 
      Acceptable Provider (Provider who signed or co-signed)
      Date Signed (Date the note was signed)
      Elapsed Time (Number of days gone by before signing note)
  
 3. Sort Criteria 1 Subtotals
  
 The subtotals will be based on the 1st sorting selection made by the 
 user. If the user selected division for sort criteria one, the subtotals
 will reflect subtotals for each division. If the user selected clinic for
 the sort criteria one, then the subtotals will reflect the subtotals for
 the individual clinics. 
  
 ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE MONITORS API
 ===================================
  
 Patch TIU*1*168 determines whether a progress note class note has been
 properly and timely signed based on a visit.
   
 PIMS calls this API ($$PM^TIUPXPM) in order to determine if a progress
 note has been signed/co-signed/amended, properly signed/co-signed
 or amended, and date signed.  This is done on a visit by
 visit basis.
  
 PIMS passes the visit IEN (VIEN) to $$PM^TIUPXPM. TIUPXPM then 
 determines which note types belongs to the Progress Note Class. The
 providers involved in the visit are checked to determine if Primary or
 Secondary and their Person Class at the time of the visit. TIUPXPM then
 processes all the notes associated with the visit, looking at note
 status, who signed it, and whether a scanned image is involved. It then 
 places the note in one of five categories described in patch description
 TIU*1.0*168.
  
 Use of this API by PIMS is supported under DBIA # 4163
