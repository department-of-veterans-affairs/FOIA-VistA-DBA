Description: 
============

 INTRODUCTION 
 ============
  
 The main purpose of the AICS GAF project is to allow Global Assessment 
 of Function (GAF) scores to be collected for outpatient encounters via 
 AICS encounter form scanning or AICS Manual Data Entry.  The GAF score 
 information will be filed in the VistA Mental Health software package 
 files.  This functionality is in compliance with VHA Directive, 97-059, 
 dated November 25, 1997, "Instituting Global Assessment of Function 
 (GAF) Scores in Axis V Mental Health Patients".  It provides guidelines 
 for collection of GAF Scores for outpatients and inpatients.  Inpatient 
 Axis V (GAF) scores have been collected for several years, but up to 
 now there has been no provision for collection of GAF Scores for 
 outpatient encounters using the VistA AICS software package.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 This patch will add 3 additional blocks that will be available during
 Forms Design. 
  
 GAF DISPLAY V3.0               Previous GAF Score Display Only
 GAF HAND PRINT V3.0            Previous GAF Score and Hand Print     
 GAF SCORE MULT CHOICE V3.0     Previous and New GAF Score    
  
 CHANGED OPTIONS
 ===============
 This patch does incorporate questions needed to file a GAF Score in the
 Mental Health Package.  See below for an example of AICS Manual Data
 Entry.
  
         Select GAF Provider:  
         Enter GAF Score :  (1-100):         
  
 CHANGED OR ADDITIONAL BLOCKS
 ============================
  
 GAF DISPLAY V3.0 block displays the previous GAF Score, Provider,
 Date/Time of GAF Score and if a GAF Score is required.  No input 
 is required.
  
 GAF HAND PRINT V3.0 block displays the previous GAF Score, 
 Provider, Date/Time of GAF Score and if a GAF Score is required.
 GAF Score can be written in by provider and Provider can be
 selected by marking a bubble.
  
 GAF SCORE MULT CHOICE V3.0 block displays the previous GAF 
 Score, Provider, Date/Time of GAF Score and if a GAF Score is
 required.  GAF Score can be selected by marking multiple bubbles.
 GAF Provider can be selected by marking a bubble.
