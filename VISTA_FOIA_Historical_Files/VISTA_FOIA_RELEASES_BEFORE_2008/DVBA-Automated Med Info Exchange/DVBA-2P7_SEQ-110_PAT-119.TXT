Subject: CORRECT PRINT/REPRINT OF C&P EXAMS - HD123081/HD182834

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues.  The first issue is a problem with
 VISTA headers that print incorrectly on CAPRI reports causing formatting
 issues.  The second issue is to remove the VISTA TIU $END keyword used to
 denote the end of a report when doing the Re-Print Final C&P Report.
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1.  HD123081    C&P Exam report, suppress VistA page header  
 2.  HD182834    Supress $END text from printing in Re-Print Final Reports

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  
 1.  HD123081    C&P Exam report, suppress VistA page header  
  
 Problem:
 -----------
 When printing a C&P examination report from within an individual patient 
 record, the print includes the VistA header page information.  CAPRI has 
 its own headers and footers.  This problem affects ALL sites and ALL C&P 
 exam reports.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Suppress the VistA headers from the C&P Exam report so that it will 
 enhance readability and save paper.  
  
 2.  HD182834    Supress $END text from printing in Re-Print Final Reports
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During the Re-Print Final C&P Report the text $END sometimes is displayed 
 to the user.  This comes from the VISTA TIU note templates and used to 
 signify an end of the section/note/etc.  This is not displayed in VISTA 
 so it should not be displayed in CAPRI.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Made a change to the routine handling the Re-Print Final C&P Report 
 Remote Procedure Call to find $END and replace it with null.  Now when 
 the report is displayed in CAPRI $END is not displayed.  The value is 
 still stored within the global, but now is handled correctly in CAPRI.
