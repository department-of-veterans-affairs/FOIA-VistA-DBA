Subject: CORRECT PROBLEM WITH CIDC ASSIGN PARAMETER & DISABLE FOR ALL PROVIDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the problem with the "Assign parameter and Disable for
 all providers" not disabling the providers with the parameter already 
 assigned.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(S):
 ============================
 HD146415 - CIDC "Assign parameter and Disable for all providers" parameter
            does not disable users.
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Saginaw VAMC
 Puget Sound HCS
 Loma Linda VAMC
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 Problem: HD146415
 --------
 The original design of the "Assign parameter and Disable for all 
 providers" option does not disable users with the CIDC parameter already
 assigned. The same is true for the "Assign parameter and Enable for all
 providers". If the CIDC parameter has already been assigned it does not
 enable users. Both options will only give the parameter to those providers
 who do not already have it and enable/disable CIDC functionality based
 upon user selection.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify ORWDBA10 to both assign the CIDC parameter and enable/disable to 
 those providers without it and change the current setting of those
 providers with the CIDC parameter assigned. Modify ORWDBA6 to display the
 proper help information to reflect the changes made in ORWDBA10.
