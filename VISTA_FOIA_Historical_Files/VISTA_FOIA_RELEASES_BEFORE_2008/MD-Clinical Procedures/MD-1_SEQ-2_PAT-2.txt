 ************************************************************************
 ATTENTION
 Clinical Procedures v.1.0 is a Controlled Release.  Therefore, the 
 compliance dates that are exported with released patches will ONLY apply to
 all sites that have installed and implemented Clinical Procedures in their 
 Production Account.  For the sites that have not installed or implemented 
 Clinical Procedures, the compliance dates for all released patches will be 
 30 days AFTER each site has installed and implemented Clinical Procedures 
 into its Production Account and has signed off with the Technical Support 
 Office that the package is running successfully with at least one medical 
 device in their Production Account.

    Component file (#142.1) will be modified to call entry points in routine 
    MDPS1 to extract the Medicine and Clinical Procedures text reports for
    display in the Health Summary report of CPRS Reports tab:

 3) MDPOSTI also will rename the entry ORRPW MEDICINE to ORRPW MEDICINE/CP
    in the Order Entry/Result Reporting (OE/RR) Report file (#101.24).
    The "Medicine" report component within the CPRS Reports tab under the
    Clinical Reports tree-view will now read "Medicine/CP".(Refer to IA #4327)

 The CPRS Report components, "Medicine abnormal brief","Medicine brief 
 report","Medicine full report","Medicine full captioned","Procedures (local
 only)" and "Procedures" will use routines MDPS1 and MDPS3 to extract
 Medicine and Clinical Procedures Reports for display.  The TIU interpretation
 document text will be displayed as the CP text report.  The Medicine View
 file (#690.2) will be used to determine which fields will be displayed in
 the Medicine report.  Make sure the fields that need to be displayed for the
 Medicine report are added and also the procedure is entered for the type of
 report in file (#690.2) to be displayed.
 
 Routine MDPS2 will be used for the Medicine/CP report generator.
