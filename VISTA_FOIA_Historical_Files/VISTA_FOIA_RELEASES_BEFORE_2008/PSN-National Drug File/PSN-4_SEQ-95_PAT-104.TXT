Description:
============

 This patch makes a change to one of the National Drug File encapsulation
 routines. DBIA 4545 has been modified to reflect changes to the DATA 
 component, which returns data from the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68). Added to
 the output will be the VA GENERIC NAME field (#.05) of the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68), along with the NAME field (#.01) of that VA GENERIC file (#50.6)
 entry.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
 from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation includes:
  
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PHAR_1_API_R0805.PDF             Updated Pharmacy Re-Engineering API 
                                    Manual
  
 Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VistA Documentation
 Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
 http://www.va.gov/vdl
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  This patch exports a routine that is a supported reference, so any other 
  Vista application can make a call to this routine. For that reason, it is
  recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a 
  minimum.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*104)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*104.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
  
 8. When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
