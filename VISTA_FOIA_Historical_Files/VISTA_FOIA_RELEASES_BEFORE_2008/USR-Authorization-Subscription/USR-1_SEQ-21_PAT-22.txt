Subject: ASU - USER CLASS UPDATE CORRECTION.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
  
 This patch provides the following change to the Authorized Subscription 
 Utility:
  
         A problem was detected using the CHANGE USER action while in the
         LIST MEMBERSHIP by USER option.  When changing to a new user,
         the system was retaining the prior user's DUZ which inadvertently
         updated the prior user's CLASSES - not the current user's - when
         making changes. (NOIS:  HIN-0900-40364)
  
         Installing a new version of USRULST corrects this problem.
