 Patch OR*3.0*258, CPRS GUI version 26.68, resolves two patient safety 
 issues listed below.
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES:
 =====================
  
 PSI-06-053/PSI-06-063: Lack of default medication route led to multiple 
 medication errors (Remedy 142622, 144208)
  
 PROBLEM: CPRS GUI v26 (OR*3.0*215) introduced a software change
 inadvertently resulting in the default route of administration for a
 medication no longer displaying if one was defined. This has resulted in
 instances of the incorrect route of administration being selected at
 several sites.
  
 RESOLUTION: Upon installation of OR*3.0*258, the default route of 
 administration for a medication will display if one is defined. This
 resolves PSI-06-063.  As a reminder of functionality present before 
 OR*3.0*258, if there is only one medication route it will automatically be
 defaulted.
  
 PSI-06-062: Medication renewal dialog focused on CANCEL rather than OK 
 (Remedy 144128)
  
 PROBLEM: CPRS GUI v26 (OR*3.0*215) inadvertently changed the default 
 action for completing the renewing of medication and text orders. In CPRS
 GUI v25, "OK" is the default button.  In CPRS GUI v26, "OK" is the default
 button however the "CANCEL" button has the default focus.  Pressing the
 "Enter" or "Space" keys activates the default focus.  Providers, who are
 accustomed to pressing the "Enter" key to close the dialog, may not notice
 that the order is canceled instead of being renewed.
  
 RESOLUTION: Upon installation of OR*3.0*258, the initial state of the 
 Renewal Ordering dialog once again allows the user to press "Enter" to 
 activate the "OK" button.  This resolves PSI-06-062.

 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES:
 ================================
  
 -- Required Patches:
  
 Before you can install OR_30_258.KID, you must install OR*3.0*215 and 
 PSS*1.0*113.
  
 NOTE: If installing OR*3.0*258 immediately following OR*3.0*215, it is 
 NOT necessary to move BOTH the OR*3.0*215 and OR*3.0*258 CPRSChart.EXE 
 files to the appropriate directory where they can be accessed by all CPRS 
 workstations; ONLY moving the OR*3.0*258 CPRSChart.EXE file is sufficient.
  
 -- Installation Compliance Date:
  
 OR*3.0*258 must be installed by the compliance date of July 21, 2006. 
 This coincides with the compliance date for the following other patches: 
 OR*3.0*215
 OR*3.0*251
 PSO*7.0*214
 PSS*1.0*93
 SD*5.3*285
 TIU*1.0*184 / DG*5.3*554 / USR*1.0*27
 TIU*1.0*202
  
 -- Internet Explorer:
  
 NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE4) or later is REQUIRED in order for 
 GUI version 26.68 to run.  However IE 5.5 or later with 128-bit 
 encryption is required for PKI functionality.
  
 -- Build components:
                                                                         
 The KIDS portion of the installation will simply update the version number
 of the OR CPRS GUI CHART option to be 1.0.26.68 with routine ORY258. The 
 .ZIP file contains an updated CPRS executable.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

     appropriate actions.
  
 2.  Obtain the file OR_30_258.KID.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
 4.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_258.KID when prompted to Enter
