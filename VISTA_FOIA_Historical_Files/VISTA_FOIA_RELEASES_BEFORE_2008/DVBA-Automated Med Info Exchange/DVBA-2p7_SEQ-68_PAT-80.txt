 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1)  VAC-1004-20720   Updates to AMIE C&P Disability Exam Checklist for RO
  
     Problem:
     --------
     VBA has added 2 new C&P exams to the current AMIE C&P exam checklist.
     VACO has requested that these 2 new exams be added to the
     AMIE C&P Disability Exam Checklist for RO.  Additionally, Dr.
     Tomlinson (VACO) has requested that the name for the AMIE Social Work
     Social and Industrial Survey (S&I) worksheet be changed to read Social
     and Industrial Survey.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine DVBCEXM1, which contains the text for the AMIE C&P Disability
     Exam Checklist, will be changed as requested to include the 2 new
     exams.  Routine DVBCSIS will be changed to reflect "Social and
     Industrial Survey" as the new name for the AMIE Exam worksheet.

     the AMIE Exam worksheet in the AMIE Exam file (396.6).
