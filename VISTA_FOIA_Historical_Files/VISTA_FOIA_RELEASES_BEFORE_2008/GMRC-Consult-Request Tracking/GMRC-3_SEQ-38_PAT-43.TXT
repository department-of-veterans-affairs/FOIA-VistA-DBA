   Calculation(compl time statistics)--SAME DAY
  
 1. PUG-0604-50750     Calculation(compl time statistics)--SAME DAY
  
    Problem:
    -----------
    The Completion Time Statistics [GMRC COMPLETION STATISTICS] option uses
    %DTC to calculate the difference between the request date and the
    completion date. The problem is the utility %DTC only deals in whole
    days, so when a consult request date is on the same day as the completion
    date, the Mean Days To Complete is calculated with a zero value for that
    consultation. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    The Completion Time Statistics [GMRC COMPLETION STATISTICS] option was
    modified to use a Kernel utility XLFDT to consider the time of day in
    the request and completion, to calculate the percentage of a day when
    the consult request date and the completion date are the same.
