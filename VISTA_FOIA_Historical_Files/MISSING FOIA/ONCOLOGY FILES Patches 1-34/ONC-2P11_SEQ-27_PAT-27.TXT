 This patch also resolves the following E3R request:
   
     E3R #15401, AUTOPSY SUSPENSE
   
 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
   
  1) REQUIRED FIELD EDIT CHECK
   
     The edit check, which prohibits the user from changing the ABSTRACT
     STATUS (165.5,91) to "Complete" unless all "required fields" have
     been entered, has been enhanced to include more fields.
   
  2) INTERFIELD EDIT CHECKS
   
     Interfield edit checks have been added. If there are interfield
     problems, warning messages will appear when the user attempts to change
     the ABSTRACT STATUS (165.5,91) to "Complete".  These warnings may
     be overridden by the user.
    
  3) TEXT LENGTH EDIT CHECKS
   
     The following ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5) text fields will now be checked
     for text length each time they are accessed.  If the text length exceeds
     the maximum NAACCR extract length, a warning will inform the user of
     the current text length and the maximum length allowable.  The user
     will then be given an opportunity to re-edit the text.
   
     The warning may be ignored with the understanding that only the maximum
     NAACCR length will be extracted and downloaded.  Characters in excess 
     of the NAACCR limit will be truncated.

     These fields may be edited via the new "Over-ride Flags" option
     of the Primary Sub-menu.
   
  5) NOIS UNY-0900-11443 (Error, TSSTRP^ONCIPC5 Undefined Variable)
     NOIS ALB-0900-50747 (UNDEFINED VARIABLE SUBSUR AFTER PATCH 26)
   
     Primary Intracranial/CNS Tumors PCE study
     Item 78. TYPE OF SUBSEQUENT SURGICAL TX FOR RECURRENCE/PROGRESSION    
     
     If the primary selected did not have any SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT
     (165.5,60) data, the application would abort with an "undefined 
     variable SUBSUR" error at item 78 (TYPE OF SUBSEQUENT SURGICAL TX FOR 
     RECURRENCE/PROGRESSION) of the Primary Intracranial/CNS Tumors PCE study.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  6) NOIS BHS-0900-11454 (Y2K - DATE OF BIRTH DISPLAY)
     NOIS DAY-1100-41540 (Patient DOB showing up as 1701)
   
     [IR Patient Summary]
     [EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c)]
     [PI Patient Information]
     [API Annual ACOS Patient Index (132c)]
     [ASL Annual Primary Site/GP Listing (132c)]
   
     The DOB (160.3) value was not displaying correctly on the above 
     reports.
      
     This has been fixed.
   
  7) NOIS NJH-0900-21785 (Unable to abstract after ONC*2.11*26)
     Duplicate STATION NUMBERs
   
     EXAMPLE OF PROBLEM:
   
     ************************ CREATE PRIMARY RECORD **********************
   
                            for TEST,PATIENT

     SEQUENCE NUMBER: 00// 00?? 
   
                         <ENTRY DELETED> - press RETURN to continue->
   
     This problem was due to duplicate/ambiguous STATION NUMBER values.
     This has been fixed.
   
  8) NOIS HOU-1000-72547 (Fileman assumes line scope in  input tra)
     NOIS HOU-1000-72584 (COMPUTED FIELD DISPLAYING DATA/NO FILL O)
   
     [ANN *..Annual Reports ...]
      [CPR Print Custom Reports]
       [2 PATIENT]
   
     The user was attempting to print a custom report sorting by the 
     computed field SITE/GP-DTDX (160,35).  This would cause an "undefined
     variable DISX(2)" error.  This field was designed to produce a list of a 
     patient's SITE/GP (165.5,.01) and DATE DX (165.5,3) values.  It was not
     intended to be used as a sort value.
   
     We have been given permission to delete this field.  It has been 
     flagged for deletion and functionally disabled.  It will be officially 
     deleted at a future date.
   
  9) [CT Create ACOS Data Disk]
     [CC Create State Data Disk]
     Treatment - Subsq & Other
   
     If the "Subsq RX nn Course Surg" value was "None", the application was
     extracting a code of "0".  The correct code is "00".
   
     This has been fixed.
   
 10) METASTASIS STUFFING
   
     When it was appropriate to stuff METASTASIS 1 (165.5,34) with 9
     (Other/Gen/Carcinomatosis/Unkn), METASTASIS 2 (165.5,34.1) and 
     METASTASIS 3 (165.5,34.2) were being stuffed with 0 (None).  This
     was incorrect.  METASTASIS 2 and METASTASIS 3 should also be stuffed
     with 9.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
 11) [SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...]
      [DI Disease Index]
   
     The [DI Disease Index] option did not contain multidivisional screens.
     All records which satisfied the search criteria were displayed 
     regardless of their division.  This option will now display only records
     whose division matches the user's division or a division affiliated with
     the user's division.
   
 12) STATE AT DX (165.5,16)
   
     The following STATE AT DX code descriptions were incorrect.  They have 
     been fixed.
   
     Old code description: XX = Foreign Country other than Canada
     New code description: XX = US, NOS/Canada, NOS/Oth Cntry Known    
   
     Old code description: YY = Unknown
     New code description: YY = Country Unknown, Not US, Not Canada     
   
     The following STATE AT DX code has been added.
   
                           ZZ = Unknown
   
 13) RECONSTRUCTION/RESTORATION (165.5,23)
   
     For LUNG cases RECONSTRUCTION/RESTORATION had a default value of 9
     (Unknown; not stated; death certificate ONLY).  This default was
     incorrect and has been removed.
   
 14) DATE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION (165.5,1)
     DATE OF INPATIENT DISCHARGE (165.5,1.1)
   
     The users may now enter 00000000 and 99999999 as values for the above
     fields.
   
 15) SIZE OF TUMOR (165.5,29)
   
     The SIZE OF TUMOR input and output logic has been modified to 
     accommodate the difference between Melanoma and non-Melanoma cases.
   
     For non-Melanoma cases, SIZE OF TUMOR must be a 3-digit whole number in
     the range 000-998.  This values represents the size of the primary 
     tumor in millimeters.  Decimals values are not allowed.
   
     For Melanoma cases, thickness, NOT size, is coded.  SIZE OF TUMOR must
     be a value in the range 0.01-9.98.  2 decimals place are allowed but
     not required.  The value may not exceed 9.98 mm.
   
     For both Melanoma and non-Melanoma cases:
   
     000 = No mass; no tumor found
     999 = Not stated; NA  
   
 16) RACE 1 (160,8)
     RACE 2 (160,8.1)
     RACE 3 (160,8.2)
     RACE 4 (160,8.3)
     RACE 5 (160,8.4)
   
    To accommodate patients of more than one race the following changes have
    been made:
   
    a) RACE has been renamed RACE 1.
     
    b) RACE 2, RACE 3, RACE 4 and RACE 5 have been added to the patient data
       input dialog.
   
    c) Code 88 (NA) has been added to the RACE CODE FOR ONCOLOGY (#164.46)
       file.
   
 17) NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY/DIAGNOSTIC, STAGING, OR PALLIATIVE 
     PROCEDURES
   
     The ROADS terminology NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY has been changed
     to DIAGNOSTIC, STAGING, OR PALLIATIVE PROCEDURES.
   
     The following ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) field names have been changed to
     reflect this change:
   
          OLD NAME                            NEW NAME
          --------                            --------
     58.1 NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY         DX/STAGING/PALLIATIVE PROC
     58.3 NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURG DATE       DX/STGING/PALLIATIVE PROC DATE
     58.4 NON CA-DIR SURG @FACILITY           DX/STAGING/PALL PROC @FACILITY
     58.5 NON CA-DIR SURG @FACILITY DATE      DX/STAGING/PALL @FACILITY DATE
   
 18) 2000 INTRACRANIAL/CNS TUMORS PCE STUDY
     ITEM 33. TUMOR SIZE
 
     Intracranial/CNS Tumors PCE item 33, TUMOR SIZE, is NOT the same as 
     ROADS data item SIZE OF TUMOR (165.5,29).  We were using SIZE OF TUMOR
     for item 33 which is incorrect.
 
     A new field, TUMOR SIZE (165.5,1394) has been added for item 33.  The
     existing Intracranial/CNS Tumors PCE Studies will need to be re-edited
     to populate this new field.
 
 19) C39.0 RESPIRATORY TRACT, UPPER
     C39.8 RESPIRATORY TRACT OVERLAP
     C39.9 RESPIRATORY TRACT, ILL-DEFINED
 
     The following topographies had incorrect SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY
     (#164.2) associations:
 
     Topography                            Incorrect SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY
     ----------                            ---------------------------------
     C39.0 RESPIRATORY TRACT, UPPER        NASAL CAVITY/SINUS/EAR
     C39.8 RESPIRATORY TRACT OVERLAP       NASAL CAVITY/SINUS/EAR
     C39.9 RESPIRATORY TRACT, ILL-DEFINED  UNKNOWN.
 
     They should all be associated with OTHER/MISCELLANEOUS.
 
     Also, these topographies will no longer be prompted for T, N and M 
     coding.  The TNM fields will be stuffed as follows:
 
     CLINICAL T: T88 NA
     CLINICAL N: N88 NA
     CLINICAL M: M88 NA
     CLINICAL STAGE GROUP: NA
     STAGED BY (CLINICAL STAGE): Not staged
 
     MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (PATH): NO
     PATHOLOGIC T: T88 NA
     PATHOLOGIC N: N88 NA
     PATHOLOGIC M: M88 NA
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP: NA
     STAGED BY (PATHOLOGIC STAGE): Not staged
     
 20) E3R #15401 AUTOPSY SUSPENSE
     
     [SUS  *..Casefinding/Suspense ...]
      [CF  Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search]
       [1  All Anatomic Path Labs]
     
     This E3R requested that in the above casefinding option a search for
     Autopsy cases be added.  The changes necessary to include an Autopsy
     search have been added.  This automatic casefinding option will now
     search Lab files for Surgical Pathology, Cytopathology, Electron
     Microscopy and Autopsy cases.
     
 21) Primary Intracranial/CNS Tumors PCE study
     Item 28. WHO HISTOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF TUMOR
 
     The following WHO codes were missing from the WHO HISTOLOGICAL
     CLASSIFICATION (164.9) file:
 
     02.01  SCHWANNOMA
     02.02  NEUROFIBROMA
     02.03  MALIGNANT PERIPHERAL NERVE SHEATH TUMOR
 
     They have been added.
