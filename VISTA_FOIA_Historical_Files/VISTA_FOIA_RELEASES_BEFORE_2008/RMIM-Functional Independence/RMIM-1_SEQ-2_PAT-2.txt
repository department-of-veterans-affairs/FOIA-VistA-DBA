Subject: FIX FOR COMPLETING CONSULTS AND MULTIPLE ADMISSION RECS

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem of consults no longer completing using the 
 FIM tool and multiple admission records displaying for the same admission when 
 linking a progress note.  Both of these problems were introduced in patch 
 RMIM*1.0*1.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 
 1. MOU-1103-30266  FIM process no longer completes consult request
  
 Problem:
 --------
 With version 1.0.2.1 of the FIM GUI installed, the ability to complete a 
 consult has been lost.  The new FIM still prompts for "do you wish to 
 complete a consult with the note?", but the process no longer completes
 the consultation and no corresponding consult note is filed. 
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The problem was introduced while cleaning up local variable names in the GUI 
 code during the development of FIM GUI version 1.0.2.1 in patch RMIM*1.0*1. 
 The problem has been eliminated in version 1.0.3.1 of the FIM GUI.
 
 
 2. MIW-1003-42147  TWO HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS APPEAR WHEN LINKING PROGRESS 
                    NOTE
 
 Problem:
 --------
 With version 1.0.2.1 installed, two hospital admissions appear on the 
 screen when linking a progress note to an admission for an inpatient. 
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Both admission and transfer movement records were being included in the list.
 This has been corrected in version 1.0.3.1 of the GUI.  Only admission 
 records will be included in the list.
