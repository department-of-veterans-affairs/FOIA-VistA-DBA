  Patch Tracking #: FORUM message #40691114 and MS Exchange message

  Kernel is the designated custodial software package of the
  Kernel Authentication & Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE)-related software.
  KAAJEE comprises multiple patches and software releases from several
  VistA applications.
  
  This patch contains the VistA M Server-side components in support of KAAJEE.
  This patch also briefly describes some of the Java Server-side components
  required by KAAJEE but not directly related to the VistA M Server.
  
  
 VistA M Server-side Components: 
 ===============================
  
 The contents of this patch include the following build components: 
  
 Routines:
  
  BUILD COMPONENT: ROUTINE 
  ENTRIES: XUSKAAJ                        ACTION: SEND TO SITE  
  
  
 Options:
  
  BUILD COMPONENT: OPTION 
  ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON           ACTION: SEND TO SITE 
  ENTRIES: XUCOMMAND                      ACTION: USE AS LINK FOR MENU ITEMS 
  
  The XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON is a "B"-type option. This option contains references
  to the following RPCs in its "RPC" multiple:
  
     * XUS ALLKEYS
     * XUS KAAJEE GET USER INFO
     * XUS KAAJEE LOGOUT
     
  This option has no effect on those RPCs as such. However, having this option
  assigned allows KAAJEE to call these RPCs on behalf of the end-user.
  
  The XUCOMMAND "Menu"-type option is only used to link XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON
  to XUCOMMAND.  As all authenticated users have access to XUCOMMAND,
  this linkage enables all users to have access to all RPCs listed
  under the XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON "B"-type option.
  
  
 RPCs:
  
  BUILD COMPONENT: REMOTE PROCEDURE 
  ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE GET USER INFO       ACTION: SEND TO SITE 
  ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE LOGOUT              ACTION: SEND TO SITE
  
  
 Java Server-side Requirements: 
 ==============================
  
  This section should be considered as background information only
  and not directly related to requirements for the VistA M Server-side.
  
  KAAJEE will most likely be deployed on an application server
  at a central location instead of being co-located with the facility
  that hosts the VistA M-based servers.
  
  The KAAJEE software provides the Java server-side authentication component.
  In conjunction with VistALink V. 1.5, it facilitates authentication
  and authorization for Web-based applications via Kernel on a VistA M-server.
  KAAJEE is deployed as a Java Archive (JAR) file along with other components
  (e.g., JavaServer pages [JSP], HyperText Mark-up Language [HTML] pages, etc.)
  inside an application's Enterprise Archive (EAR) file.  The application's EAR
  file is deployed on a J2EE compliant application server.  Currently, KAAJEE
  supports the BEA WebLogic V. 8.1 SP4 Application Server.  
  
  Besides the Vista M Server components listed above, KAAJEE also requires
  external relational databases.  For this requirement, KAAJEE needs
  two sets of schemas:
  
   * One schema must have a replicated clone of the Standard Data Service (SDS)
     tables. The SDS tables in this schema are the authoritative source
     for institution names and station numbers.
  
   * A second schema must have the Principals and GroupMembers tables
     to be used by the KAAJEE Security Service Providers (SSPIs)
     for a temporary user store.  This temporary user store serves as a cache
     for user and role information to be used for authentication
     and authorization purposes.  
  
  For further details regarding KAAJEE requirements, please refer to the KAAJEE
  Deployment and Installation Guides located on the VDL.
