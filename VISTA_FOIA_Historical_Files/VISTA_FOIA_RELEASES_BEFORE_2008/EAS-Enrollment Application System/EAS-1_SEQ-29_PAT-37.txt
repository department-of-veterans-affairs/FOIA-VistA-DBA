Subject: FIX NON VET UE TRANSMISSION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  
 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 This patch addresses a problem whereby Non-Veteran data is transmitted 
 to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) inappropriately.  This issue was 
 introduced in the GEOGRAPHIC MEANS TESTING (GMT) PHASE II suite of patches.  
 The issue was identified in NOIS IVM-0603-32258. This patch will fix the 
 problem of transmitting Non-Veteran User Enrollee data to the HEC.
   
 Routine Changes:
 ================
  
 EASUER: Currently this routine is not filtering Non-Veterans from 
 determination of User Enrollee update status. This allows all Non-Veterans
 User Enrollees to be transmitted to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC). 
 The following routine changes will prevent Non-Veteran User Enrollees from 
 being transmitted to the HEC inappropriately.
