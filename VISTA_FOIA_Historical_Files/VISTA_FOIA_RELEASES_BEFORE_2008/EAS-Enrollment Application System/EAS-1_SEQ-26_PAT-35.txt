 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
               
  This patch can be installed with users on the system.
  
  Install Time - less than 1 minute
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from

 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*35)
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.

    respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond NO. 
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
