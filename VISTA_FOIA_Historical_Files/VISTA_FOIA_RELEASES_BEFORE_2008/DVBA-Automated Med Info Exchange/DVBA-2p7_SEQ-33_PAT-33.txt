Subject: AMIE II - VHA BDN ACCESS MGW CHANGE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This is an informational patch.
                                   
 When AMIE II was deployed local medical facilities were asked to create a
 HOSTS file on the AMIE II client PC's.  The content of the HOSTS file varied
 in order to accommodate load issues on the various Benefits Delivery Network
 (BDN) servers, called Migration Gateways (MGW), at the various Regional
 Offices around the country.  A table containing each Facility Address, Station
 Number and MGW IP Address was published at the AMIE II support page
 http://vaww.its.cio.med.va.gov/amieii/download.htm
                                      
 This information will shortly become incorrect. VBA is upgrading the MGW's
 rendering the HOSTS file addressing scheme incorrect in some, but not all,
 cases.
                                                
 On the AMIE II client machines, the HOSTS file contains an entry as follows,
 where the x's represent the numbers of the formerly correct IP address:
 152.124.xxx.xxx MGW
                                                                
 If this number does not already use the following final IP octet, this number
 should now be changed to read: 
 152.124.xxx.105 MGW
                                                   
 It is recommended that staff proceed with the modification as soon as
 possible.  Although the upgrade is being deployed in a phased fashion, the
 AMIE II traffic has proven to be small enough that we no longer think that
 load is an issue.  The 105 octet will address a currently active server in
 either case.
      
 For Windows 95 workstations, the HOSTS file is located in the C:\Windows
 directory.  
        
 For Windows NT workstations, the HOSTS file is located in the
 C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC directory.
           
 A BDN client was not deployed on Windows 98 machines. But if this is not the
 case for your site, please follow the instructions for Windows 95
 workstations.
                
 The C:\WINNT or C:\Windows directory may have a different name depending upon
 your selection for the NT or Windows 95 installation directory.  C:\WINNT is
 the default for Windows NT 4.0, while C:\Windows is the default for Windows
 95. You may use Find Files or Folders, the Windows tool, to find the HOSTS
 file.
           
 Trouble Shooters and Help Desks may want to understand the symptoms of a
 failure to change the address.  The COTS software used as the BDN client is
 called Softerm.  If the address in the table no longer exists, Softerm will
 report that it "Cannot Find Host." 
           
 If the address exists but is incorrect - a situation that will arise if the
 address used ended in 106, the session will take on a normal appearance.  The
 user will be prompted for a user name and password, but when entered they will
 receive the message "RDP Processing Stopped".
            
 VBA IRM staff and the VBA Help Desk will be acquainted with the problem.
