Subject: GENERIC VA HL LINK

Category: 
  - Enhancement ()

Description: 
============

  The purpose of this patch is to export the VACIO entry in the
  HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.  The VACIO node is distributed
  with data in the following fields.
      NODE: VACIO
      INSTITUTION: OFFICE OF INFORMATION SRV CNTR
      LLP TYPE: TCP
      DOMAIN: MAIL.CIO.MED.VA.GOV
      QUEUE SIZE: 10
      EXCEED RE-TRANSMIT ACTION: restart
      TCP/IP ADDRESS: 152.127.1.6
      TCP/IP PORT: 5000
      TCP/IP SERVICE TYPE: CLIENT (SENDER)
   
  The Government Computerized-Based Patient Record (GCPR) will
  require this enhancement for viewing data from facilities outside
  the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).  Patch RG*1*22 is
  distributed as an EMERGENCY patch because it needs to be in place
  at all facilities to enable GCPR to begin data transmissions in
  October 2001.
   
  Instructions in patch XM*DBA*139 must be followed prior to
  installing patch RG*1*22.  XM*DBA*139 is an informational patch
  with directions for creating the MAIL.CIO.MED.VA.GOV domain.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as CMORs, 
  treating facilities or subscribers.
   
  Test Sites:

  El Paso, TX
  Tennessee Valley HCS
  VA Greater Los Angeles HCS

  Environment Check Routine RGP22ENV:
  ===================================
  The environment check routine, RGP22ENV, checks to see if patch
  XM*DBA*139 is in place.  It does this by checking for the existence
  of the MAIL.CIO.MED.VA.GOV entry in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  If the
  entry is not found, the routine aborts with the following message.
      No DOMAIN (#4.2) file entry was found for MAIL.CIO.MED.VA.GOV.
      Follow the instructions in VA MailMan patch XM*DBA*139 to create
      this new entry in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  After the new DOMAIN
      has been created, re-install patch RG*1*22.
   
  Pre-Install Routine PRE^RGP22:
  ==============================
  The pre-install routine, PRE^RGP22, looks for the OFFICE OF
  INFORMATION SRV CNTR entry in the INSTITUTION (#4) file.  If the
  entry is present, the pre-install is done.  If the entry does not
  exist, it is created.  This entry is pointed to from the HL LOGICAL
  LINK (#870) file by the VACIO entry distributed in this patch.
   
  Post-Install Routine PST^RGP22:
  ===============================
  The post-install routine, PST^RGP22, sets the AUTOSTART (#4.5) field
  to Enabled for the VACIO entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.
  Then, it examines the system to determine if it is the production or
  test account.  If it is the production account, the post-install is
  finished.  If it is a test account, the TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01) and
  DOMAIN (#.03) fields for the VACIO entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870)
  file are removed to ensure that messaging does not occur from a test
  account.
   
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 2 minutes.

      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  The routines for this patch are new and can be deleted after
      installation; therefore routine mapping is not an issue for

      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
