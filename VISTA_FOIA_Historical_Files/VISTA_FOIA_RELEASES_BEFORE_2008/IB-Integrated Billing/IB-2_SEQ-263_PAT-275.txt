 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
 HEC VistA Enhancements (HVE) provides software to support several 
 critical business processes associated with congressionally mandated 
 initiatives. Through the course of a three phase roll-out, a series of 
 system application updates have been and are being made to support 
 enhanced Enrollment functionality, both within VistA and the Health 
 Eligibility Center (HEC), and updates to a series of veterans' 
 enrollments, including continuous enrollment, and eligibilities, 
 including statuses of Combat Veteran, former Prisoner of War (POW), 
 Unemployable Veteran and Filipino Veteran. The patch incorporated into 
 this release is part of the HVE Phase 3 project. 
  
 The HVE Phase 3 project functionality enhancements include:
  
 - Unemployable Veteran Service Connection (SC) Priority Group Change
 - POW Veteran Pharmacy Copayment Exemption and Dental Treatment
 - Filipino Veteran Data Sharing with the HEC
 - Combat Veteran (Phase III) Enrollment Priority Updates and Data Sharing 
 with the HEC
 - Military Service Date (MSD) Sharing with the HEC and
 - Continuous Enrollment Priority Updates
  
 The HVE Phase 3 functionality will be introduced at all sites as part of 
 a combined effort that encompasses updates to: 
  
 - Registration (Patch DG*5.3*564); IVM (IVM*2.0*97); Scheduling 
 (SD*2.0*395) (Distributed as Host File DG_53_P564.KID)
 - Integrated Billing (Patch IB*2.0*275); and 
 - Accounts Receivable (Patch PRCA*4.5*218)
  
 ***********************************************************************
 *       Please be aware that the new functionality  with regard to RX *
 * copays exemptions for former POW and Unemployable veterans will not *
 * be fully functional until DG*5.3*564, IVM*2.0*97 and SD*2.0*395 are *
 * installed and HEC has completed the cleanup/conversion process.     *

 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
  
 The patch addresses the following IB functionality: 
 - billing exemptions for former POW veterans
 - billing exemptions for unemployable veterans
 - notify the billing staff in real time about expiration of the Combat 
 Veteran (CV) status of active inpatients
  
  
 For the billing of former Prisoner Of War veterans, a series of program 
 updates have been made to ensure that Integrated Billing will not create 
 a Rx-copayment bill if a former POW Veteran has been identified as being 
 Rx-copay exemption (DBIA #423). A new reason of POW exemption is being 
 added to explain the exclusion of the bill. Should a former POW have an 
 eligibility status of SC < 50%, Integrated Billing will now mark the 3rd 
 party pharmacy Claim Tracking System records as "Needs SC Determination".
  
  
 For the billing of Unemployable Veterans, a series of program updates 
 have been made to ensure that Integrated Billing will not create a Rx 1st 
 party co-payment bill for an Unemployable SC veteran if the veteran has 
 been identified as one eligible for the Rx-copay exemption (DBIA #423). A 
 new reason of Unemployable Veteran exemption is being added to explain 
 the exclusion of the bill. Should an Unemployable Veteran have an 
 eligibility status of SC < 50%, Integrated Billing will now mark the 3rd 
 party pharmacy Claim Tracking System records as "Needs SC Determination".
  
  
 The IB MT NIGHT COMP job that is tasked to run each night has been 
 modified to scan all inpatients to identify those whose CV End Date 
 expires 'today'. A new bulletin will be sent to the IB MEANS TEST mail 
 group that will list the inpatients identified by that process which will 
 need to be reviewed for billing purposes.
 Here is an example of the bulletin:
