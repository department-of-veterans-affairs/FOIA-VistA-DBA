Description:
============

 New Tortiously Liable and Interagency billing rates for January 2004
 have been published.
                        
 In the past, the Tortiously Liable and Interagency rates were manually     
 added at a site.  This patch will add all the January 2004 charges,        
 therefore manual entry will not be necessary.
  
 The Tortiously Liable rates may also be called Cost Based rates.
                 
 Note that although this is not an update to Reasonable Charges rates, the 
 Tortiously Liable Prescription charge is used for the same payers as 
 Reasonable Charges.  Therefore the Prescription charge billed to these 
 payers is increased by this patch to $45.
  
               
 New Tortiously Liable, Cost Based, and Interagency Charges
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 This patch will install the January 2004 Tortiously Liable, Cost Based
 and, Interagency rates into the Charge Master.  See the Directives for
 the specific charge amounts.
               
 These rates will have an effective date of 01/07/04.  
          
              
 New Billable Bedsection for PRRTP
 ---------------------------------
 There has been one change from previous versions of Tortiously Liable
 and Interagency rates.  A new Billable Bedsection has been added for            
 Psychosocial Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (PRRTP).  
                     
 The following Treating Specialties have been moved from their previous 
 Billable Bedsection to the new PRRTP Billable Bedsection.
           
   Code Treating Specialty              Previous Billable Bedsection
   ---- ----------------------------    ----------------------------
    25  PSYCH RESID REHAB TRMT PROG     PSYCHIATRIC CARE
    26  PTSD RESIDENTIAL REHAB PROG     PSYCHIATRIC CARE
    27  SUBSTANCE ABUSE RES TRMT PROG   ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT

    39  GENERAL CWT/TR                  PSYCHIATRIC CARE
                
 Care on and after the effective date of the new charges in these Treating
 Specialties will be associated with the PRRTP Billable Bedsection.  All
 previous care will continue to be applied to the previous Billable 
 Bedsection.
                                 
                           
 Charges for Tort Feasor Bills
 -----------------------------
 Previously, Tort Feasor type bills were charged using Tortiously Liable
 Charges.  The Directives mentioned above changed the charges to be used
 for Tort Feasor to Reasonable Charges.
          
 Tort Feasor care, that occurs on and after 01/07/04, will be billed using
 Reasonable Charges.

      File Print.  Check to make sure that the following four items, marked
      with >>, show up in the Install File Print exactly as they are shown
      below.
                
      IB*2*175 Post-Install .....
                
        >> 1 Bedsection PRRTP added (399.1)
        >> 61 Tort/Interagency Charge Items added (363.2)
        >> 2 Tort Feasor Rate Schedules inactivated on 1/6/04 (363)
        >> 4 Tort Feasor Rate Schedules added for RC, active 1/7/04 (363)

      added to the Tort Feasor Rate Schedules.
