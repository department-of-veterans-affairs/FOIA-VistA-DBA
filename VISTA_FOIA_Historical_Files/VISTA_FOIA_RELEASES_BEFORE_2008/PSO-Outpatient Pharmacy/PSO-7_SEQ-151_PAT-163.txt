Subject: MAINTENANCE PATCH: DISCONTINUE COMMENTS AND RENEWAL FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This is a Maintenance patch that will resolve the following NOIS calls.
 
 1. DAY-1202-41933
    An internal problem in the software was causing the content of the
    comment field, entered when a prescription was discontinued, to be 
    replaced by a 0 (zero). This problem was detected when printing the
    Activity Log for the discontinued prescription. The comment field for
    the DISCONTINUED activity was displaying a 0 (zero) instead of the 
    original comments entered by the user who discontinued the
    prescription. This issue will be resolved by verifying the correct
    comment is stored within the prescriptions activity.
 
 2. SPO-0104-50404
    An internal problem in the software was causing an error during the
    Renewal process. This error occurred when a Transitional Pharmacy
    Benefit prescription was renewed and the PATIENT STATUS field (#3)
    of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) had not previously been set.
    This issue will be resolved by checking the PATIENT STATUS field (#3)
    during the renewal process.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Users can be on the system at the time of installation. It is
  recommended that this patch be installed after normal business hours.
 
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*163)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*163.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
