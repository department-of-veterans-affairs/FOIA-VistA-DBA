 OVERVIEW
 ========
 This patch will add consistency checks to the ORF/ORU Z11 upload process
 in order to notify Billing/AR personnel of changes to Veteran's C&P and
 SC status.
  
 The following consistency checks will be added:
 ==============================================
  
    1. When the SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE changes from NULL or less than
       50% to a value of 50% or greater the following message will be
       generated: "VETERAN SC% CHANGED TO 50% OR GREATER".
  
    2. When the VA PENSION indicator is changed the following message will
       be generated: "VETERAN VA PENSION CHANGED".
  
    3. When the SERVICE CONNECTED indicator changes the following message
       will be generated: "VETERAN SC INDICATOR CHANGED".
  
    4. When the RATED DISABILITY CONDITION changes the following message
       will be generated: "VETERAN RATED DISABILITIES CHANGED".
  
    NOTE: The messages generated above will be sent to the 'IB MEANS TEST'
          mail group.  It is the responsibility of each site to ensure all
          required members are added to this mail group (see 'POST
          IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS' section).
