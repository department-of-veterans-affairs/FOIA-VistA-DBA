Description: 
============

 This patch implements a field request that was approved by the ITAC
 Screening Committee.  The request was for the Integrated Patient Funds
 package to be modified to allow for the sorting of various reports by
 division.
  
 When facilities (divisions) are integrated into one multidivisional 
 station, (sometimes called a VISN), all reports are combined into one 
 large VISN-wide report. Divisions are unable to run a report for their 
 facility without getting all of the other facilities in the VISN. Without 
 a division sort, it is not possible to tell which division has which 
 patient's funds.  Reports are currently being run based on the name of 
 the Patient Funds Clerk. To know where the patient is, one must first 
 know which clerk works at which facility and then find that clerk in the 
 entire VISN report. Reconciliations that had been verified on a daily 
 basis before integration, are now done monthly. Some of the smaller 
 facilities are doing daily manual reconciliations, but these are based 
 on the individual clerk's daily record, and are vulnerable to human error.
 Errors may not be discovered until the End of Month Reconciliation 
 Report, which is a VISN-wide report, is run. Monthly reconciliations are 
 done because the required labor for sorting and reconciling accounts 
 cannot be managed on a daily basis. When there is a problem, or a question
 regarding a specific account, the only recourse at this time is to do a 
 manual search by patient name. Being able to sort reports by division 
 will enable computerized reconciliation reports to be run on a daily 
 basis, and will make problem-solving issues more easily managed.
  
 Additionally, current reports do not include a privacy statement that 
 warns about the unauthorized use of the information on the report. Most 
 of the reports contain private patient information, including the Social 
 Security number and personal financial information.
  
 This modification allows the Patient Funds clerks to add the VISN, (or 
 Primary Station), and division identifiers to a patient's account record 
 in order to know where the patient is primarily located, and to be able to
 run reports by identifier. The VISN and division identifier will make it
 possible to locate patient funds at other VISNs, or stations, that 
 integrate.
