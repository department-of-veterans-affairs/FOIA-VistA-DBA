 For a complete listing of the documents VACO supplied for this project

 Patch Description:
 The Person Class file has been mapped in accordance with the Health Care
 Financing Administration (HCFA) provider taxonomy.  To comply with this
 requirement, all VISTA providers will need to be updated in the Person
 Class file as identified by the approved X12N taxonomy.
  
 Background Information:
 The Insurance Subcommittee of the American National Standards Institute,
 Accredited Standards Committee X12 was tasked with creating an
 all-encompassing Provider Classification System, which would impact how
 provider information is being reported. The X12N  Task Group 2 Workgroup
 15 and the HCFA National Provider System (NPS) Workgroup commenced work on
 identifying and coding an external provider table, which would codify
 provider type and provider area of specialization for all medical related
 providers. . The proposed hierarchy focused on classifying the providers
 into aggregate groupings around services, provider types, and areas of
 specialization or focus.  The taxonomy represents a one-to-many
 relationship to the individual provider (many occurrences of the taxonomy
 may apply to a single entity/provider).  The proposed hierarchy of
 provider categories incorporates four areas of  provider classifications
 that, when used in concert with one another, create the capability to sort
 providers into broad and specific categories.  The hierarchy is: *
 Provider Type (2 byte alphanumeric) * Classification Code (2 byte
 alphanumeric) * Area of Specialization (5 byte alphanumeric) *
 Training/Education Requirement Indicator (1 byte alphanumeric).
