Subject: REVIEWING BUSINESS RULES BEFORE EDITING SIGNED DOCUMENTS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch addresses a number of issues relating to the 
 editing of signed documents.  It deals with concerns brought up in a 
 recent NOIS, and issues brought up by a recent change in VHA 
 regulations.  Specific recommendations are made regarding the 
 modification of business rules to satisfy the requirements of the new 
 regulations.
  
 A problem was reported in NOIS call TUA-0104-31822 where a cosigner 
 edited a signed progress note, and the note got corrupted.  The practice 
 of editing a document that was signed by the author might have a patient
 safety implication and should not be allowed.  This patch is a reminder to
 medical centers to review if Authorization Subscription Utility (ASU)
 business rules are in compliance with disallowing the editing of a
 document that was signed by the author or awaiting co-signature.  Once a
 document is completed, it should not be edited; additional documentation
 should be added to the original document by addenda.  Sites need to remove
 business rules that allow expected cosigners to edit signed and uncosigned
 documents.
  
 TIU does not have a category "signed," however, the following categories 
 are considered signed: Un-cosigned, completed, amended, and retracted. 
 According to the VHA Handbook 1907.1, no one may edit any document in
 these categories.
  
 Note:
 =====
 This patch only addresses the cosigner issue of NOIS TUA-0104-31822.  The 
 issue of lost and truncated text when authors edit their own unsigned 
 notes that was reported in this same NOIS is being addressed with the 
 release of CPRS GUI V24 and the pending release of CPRS GUI V25 and an 
 RPC Broker patch (XWB*1.1*35) that will be released in the near future.
  
 These rules are quoted from VHA HANDBOOK 1907.1. 
   http://vaww1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=434
 Please review these business rules for compliance.
  
 Rules on signature:    
 ==================
 VHA Handbook 1907.1 - Health Information Management and Health Records  
              1907.1, 7f - Electronic Signature 
  
 Currently, there are three types of signatures in the electronic health 
 record:
  
 (1) A "signer" is the author of the document.  Once a document is signed, 
 it cannot be edited; additional documentation can be added to the 
 original document by addenda. 
  
 (2) A "co-signer" is the attending, staff, or supervising clinician.  A 
 co-signer may also be a service chief or designee as defined by the 
 organization's Bylaws and/or policies.  A co-signer may edit and 
 authenticate a document if the author has not already signed the 
 document. 
  
 (3) "Identified signer" and "additional signer" are synonymous and are a 
 communication tool used to alert a clinician about information pertaining 
 to the patient. This functionality is designed to allow clinicians to 
 call attention to specific documents and for the recipient to acknowledge 
 receipt of the information. Being identified as an additional signer does 
 not constitute a co-signature.  This nomenclature in no way implies 
 responsibility for the content of or concurrence with the note. NOTE: 
 "Identified signer" is nomenclature used by CPRS, VistA, and TIU; 
 "additional signer" is nomenclature used by GUI.
  
 Rules on Addendum:
 =================
 VHA Handbook 1907.1 - Health Information Management and Health Records  
              1907.1, 7g - Health Record Alterations and Modifications
  
 An addendum to a patient note or summary is made when a clinician deems 
 it important to clarify information recorded in the original document or 
 to add to the original document. The addendum option can be utilized by 
 practitioners to continue ongoing treatment discussions, or by 
 supervising practitioners to validate the plan of care. 
  
 a. Addenda are linked to originally created documents; 
  
 b. Addenda must be authenticated in an approved manner; and 
  
 c. Addenda may be entered by someone other than the author.  The original 
 author and/or co-signer may be alerted to this action if appropriate TIU 
 functionality is activated, specifically the "SEND ALERTS ON ADDENDA" 
 parameter within the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERS file (8925.95).  For note 
 titles where addenda are routinely added, such as discharge plans, 
 resident physician notes with supervision comments, or initial assessment 
 notes, this parameter would typically be turned off.
  
 Notes on rule compliance: 
 ========================
  
 TIU does not have a category "signed," however, the following categories 
 are considered signed: Un-cosigned, completed, amended, and retracted. 
 According to the VHA Handbook 1907.1, no one may edit any document in
 these categories.
