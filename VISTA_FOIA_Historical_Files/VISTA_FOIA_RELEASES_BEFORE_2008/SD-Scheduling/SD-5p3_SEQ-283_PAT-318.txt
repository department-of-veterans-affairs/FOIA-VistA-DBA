Subject: Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Deferred Appointment Report

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This report was requested in support of the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit 
 project.
 
 It should be tested as a required addition to PSO*7.0*153.
 
 It will be used by each medical center to report the number of 
 patients who have rescheduled their primary care appointment until the 
 medication supplied under the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit program is 
 exhausted.
 
 A query is made to the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package to get a list of 
 TPB eligible patients for a given date range. From this list, the patients' 
 appointments are examined to determine if they have cancelled or not attended 
 their appointments and then been rebooked to TPB associated clinics. If so, 
 their cancellation and rebook details are displayed. Otherwise the 
 appointment closest to the report run date is shown.
 
 This patch adds a new option, Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Deferred Appt 
 Report [SD TRANS RX CANC APPT REPORT] to the Outputs menu [SDOUTPUT].
 
 Routine SDPHARM1, which provides scheduling information to the Outpatient 
 Pharmacy V 7.0 package, has been updated to use the new Scheduling 
 Application Programmer Interface calls, instead of direct global reads to 
 retrieve data from the APPOINTMENT subfile (#2.98) of the PATIENT file 
 (#2).
 
 This patch removes the routines SDPBE and SDPHARM which generated 
 information on Transitional Pharmacy Benefits Eligibility in an earlier 
 phase of the project and are no longer required.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 3 minutes.
  
 Routine SDPHARM1, which provides scheduling information to the Outpatient 
 Pharmacy V 7.0 package, has been updated to use the new Scheduling 
 Application Programmer Interface calls, instead of direct global reads to 
 retrieve data from the APPOINTMENT subfile (#2.98) of the PATIENT file 
 (#2).
 
 Since this patch exports a routine that is invoked from various Outpatient 
 Pharmacy options, this patch should be installed when Outpatient Pharmacy 
 users are not on the system.
 
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*318).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*318.
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//" respond NO. 
  
  7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
  
  9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
