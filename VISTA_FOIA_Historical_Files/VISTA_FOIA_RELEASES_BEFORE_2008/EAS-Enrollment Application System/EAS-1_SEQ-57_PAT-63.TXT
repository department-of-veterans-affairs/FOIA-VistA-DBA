Subject: UPDATE EAS MT LETTERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 With this patch (EAS*1.0*63), the 0 day and the 30 day MT Renewal 
 Letters of the VA Applications for Health Benefits will have the 
 references to the enclosures of the 10-10EZR form and envelope removed
 from each of these letters.  The 0 day and 30 day letters will advise
 veterans how to obtain an EZR if one is needed.
  
 The pre-install routine ^EAS163P in this patch (EAS*1.0*63) will update
 the INITIAL SECTION OF LETTER (#3 field) in the EAS MT LETTERS #713.3
 file for the following letters:  0-DAY LETTER and 30-DAY LETTER.
  
 The text in the INITIAL SECTION OF LETTER field in these two EAS MT
 LETTERS will be changed so that the first bullet under "What Do You
 Need To Do?" will not refer to the (no longer) enclosed VA Form 10-10EZR.
 Rather, instructions on how to obtain this form will be given.  The text
 of each letter will now be as follows:
  
 NAME: 0-DAY LETTER
 ==================
 According to our records you have not responded to our previous requests
 to complete the financial section of VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits
 Renewal Form. This is to inform you that your current financial
 assessment (means test) has expired.
  
 How Does This Affect Your Eligibility for Cost Free Care?
   o We do not have a current means test for you on file as is required to
     determine your eligibility for either cost-free care or reduced
     inpatient copayments.
  
 How Does This Affect Your Enrollment?
   o We are unable to determine your priority for enrollment in the VA
     health care system.
  
 What Do You Need To Do?
   o Complete a new VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits Renewal Form, 
     including the financial section as soon as possible and return it to
     the Business Office at the address above.  You may obtain this form by
     contacting our Business Office or by downloading the form from our
     website at:  http://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp.
   o Read the enclosed VA Form 4107VHA, Your Rights to Appeal Our Decision.
     If you disagree with our decision, you or your representative may
     complete a Notice of Disagreement and return it to the Enrollment
     Coordinator or Health Benefits Advisor at your local VA health care
     facility.
  
 What If You Have Questions?
  
 NOTE:  The "What If You Have Questions" section of the EAS MT Letters
 is a site-added text message that can be updated using the Edit 
 Final Section of Letters [EAS MT LETTERS EDIT] option as your site deems 
 necessary.
  
 NAME: 30-DAY LETTER
 ===================
 Each year VA requires most nonservice-connected veterans and 0% service-
 connected veterans to complete a financial assessment (means test).  Our
 records show that your annual means test is due.
  
 As of this date we have not received the updated financial income
 information we requested in a previous letter.
  
 What Does This Mean To You?
   o An updated means test is needed to determine your ability to pay
     copayments for your medical care and medications and your priority for
     enrollment in the VA health care system.
   o Failure to complete the means test by the anniversary date will cause
     your priority for enrollment in the VA health care system to lapse.
  
 What Do You Need To Do?
   o Complete, sign and return a new VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits
     Renewal Form, including the financial section.  You may obtain 
     this form by contacting our Business Office or by downloading the
     form from our website at: http://www.va.gov/vaforms/search_action.asp.
     Return the completed and signed form to the Business Office at the
     address above before your means test anniversary date.
   o When you report to your next health care appointment, bring your 
     health insurance card so we may update your health insurance
     information.
   o Notify us if you feel you received this letter in error.
