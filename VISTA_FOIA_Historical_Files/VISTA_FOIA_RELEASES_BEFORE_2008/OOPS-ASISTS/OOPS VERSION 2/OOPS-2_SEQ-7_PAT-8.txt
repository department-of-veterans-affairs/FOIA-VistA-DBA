Subject:  ASISTS NOIS AND ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide fixes and updates to the ASISTS GUI.
  
 This patch contains a new GUI version, which needs to be installed by
 running the OOPS2_8.EXE file. Once the files have been installed they can 
 be copied or moved to other locations without further requirement to run the 
 installation program.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 AUG-0304-32633           What is quick report
 When a user runs the Incident Report Option and minimizes the report display 
 and then tries to run it again they receive an error message that 'A 
 component named quick report already exists'. Only one report can be run 
 at a time, therefore, modifications have been made to the Incident Report 
 Option so that the report must be closed before it can be run again. A 
 message is displayed notifying the user to close the open report.
  
 LOU-0102-40050           DATE/TIME INJURY OCCURED WRONG
 This NOIS reports problems with how the Date/Time Injury occurred is 
 working.  The ASISTS Technical Advisory Group (TAG) has determined new 
 functional requirements for the following four fields in the ASISTS 
 ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260):  DATE/TIME OF OCCURRANCE (field # 4), 
 DATE/TIME INJURY OCCURRED (field #109), DATE OF THIS NOTICE (field # 110), 
 and the DATE OF NOTICE RECEIVED (field #175). The details of the 
 modifications can be found in item #3 under TAG enhancements below.  
  
   
 This patch addresses the following unreported bugs:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1. In the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 and Complete/Validate/Sign CA2 options 
 error checking has been added so that if Retirement is changed from 'Other' 
 to a different value, the Retirement Description field is cleared (data 
 removed) to maintain data integrity.
  
 2. In the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 option, if the response to field 
 'Employee's Willful Misconduct, Intoxication, or Intent to Injure Self or 
 Another :' is changed from Yes to No, error checking has been added to 
 remove the text in the Explain the misconduct field to maintain data 
 integrity.
  
 3. Additional error checking has been incorporated in the Edit Site 
 Parameter option to ensure that a station selected for editing is 'active'.
  
 4. The Create Accident Illness Report (2162) Option has been modified to 
 allow entry of the date of birth (DOB) and/or the gender (SEX) of an 
 employee if either of those fields are not populated in the PAID Employee 
 Master File (#450).
  
 5. The Incident Report Option under the Reports Menu on the Employee 
 Health, Safety, and Workers' Comp menus does not properly print an Excel 
 Spreadsheet.  When the Print button is clicked the spreadsheet displays to 
 the screen but does not print.  This has been corrected so that when the 
 Print button is clicked, the spreadsheet is sent to the printer and is not 
 displayed.
  
 6. Error checking has been incorporated on all Zip Code / State fields in 
 ASISTS (in the options: Create Accident/Illness Report, Complete/Validate/Sign 
 Accident Report (2162), Complete/Validate/Sign CA1, the Witness Form Zip and 
 State when entered in the CA1, Complete/Validate/Sign CA2, and the Request 
 for Compensation (CA7)) to ensure that the Zip Code exists (in the ZIP CODE 
 File (#5.11)) and that it is valid for the corresponding State field (the 
 State entered by the user is the state listed for that Zip Code). The error 
 checking is done at the time the claim is signed (not when the save button 
 is clicked). This should help to reduce errors reported when claims are 
 submitted electronically to DOL.
  
 This patch addresses the following Technical Advisory Group (TAG) 
 requested Enhancements:
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Expand the OWCP Chargeback code to accept 4 numeric and 2 alpha 
 characters. A new field has been added for the OWCP Chargeback Code 
 Suffix. This will enable an entry from the approved Department of Labor 
 (DOL) Chargeback code table and the entry of a free text 2 character 
 suffix. The suffix is not required, but if entered, will be appended to 
 the chargeback code when it is displayed. This new field can be entered on 
 the OWCP tab in the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 and Complete/Validate/Sign 
 CA2 Options. 
  
 The Edit Site Parameter option has also been modified to allow entry of the 
 OWCP Chargeback Suffix in the Default Physician form when adding or editing 
 a Station. When a Suffix is entered for a station, it will be the default 
 value for that station in the CA-1 or CA-2 options.
  
 A post-init routine will be run to auto-populate the new 6 alphanumeric 
 character field with the existing OWCP Chargeback code.
  
 2. Modifications have been made to how block 36 is completed on the
 CA-1 Form. The changes have been made to the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 
 Option and impact the following tabs: Work Schedule, Third Party, and 
 Physician. These new changes can be seen from the Supervisor, Safety and 
 Workers' Compensation menus.
  
 The nine (9) Reasons for Controverting the claim (from the last 
 page of the printed form) have been added to the Physician tab. If the 
 response to the 'Does the agency controvert this claim' question is Yes, 
 one (1) of the reasons for controvert must be selected in order to sign the 
 CA1. If the response to the 'Does the agency dispute this claim' question 
 is yes, then a free text entry in the 'State the Reason for Dispute in 
 Detail' memo box is required in order to sign the CA1.  If either of the 
 Yes/No questions are changed from Yes to No, then the entry in corresponding 
 field is removed (blanked) to maintain data integrity. The 'Does the 
 agency controvert this claim' is required while the 'Does the agency dispute 
 this claim' is not in order to sign the CA1.
   
 The system will now append the 'Reason for Controvert' text to the text 
 entered in the dispute field when the CA-1 is printed and when the claim 
 is sent to DOL. Therefore, while the total maximum number of characters 
 that can be entered in the dispute field is 528, the number of characters 
 in the actual dispute field is reduced by the number of characters in the 
 selected Reason for Controvert' text, if entered. If the agency does not 
 controvert the claim but does dispute it then 528 total characters can be 
 entered in the dispute field.
  
 Adding the 'Reason for Controvert' question on the Physician tab required 
 moving fields to the Work Schedule and Third Party tabs. The Pay Rate 
 when Employee Stopped Work and Per fields were moved to the Work Schedule 
 tab.  The prompts: Date Employee first received medical care, Do medical 
 reports show employee is Disabled for Work, Does your Knowledge of the 
 Facts agree with Statements of the Employee, and Explanation were moved to 
 the Third Party tab.
  
 3. Modifications have been made in the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 option to 
 the Date of this Notice on the Employee tab, the Date/Time Injury Occurred 
 on the Injury/Witness tab, the Date/Time of Injury and the Date of Notice 
 Received on the Work Schedule tab. The Date/Time Injury Occurred and the 
 Date/Time of Injury are populated with the Date/Time of Occurrence from the 
 Stub Record and can no longer be edited. If either of these dates are 
 incorrect, the claim status should be changed to deleted and a new claim 
 entered with the correct date. The Date of Notice Received cannot be before 
 the Date of this Notice and both notice dates cannot be before the Date/Time 
 of Injury in order to sign the CA1.
  
 4. Modifications have been made to the Station Number lookup in the 
 following options: Create Accident/Illness Report, Complete/Validate/Sign 
 Accident Report (2162), Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 (Duty Station), 
 Complete/Validate/Sign CA2 (Duty Station), Edit/Validate Stub Record 
 (Employee Health Menu), Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, 
 Log of Needlestick Incidents, Print Accident Report Status, Incident 
 Reports, and the new (see below) Filing Instructions Report (Workers' Comp 
 Menu only). This enhancement works the same way in each option regardless 
 of the menu the option it is called from. The intent of this modification 
 is to make selecting a station number easier.  
  
 The stations entered in the Edit Site Parameter Option will be used to 
 build the default list of stations that can be selected in any of the 
 options listed above. Additionally, there will be an entry, 'All Stations'. 
 If the user selects 'All Stations', ASISTS will retrieve all the stations in 
 the Institution File (#4). This will enable selecting stations from a 
 pre-determined 'short' list  of 'valid' choices or from all stations, if 
 needed. If a station that is not entered in Edit Site Parameter option is 
 selected (from the 'All Stations' list), it will be the default value (if 
 the data is saved) the next time that option is accessed. 
  
 In the Create Accident Illness Report option once the 'All Station' choice  
 is selected, the short list will no longer be available.  The user will  
 need to select from all the stations or exit the option without saving and 
 start over OR complete the claim and edit the station using the 
 Complete/Validate/Sign Accident Report (2162) option.
  
 If a station is selected from the 'All Stations' list from an option other 
 than the Create Accident Illness Report, Log of Federal Occupational 
 Injuries and Illnesses, Log of Needlestick Incidents, Print Accident 
 Report Status, Incident Reports, or the Filing Instructions Report, the 
 'short' station list will be restored after the data is saved and refreshed.
  
 The only difference between the Duty Station field in the 
 Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 option and the Complete/Validate/Sign CA2 option 
 is how the list is generated now using the 'short' station list. The logic 
 for filling 'blank' fields in the Duty Station and Agency fields has not 
 been changed.
  
 5. Added a new menu option, the Filing Instructions Report, only on the 
 Workers' Compensation menu. This report allows the user to enter a Start 
 Date, End Date, and either all stations or a single station. The report 
 can be printed to a printer or previewed on the screen. The report counts the 
 number of occurrences of each type of filing instruction (ASISTS ACCIDENT 
 REPORTING File, #2260, field #174): No lost time and no medical expenses, 
 No lost time, medical expensed incurred, Lost time covered by leave LWOP 
 or COP, First aid injury, and No Data Entered for all CA-1 claims in the 
 report date range. The report includes both open and closed cases in the 
 date range.
  
 6. The Edit Site Parameter option has been added to the Workers' 
 Compensation menu.
  
 7. Modifications have been made to the Complete/Validate/Sign Accident 
 Report (2162) on the General Settings tab. Two (2) new fields have been 
 added, the Body Part Group and the Additional Body Part Group. These two 
 fields have similar functionality and allow the user to narrow the entries 
 in the Body Part Most Affected and Additional Body Part Most Affected 
 list to help make the selection process easier. When a selection is made 
 in the Body Part Group list, the entries in the Body Part Most Affected 
 list are limited to a smaller group of body parts. If no Body Part Group is 
 selected, the entire list of ASISTS DOL ANATOMICAL LOCATION CODES File 
 (#2261.1) is used to populate the Body Part Most Affected list. If the Body 
 Part Group is changed, the Body Part Most Affected is blanked.  This is 
 also true for the Additional Body Part fields. This will help to ensure data 
 integrity. The body part group to body part internal mapping was determined 
 by the ASISTS TAG.
  
 8. Modifications have been made to the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 and 
 Complete/Validate/Sign CA2 to enable and require the employee to complete 
 and sign the Dual Benefits form and for the Workers' Compensation (WC) 
 specialist to counter-sign. After the employee indicates that they have 
 read and understood the bill of rights when accessing a claim, the new Dual 
 Benefits form is presented for employee completion. The employee must 
 indicate if they are a Veteran or not.
  
 If they are a Veteran, then they must indicate if they are currently 
 receiving military benefits and/or if they have a pending claim. If the 
 response to either of these questions is Yes, then the employee must enter 
 the Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA) Number, the body parts involved in 
 the claim, and the condition accepted in the claim.
  
 The employee is the only one who can complete these questions and sign the 
 employee portion of the Dual Benefits form. The Dual Benefits form does 
 not have to be signed when completing it or the CA-1 or CA-2, but it must 
 be signed by the employee before the employee can sign their portion of the 
 CA-1 or CA-2. If the employee exits the Dual Benefit form, enters the CA 
 form and then wants to re-access the Dual Benefits form, all they need to 
 do is re-select the CA claim and then the Dual Benefits form will be 
 presented again.
  
 If the employee has signed the Dual Benefits form and re-accesses the CA 
 claim, the system will prompt them: 'You have already signed the Dual 
 Benefit form, do you wish to edit?'. A No response results in immediate 
 access to the CA claim, a Yes response removes their signature and presents 
 the Dual Benefits form for editing. The employee can access the Dual 
 Benefits form as long as they have not signed the CA claim and the WC 
 specialist has not counter-signed the Dual Benefits form.  The WC 
 specialist can only view the information entered by the employee and can 
 only sign after the employee has signed the Dual Benefits form. Once the 
 WC Specialist has signed the Dual Benefits form, it is not presented again 
 to either the employee or WC specialist. 
  
 Error checking when electronically signing the Dual Benefits form is 
 similar to the other ASISTS forms.
  
 The Dual Benefits form can be printed directly from the Dual Benefits form 
 or from a separate menu option, Print Dual Benefit Form which has been added 
 to the Employee and WC menus.
  
 9. The ability to complete a new form has been provided.  The CA-7 form can 
 now be completed by the employee and WC specialist. A new menu option, 
 Request For Compensation (CA7), has been added to the Employee and WC 
 menus. At this time, the CA-7 must be mailed or faxed to DOL, it cannot be 
 electronically transmitted although that enhancement may be made in the 
 future.
  
 In conjunction with this enhancement a new menu option has been added to 
 the Employee and WC menu to print a CA7, called Print CA7. Additionally, 
 the Print Blank CA1/CA2 on the WC menu (only) has been modified to print 
 a blank CA7. On the WC menu, the option name has been changed to Print 
 Blank CA1, CA2 or CA7.
  
 In order for a CA-7 case to be created, it must be linked to an existing 
 CA-1 or CA-2 and there can be multiple CA-7 cases for each CA. The CA-7 has 
 been organized by the Sections on the hardcopy form.
  
 From the Employee menu, when an employee selects the Request For 
 Compensation (CA7) option, the first tab of a CA-7 is displayed. A 
 selection box similar to the CA-1 and CA-2 has a list of existing CA-7 
 cases for that employee.  The employee can select an existing claim or 
 click the 'New' button to create a new CA-7.  If a new CA-7 is 
 created, the user will be asked which CA to link it to by providing a list 
 of that employee's existing open and closed CA-1's and CA-2's.
  
 The employee will then be able to complete and sign the information on 
 page 1 of the hard copy CA-7 form dated Nov. 1999. A new CA-7 case must be 
 created for each type of compensation being requested from Section 2 of the 
 CA-7. The employee will be able to electronically sign the CA-7 and will be 
 able to edit it as long as the WC specialist has not also signed the CA-7.  
 In Section 5, up to three (3) dependents can be entered.
  
 From the WC menu, the WC specialist must first select an employee to work 
 with before being able to select a CA-7. Therefore a form similar to the 
 employee lookup form will be presented for the user to select the 
 individual to work with. Once the individual is selected, a list of CA-7's 
 will populate the selection list (like the CA-1 and CA-2) so the user can 
 choose an existing CA-7 to work with. If the WC specialist needs to 
 initiate a new CA-7 for that individual, the 'New' button would be clicked 
 and the user would be presented with a list of open and closed CA-1's and 
 CA-2's for that person. The user would select the existing CA and the 
 system would display a new (mostly blank) CA-7 to be completed. The WC 
 specialist can complete both the employee (page 1) and the agency portion 
 (page 2) of the CA-7 but CANNOT sign for the employee. 
  
 In Section 8 on page 2 of the CA-7, up to three (3) Additional Pay Types 
 can be entered for both the Date of Injury and Date Employee Stopped Work 
 areas.  Section 10 will be 'pulled' from the Employee Master PAID File 
 (#450), fields FEGLI CODE (#226) and HEALTH INSURANCE (#231).
  
 Once the WC specialist has signed the CA-7 case, the employee cannot access 
 it.  However, the WC specialist can access the case.  If the WC specialist 
 selects a case they have previously signed their electronic signature will 
 be removed and they will need to re-sign the case.
  
 The CA-7 does not have a case status so nothing 'closes' the case.  It will 
 be the responsibility of the WC specialist to ensure cases are properly 
 signed by the employee as well as themselves.
