 This patch fixes the following problems:
  
 1) The notification letters may not print the entire street address
    portion of a patient's mailing address. Patient's can have up to 3
    lines of text stored as the street portion of their mailing address in
    the Patient file (#2). The notification letters print the first line of
    a patient's street address only. Some patients have a second or even
    third line for their street address. This patch will allow the
    notification to display the second and third street address lines if
    those values exist. In addition, this change will format the street
    address, city, state and zip code into one "window" or placeholder that
    can be entered into a form letter template to display the patient's
    entire mailing address.
  
    A post-installation routine will go through each form letter entry in
    the WV NOTIFICATION PURPOSE file (#790.404) and replace the current
    placeholders (i.e., |MAILING ADDRESS-STREET|, |MAILING ADDRESS-CITY|,
    |MAILING ADDRESS-STATE| and |MAILING ADDRESS-ZIP|) with the single new
    placeholder (i.e., |COMPLETE ADDRESS|). Also, the generic form letter
    stored in the WV LETTER file (#790.6) is changed to use the new
    placeholder. The generic form letter is used to create new or totally
    replace existing form letters.
  
    Adding and editing form letter templates is done through the Add/Edit a
    Notification Purpose & Letter [WV ADD/EDIT NOT PURPOSE&LETTER] option.
  
    Letters can be printed through the following options:
      Print Individual Letters [WV PRINT INDIVIDUAL LETTERS]
      Print Queued Letters [WV PRINT QUEUED LETTERS]
      Add a New Notification [WV ADD A NEW NOTIFICATION] 
      Edit a Notification [WV EDIT NOTIFICATION].

 2) The Print Notification Purpose & Letter File [WV PRINT NOTIF
    PURPOSE&LETTER] option executes form feeds incorrectly only when the
    output is sent to a printer. Each entry should begin printing on a new
    page. However, sometimes an entry will not execute a form feed and will
    begin printing on the same page as the previous entry. This patch
    corrects the problem. Also, this patch replaces the print template
    previously used with a routine to generate the output and deletes the
    print template.

 3) A null subscript error can occur when the Radiology/NM package
    sends radiology procedure data to the Women's Health (WH) package. The
    WH code assumes that every Radiology/NM procedure has a CPT code
    associated with it, but that is not the case. This patch will prevent
    the null subscript error. 
  
    No WH options are associated with this fix. The Radiology/NM package
    calls a WH API whenever a radiology report is verified.
