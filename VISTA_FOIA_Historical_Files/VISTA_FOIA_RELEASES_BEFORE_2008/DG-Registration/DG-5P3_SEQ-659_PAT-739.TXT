Subject: DISABLE ADT MESSAGES TO AAC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) HL7 messages are currently sent 
 to Austin Automation Center (AAC).  These messages are triggered during 
 admission, discharge or transfer of a patient.  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to discontinue sending ADT messages to
 the AAC. This request originated from National Data Systems in Austin
 and has been endorsed by Gail Graham, Director, Health Data and
 Informatics (HD&I).
  
 It has been verified that the quality of the data in the HL7 ADT 
 transmission from VistA to AAC is not reliable.  In addition, the data 
 sets do not provide a full patient record description for inpatients.  
 Permission has been received from the users of this information to 
 discontinue support of these transmissions. 
  
 Effective 8/11/05, the AAC discontinued loading the HL7 ADT data on
 NPCD.  Also effective 8/11/05, the weekly extract of HL7 ADT data from
 NPCD was discontinued.
  
 This patch will stop the ADT HL7 transmissions from VistA to AAC.
 It will not affect the transmission of ADT HL7 messages to other
 subscribers.
  
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  
 1.) Most sites will not have the DG PTF ADT-A19 protocol. If it is not
     present, the installation display will show that it is not found.
  
 2.) No entries will be deleted from the PROTOCOL file (#101). Client 
     protocols are removed from the ITEM and SUBSCRIBERS multiples.
