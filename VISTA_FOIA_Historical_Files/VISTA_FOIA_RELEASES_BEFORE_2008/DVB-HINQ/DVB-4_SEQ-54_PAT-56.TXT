Subject: HINQ PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch is being issued in response to Patient Safety Issue PSI-05-120.
 Due to the changes in the patient look-up algorithms at the VBA a HINQ
 request could have data returned belonging to a different patient. This
 would happen when a claim number for a veteran matched another veteran's
 Social Security Number or Service Number. To lessen the potential impact
 of this possibility, the user will get a warning and display if any of the
 identifier fields from the HINQ response differ from the values in the
 local VistA database. The identifier fields are Name, Date of Birth, Sex
 and Social Security Number. In addition, the ability to update Sex and
 Date of Birth through the HINQ package has been removed. (Name and SSN
 already cannot be edited through HINQ.) The user will be told that the
 HINQ data might be that of another veteran, and asked whether to update,
 take no action at this time or delete the Suspense file entry. The default
 will be to take no action at this time.
  
 This patch will also allow a user, while Updating HINQs to the Patient
 file [DVB HUPLOAD] to exit after choosing to update all records.  
 Currently once a user selects "All" records to update there is no way to
 exit until all the records have been processed. This change will allow the
 user to exit by using an "^" at the prompt asking if the current patient
 is the patient to update or, in the case of a patient with the warning
 screen, at the prompt asking if the patient should be processed.

 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy tickets:

 HD0000000124842 - HINQ Upload Patient Safety Issue
   
   
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Tickets:
 ----------------------------
   
   Ticket #: HD0000000124842 - HINQ Upload Patient Safety Issue
   
    Problem: VBA has recently updated their patient look-up
             algorithm.  Under certain circumstances, a claim
             number for a veteran can be matched to another
             veteran's Social Security Number or Service Number.
             This can cause data not associated with a veteran to
             be uploaded for that veteran during HINQ.
   
    Resolution: If any of the identifier fields (Name, Date of
                Birth, Sex, and Social Security Number) from the
                HINQ response differ from the values in the local
                VistA database, the user will be told that the HINQ
                data might be that of another veteran.  They will
                then have the option to update, take no action at
                this time or delete the Suspense file entry. The
                default will be to take no action at this time.

        ************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ***************
  
        You may wish to stop the HL7 filers prior to the install to
        prevent possible 'No Source Errors' from occurring. No
        transmissions will be lost if the filers are stopped first,
        they will be picked up once the filers are restarted.
