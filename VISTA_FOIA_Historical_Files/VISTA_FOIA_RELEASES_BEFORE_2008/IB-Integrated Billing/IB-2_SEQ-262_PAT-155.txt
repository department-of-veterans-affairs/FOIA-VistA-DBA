Subject: ELECTRONIC BILLING FOR MEDICARE REMITTANCE ADVICE (MRA)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Input Template
  - Other

Description:
============

 The MRA solution is an enhancement to Integrated Billing (IB) and 
 Accounts Receivable (AR) functionality for billing of secondary 
 carriers.  When a patient has health care insurance that is secondary to 
 Medicare, the VA has not been able to provide these secondary carriers a 
 statement of what Medicare paid as the VA has no authority to bill 
 Medicare in most instances.
  
 The purpose of the MRA project is to provide VA facilities the ability to 
 send claims to Medicare to produce a remittance advice (MRA) as though 
 Medicare had paid the claim.  VA will then furnish the MRA to insurers 
 that provide health insurance benefits secondary to Medicare with a 
 remittance notice delineating the Medicare allowable payment and the 
 amount for which a beneficiary is liable.  The secondary insurer will 
 then be able to accurately pay VA claims without the expense of 
 calculating the amount allowable under Medicare.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - IBY155NV

 This is the environment check routine.  This routine ensures that the EDI
 enhancements software has been installed previously and has not been
 backed out.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - IBY155PR

 This is the pre-install routine.  This routine deletes some fields that 
 will be updated during the install.  It also has the list of output 
 formatter data elements in the IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION (#364.5) file 
 which are included with this patch.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - IBY155PO

 This is the post-install routine.  This routine creates a new, non-human 
 user entry in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for the purposes of filing the
 MRA data and creating and authorizing the secondary claim.  It also adds
 some parameter defaults, non-billable reasons, new bill form type, and
 modifies some Medicare entries in the IB PROVIDER ID # TYPE (#355.97) 
 file.  The insurance company checker utility is also invoked during the
 post-install.
