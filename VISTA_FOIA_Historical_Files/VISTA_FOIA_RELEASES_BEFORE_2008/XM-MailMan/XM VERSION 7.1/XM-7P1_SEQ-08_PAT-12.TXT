        Save a copy of XMRPCTS0 routine either before you begin this
        installation or when requested to do so during the unloading
        of the specified PackMan message.  There are no differences
        in the installation on an ALPHA, or on a 486 platform.

2.  Load the PackMan message into your production account.
 
3.  Execute CHECK^XTSUMBLD to compute checksum for the following routine.
