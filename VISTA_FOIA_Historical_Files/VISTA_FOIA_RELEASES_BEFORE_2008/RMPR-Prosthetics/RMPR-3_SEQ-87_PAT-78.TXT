Description:
============

 This patch is the Prosthetics part of the Clinical Indicator Data Capture
 (CIDC) project.  There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated with this
 patch.
  
  
 Overview
 ========
 This patch provides for enhancing the Prosthetics package by adding
 Clinical Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) capability.  It includes updates to
 files 668 and 660.  For a prosthetic item to be deemed "ready for 
 billing", it must have come from CPRS/Consults, it has to be closed out
 and/or linked to suspense, and a shipment date has to be added.  The
 largest modifications were to the HL7 processing sections code, which are
 newly responsible to pick up and store data from the DG1 and ZCL segments.
 After data is received through the HL7 message, and is marked as ready for
 billing, Integrated Billing will be aware of the data and will pick it up
 during it's nightly run.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ======================
  
 Modifications to the package have been made to capture the diagnosis and
 Service-Connected/Environmental Indicator data passed from CPRS Consults.
 This data will then be extracted by the Integrated Billing package for
 third-party billing purposes.  An additional field 'Shipment Date' has 
 been added to signify when a Prosthetics transaction has been closed out
 and ready for Integrated Billing.
  
 Technical Description
 =====================
 Routine Added
 -------------
  
 Routine RMPR4E23 has been added to the application to handle the 
 entry/default of the Shipment Date during Reconcile/Close Out Purchase
 Card Transaction.
  
 Routines Modified
 -----------------
  
 1. Routines RMPRHL7A, RMPRHL7B, RMPRHL7U, and RMPRPCE1 have been changed 
 to receive HL7 DG1 and ZCL segments, parse into components, store in file
 #668 - Prosthetic Suspense and file #660 - Record of Pros 
 Appliance/Repair.
  
  
 2. Routines RMPR4E21 and RMPRE21 have been modified to check if there was
 a Transaction Date in file #440.6 - Purchase Card Order Reconcile. If yes,
 use the Transaction Date as the default date for the Shipment Date. If
 not, then use today's date as the default Shipment Date.
  
 3. Routine RMPRPCEA has been enhanced to change the existing data items,
 "Service connected", "Agent Orange", "Ionizing Radiation," "Environmental
 Contaminants", "Head/Neck Cancer", "Military Sexual Trauma", and "Combat
 Veteran Status"  to come from the new CIDC fields. If these fields exist,
 they are added to those that get sent to PCE (uses DBIA1889-A;
 $$DATA2PCE^PXAPI).  If the new CIDC fields do not exist, the routine will
 continue to function as before.
  
 4. Routines RMPR29T and RMPRSTE have been modified to use today's date as 
 the default Shipment Date/Date of Service.
