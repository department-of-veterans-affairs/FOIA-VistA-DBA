Subject: USER NOT GETTING PROMPTED TO COMPLETE A CONSULT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When attempting to complete a consult, the user is not receiving the prompt,
 "do you wish to complete a consult with a note"
      
 ASSOCIATED NOIS  
 ===============     
 LEB-0104-21849 - Remedy Ticket 67855 Cannot get prompted to complete a consult
      
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
      
 Problem  
 -------
 When setting users up in Set up Consult Services [GMRC SETUP
 REQUEST SERVICES] a user can be entered in any one of seven 
 areas that should allow them to complete a consult:
      
  UPDATE USERS W/O NOTIFICATIONS (#123.3) 
  ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USERS (#123.33)
  UPDATE TEAMS W/O NOTIFICATIONS (#123.31)
  ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE TEAMS (#123.34)
  UPDATE USER CLASSES W/O NOTIFS (#123.35)
  SERVICE INDIVIDUAL TO NOTIFY (#123.08)
  SERVICE TEAMS TO NOTIFY(#123.1)
      
  While Functional Independence Measurement is only evaluating:
  UPDATE USERS W/O NOTIFICATIONS (#123.3)
  ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USERS (#123.33)
  when validating for permission to complete a consult.
           
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RMIMV to utilize an API call to 
 VALID^GMRCAU (IA #4576). This is the call that is utilized in Consult/Record
 Tracking to validate permissions for consult completion.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
      
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.
      
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
      
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMIM*1.0*4)
      
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     RMIM*1.0*4.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
      
  8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
