Subject: CREATE AND POPULATE NCPDP NUMBER FIELD

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will create and populate a new NCPDP NUMBER field (#1008) in
 the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59). This field is needed for the Remote Data
 Interoperability Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical/Health Data 
 Repository (CHDR) application.
  
 NCPDP stands for the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs
 formerly referred to as the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy 
 Number (NABP). The numbers being used to populate the field come from a 
 spreadsheet provided for this project dated 2/11/05.
  
 The PSO SITE INPUT TEMPLATE is changed to include the new field. Through
 the PSO SITE PARAMETERS [Site Parameter Enter/Edit] option, the user can
 add, edit, or delete the NCPDP assigned licensed pharmacy number.
  
 When the patch is installed, a post-install job will be queued to 
 populate the NCPDP number and a MailMan message will be sent indicating 
 the NCPDP numbers for each active division and site. If there is already 
 a value in the NCPDP number field, this patch will not overwrite it. 
  
 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: All active outpatient sites must have an NCPDP number entered. An 
 outpatient site will need its own unique NCPDP number if it orders in its
 own stock and dispenses this stock as prescriptions to patients. Usually
 these sites also have their own DEA number.
  
 For active sites that do not have an NCPDP number filled in after the
 installation of this patch, using the PSO SITE PARAMETERS [Site Parameter
 Enter/Edit] option enter the number for each site. If the unique NCPDP
 number does not apply or is not assigned yet, enter the main site's NCPDP
 number.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites will retrieve VISTA documentation from the following FTP
  addresses.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
  available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation
  directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     anonymous.software

  released in a very short timeframe. A full technical manual will be
  released in patch PSO*7*213.

  Documentation Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed while Outpatient Pharmacy users are on the
 system. Installation will take no longer than 3 minutes. There are no
 scheduling restrictions or recommendations.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be

 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*216)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*216.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of

    respond NO.
  
 8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 10. For active sites that do not have an NCPDP number filled in after the
     installation of this patch, using the PSO SITE PARAMETERS [Site 
     Parameter Enter/Edit] option enter the number for each site. If the
     unique NCPDP number does not apply or is not assigned yet, enter the
     main site's NCPDP number.
