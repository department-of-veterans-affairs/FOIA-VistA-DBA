Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to redirect VISTA transmissions to the new
 Regional Counsel (RC) systems for processing, and to add new functionality
 to the existing VISTA RC system so our integrated sites have the ability
 to send messages to the correct Regional Counsel system. This was 
 requested by Randy Trexler and endorsed by the Office of General Counsel.
  
 The existing Regional Counsel Interface supports the electronic
 transmission of Reimbursable Insurance (RI) bills, follow-up file, and 
 payment information between a VAMC's VISTA system, and a Regional
 Counsel's system.
  
 At the time the original interface was developed, the RC systems were 
 M-based systems. Since that time, the original M-based systems have been
 re-hosted. The VISTA systems have continued to transmit Accounts
 Receivable (AR) information to VA MailMan servers on the old RC systems.
 The legacy RC systems have been forwarding this information to the new
 RC systems. This patch will make the changes required to transmit the
 VISTA AR data to the new RC systems. At the conclusion of this project,
 bi-directional messaging will exist between the VISTA systems and the new
 RC systems.
  
 This patch will also redirect the Death Notification transmissions to RC. 
 When patients who have bills in RC are discharged with a type of discharge 
 of 'Death' or 'Death with Autopsy', RC will be notified. These
 transmissions will be transmitted directly to the new RC systems for death
 notification.
  
 An environment check routine (RCY159EN) will run to make sure that the
 Remote Domain field is populated with an 'RC-' mail address for the
 primary division, and all divisions of care. If the Remote Domain is not
 populated, or it's set to an invalid RC address, the install will abort,
 and the site will need to enter the correct Remote Domain by using the
 option RC Parameters Edit [PRCA RC PARAMETERS].
  
 A post-init routine (RCY159PO) will look at the old RC addresses, and
 convert them to the new re-hosted mail addresses assigned to their
 division or division of care.
  
 New RC mail addresses will be similar to the following:
  
 For most RC transmissions:
 --------------------------
 From RC-BOSTON.GC.VA.GOV  to  OGCBOSRI@MAIL.VA.GOV 
  
 Death Notification addresses:
 -----------------------------
 From G.RC RC REFERRALS@RC-BOSTON.GC.VA.GOV to 
   OGCRegion1DeathNotification@mail.va.gov
  
   
 This patch introduces new functionality that will allow integrated sites
 that have multiple divisions of care, which are supported by multiple
 Regional Counsel offices, to electronically interface Third Party (TP)
 Reimbursable Health receivables. General Counsel's Regional Counsel (RC)
 organizational structure provides specific jurisdictional authority and
 staffing to allow RC offices to handle claims from specific Medical Center
 divisions. Once a site integrates into one database, claims are created
 on the integrated database for all divisions of care. This patch allows
 claims created under multiple divisions of care in the same database to
 electronically interface with their associated RC office. 
  
  
 All sites should install this patch.  However, sites may or may not have
 the need to implement the multi-divisional functionality. If TP
 Reimbursable Health Insurance claims created in the VISTA database are for
 multiple divisions of care, which are supported by different RC offices,
 then the multi-divisional functionality should be implemented. 
  
  
 To implement the RC multi-divisional functionality, the site's MCCR RC
 Coordinator should use the 'RC Parameters Edit' option to enter in the
 multiple divisions of care, and their corresponding RC Remote Domain.    
  
 See RC Parameter Example below:
 ------------------------------- 
  
 >D ^XUP
 Select OPTION NAME:    PRCA RC PARAMETERS     RC Parameters Edit
 RC Parameters Edit
 PURGE FREQUENCY: 90//

 RC MAIL ADDRESS: OGCPHIRI@MAIL.VA.GOV  Replace 
 RC DEATH NOTIFICATION ADDRESS: OGCRegion4DeathNotification@mail.va.gov
            Replace 
  
 Enter Division(s) of care if domain is different from the primary RC Mail 
 Address.

   RC DEATH NOTIFICATION ADDRESS: OGCRegion5DeathNotification@mail.va.gov
            Replace 
  
           
 The new functions of the AR Regional Counsel options are described as 
 follows.
                                     
  
 RC PARAMETERS EDIT  [PRCA RC PARAMETERS]:
 -----------------------------------------
 The value of the Purge Frequency should not be altered for the purpose of
 this patch. The Remote Domain will no longer be asked by this option after
 installation of the patch. The RC Mail Address, and RC Death Notification
 Address will now be asked for the primary division and the Divisions of 
 Care. The electronic RC interface will not work if these fields are not
 populated. These fields will be populated with the post-init of this patch. 
 Use this option to add additional Divisions of Care.
  
 To implement or turn on the multi-divisional RC functionality,
 division(s), who have a different RC Mail Address from the primary RC
 Mail Address, must be entered in the Division of Care sub-file with their
 associated RC Mail Address and associated RC Death Notification Address.  
 Divisions who share the same RC Mail Address as the primary RC Mail Address,
 if added as a division of care, will be deleted from the system.
 Note:  Not all sites will need to need to implement the Division
 of Care, if all sites will be sending RC transmissions to the
 same RC mail address.
  
  
 Review/Refer TP Bills to RC [PRCAC RC REVIEW/REFER]:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Only sites that implemented the RC multi-divisional functionality will
 notice a change in this option. This option will allow the users to review
 and refer TP bills to the appropriate RC offices. Changes to this
 functionality will occur during the selection of sort criteria. Users will
 be prompted to select a Medical Center Division to sort by. These
 divisions were entered in the RC Parameters. Bills with a Default Division
 as the one selected and meeting other sort criteria will be listed for
 review and possible referral. The Refer bills to RC action will send bills
 to the associated RC Mail Address for the selected division. If the bill's
 division of care is not determinable, the bill will be sent to the Primary
 RC Remote Domain. The domain (division of care) must be selected at the
 beginning of the option and will remain the recipient domain for all
 actions taken during the use of the option until the user selects QUIT and
 exits the option. A new domain may be selected by starting the option
 again and selecting a new domain (division of care). The selected domain
 (division of care) will remain as the recipient of all actions taken
 during the use of the option until the user again exits the option by
 selecting QUIT as the action.
  
  
 TP Referred Follow-up [PRCAC RC ACTION MENU]:
 ---------------------------------------------
 Only sites that implemented the RC multi-divisional functionality will
 notice a change in this option. This option allows users to electronically
 send follow-up requests for various actions to be taken on referred TP
 bills. Changes to this functionality will occur during the selection of
 sort criteria. Users will be prompted to select a Medical Center Division
 to sort by. These divisions were entered in the RC Parameters. Bills with
 a Default Division as the one selected and meeting other sort criteria
 will be listed for follow-up action. The Transmit AR Transaction, Request
 an Action and Increase TP Bill actions will send bills to the associated
 RC Mail Address for the selected division.
  
  
 Reconciliation Rollup Request for RC  [PRCAC RC RRR]:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 Only sites that implemented the RC multi-divisional functionality will
 notice a change in this option. The AR/RC electronic interface cannot work
 properly unless the Accounts Receivable and Regional Counsel databases
 remain in sync. This is ensured by monthly reconciliation reports. The
 sites may manually request a reconciliation report or wait for the monthly
 background run. Requests will be sent to all the RC domains listed in the
 RC Parameters.    
  
  
 Agent Cashier Menu  [RCDP AGENT CASHIER MENU]:
 ----------------------------------------------
 Only sites that implemented the RC multi-divisional functionality will
 notice a change in this option. Payments in full will be sent to the
 bill's Division of Care. If the division of care cannot be determined, the
 payment information will be sent to the Primary Division. 
  
  
 Account Profile  [RCDP ACCOUNT PROFILE]:
 ----------------------------------------
 The Account Profile's Bill Profile will display the Division of Care if
 defined for TP bills.  
  
  
 This patch also fixes an undefined error with the reconciliation report.
 Changes were made to routine RCRCREC to correct this error.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):            
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20031003 - AR/RC RI Interface - Change of E-mail Address
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 CPH-0804-40120       <UNDEFINED>MAINQ+1^RCRCREC
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 CPH-0804-40120       <UNDEFINED>MAINQ+1^RCRCREC
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site receives a $ZE= <UNDEFINED>MAINQ+1^RCRCREC error.
  
 The variables "RCXTYP,RCXMZ" at line MAINQ are killed in routine RCRCREC
 before attempting to kill a global that references the two variables.
 This caused the site to receive an undefined error when they ran the
 Reconciliation Report.                     
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This error is resolved in this patch.

        ************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
  
 Before installation of this patch, it is required that all sites check to
 make sure that REMOTE DOMAIN field (#32) is populated correctly in the AR
 TRANSMISSION  File (#349.1) with the Regional Counsel mail address for the
 primary division, and for those sites currently using the multi-divisional
 functionality, all their divisions of care. You will need to make sure 
 your primary division, and all divisions of care contain the correct
 Regional Counsel address starting with the preface 'RC-'. To do this,
 please use the option RC Parameters Edit [PRCA RC PARAMETERS]. Check to
 make sure that your Remote Domain field is populated with an address whose
 first three characters contain 'RC-'. Sites not currently using the
 multi-divisional functionality, will only need to update your primary
 division's remote domain. 
  
 It is imperative this Remote Domain field be populated correctly for
 all primary divisions, and divisions of care so that the environment check
 will allow the patch to load, and the post-init to update the sites with
 the latest Regional Counsel addresses.
  
 For for those sites NOT currently using the multi-divisional
 functionality, the RC PARAMETERS EDIT will display like the following:
  
 Select OPTION NAME: RC PARAMETERS EDIT  PRCA RC PARAMETERS 
 PURGE FREQUENCY: 90// 
 REMOTE DOMAIN: RC-NASHVILLE.GC.VA.GOV//
  
  
 For for those sites currently using the multi-divisional functionality,
 the RC PARAMETERS EDIT will display like the following:
