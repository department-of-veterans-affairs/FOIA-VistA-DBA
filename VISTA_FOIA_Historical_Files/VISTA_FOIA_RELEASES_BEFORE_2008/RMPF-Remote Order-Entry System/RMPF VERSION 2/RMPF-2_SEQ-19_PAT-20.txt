Subject: EXPIRATION OF CHA CONTRACT TRANSITION PERIOD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is for adding the necessary changes to inactivate
 models on the expired contract.  The following changes are included.
  
      1.  Inactivate models from the expired contract.  This is done
 	 by setting a flag in the REMOTE PRODUCT INVENTORY File.
 	 The field, "Inactive", will be set to inactive.  Setting
 	 this flag will make the model unavailable for selection while
 	 in the ROES system.  The components for these models will
 	 also be removed.
  
      2.  The Adjustment option for models purchased under the expired
 	 contract will be disabled.
  
      3.  When doing a model change, you will no longer be able
 	 to add components.
  
      4.  The following warning will NOT display when a remote is the
 	 third device in a custom hearing aid order.
  
 	 "Two or more aids are ordered for the same ear."
 
  	 This warning will only be displayed when there are more than
 	 two aids for the same ear (ie. left or right).
  
      5.  A Correction has been made to allow adjustments within
          the 180 day trial period.
