 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1. HD0000000055498: POR-0304-52029: Editing date value in ECS GUI & Vol
                     resets to one (1)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing a date on a record within Event Capture GUI the Volume gets 
 reset to value of 1. This does not happen in Roll-n-scroll, which retains 
 the Volume previously entered.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Event Capture GUI source code was modified to prevent the Volume field
 from being reset to 1 once the Procedure Date/Time field has been updated.
  
 2. HD0000000089287: Error in Event Capture
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the user goes to the entry screen, doesn't notice date/time is blank
 and tries to enter a procedure, a dialogue box appears that says the 
 Date/time must be entered. They click OK and a date/time shows up in the 
 date/time field. The user assumes that the "now" date/time is entered and 
 completes the rest of the fields. When they click the final button to 
 file the information, they get a dialogue box that states "EC data missing
 ECPTSTAT". If they then click on the date/time box and enter a date/time
 or click "now", the date/time entry "takes" and they can now file the
 entry.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The defaulted date/time was removed from the Procedure Date/Time field, 
 if the user receives the dialogue box that says the Date/time must be
 entered.
  
  
 3. HD0000000093911:  Provider Required error using ECS GUI edit option
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User gets an error when updating information using the EC GUI option Data Entry
 by Patient. If a user notices they have entered data that is wrong on a patient
 and tries to edit it they get an error no matter what data field they
 are updating. After making the change they click okay and it shows 
 the error message- "Changes were not saved for the following reason - The
 Primary Provider is Required" even though the Provider field shows the 
 provider. The only way to make the changes to the encounter is to Exclude
 the provider and then Include them again.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Event Capture GUI source code was modified to prevent the error message 
 "The Primary Provider is Required" from displaying incorrectly.
