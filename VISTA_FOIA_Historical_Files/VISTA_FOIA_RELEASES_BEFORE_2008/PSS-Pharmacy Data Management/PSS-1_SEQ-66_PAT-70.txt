Description: 
============

 1. This patch fixes the problem reported in NOIS HON-0403-60272 to 
    prevent the undefined variable error that occurs whenever DRUG file
    (#50) get updated and HL7 outgoing drug message is sent out.
  
 2. This patch deletes the Pharmacy quick order correction for CPRS 
    [PSS QUICK1] option, as it is an obsolete option. NOIS SBY-0403-30493
  
 3. This patch modifies the SYNONYM field (#.01) in the DRUG file (#50) to
    allow data entry using the new Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) bar
    codes contains the National Drug Code (NDC) number in a new format
    called "Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)". The GTIN has a 14-digit data
    structure, which is used within the Uniform Code Council/European
    Article Numbering (UCC/EAN) system for unique identification of
    trade items worldwide. This will allow BCMA GUI to correctly read the
    GTIN and search the synonym field for a matching NDC number.
