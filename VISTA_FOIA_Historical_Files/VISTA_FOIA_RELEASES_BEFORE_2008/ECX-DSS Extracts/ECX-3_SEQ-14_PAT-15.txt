Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
    
   Patch ECX*3*15 corrects a number of problems in the Prosthetics (PRO)
   extract which were discovered at the Long Beach facility, including
   NOIS LON-1298-60860.
    
   An updated data dictionary for the PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826)
   is being distributed to correct the field length for several fields, as
   well as the file cross references.
    
   The ECXPRO* routines have been revised in order to:
   
   (1) Comply with the updated data dictionary.
   (2) Generate TWO extract records in the case where the Receiving Station
       and the Requesting Station are the same for a Prosthetics Lab
       transaction.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*15):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*15.
    
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       ECXPRO     Prosthetics Extract 
       ECXTRANS   Transmit Data from Extract Files
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
