  ENHANCEMENTS
  ============
 
     Modifier Pairs
 
         The annual 2004 update to modifiers that may be used with CPT 
         (Current Procedural Terminology) and HCPCS (Healthcare Common 
         Procedure Coding System) codes are provided with this patch. 
         These modifier pairings are supplied by Ingenix (the designated
         authoritative source for modifier pairs) and provide the only 
         valid pairs (i.e., linked codes and modifiers) that may be used
         to encode special circumstances which adjust or modify codes.
 
  NOIS/Defects
  ============
 
     AUG-0204-32253 and ASH-0204-31578
 
         The DISTRIBUTION DATE (#.02) field in the CPT COPYRIGHT FILE
         (#81.2) was not updated to reflect reflect the latest version
         of CPT/HCPCS codes.  This resulted in the reports from the ICPT 
         OUTPUT MENU to return incorrect data.  With patch LEX*2.0*29, the
         DISTRIBUTION DATE (#.02) field in the CPT COPYRIGHT FILE (#81.2)
         will be updated to correctly reflect Jan 1, 2004.  DBIA #4491
         provides authority for the Lexicon Utility to write the changes
         to this file.
 
         Example: 
 
             Global Node before LEX*2.0*29 instalation (note piece 2):
 
                  ^DIC(81.2,1,0) = CPT MESSAGE^3030101
 
             Global Node AFTER LEX*2.0*29 installation (note piece 2):
 
                  ^DIC(81.2,1,0) = CPT MESSAGE^3040101
 
     CIN-0404-40409
 
         CPT code 88112 had the wrong description in the CPT FILE (#81).
         DBIA #4489 provides the authority for the Lexicon Utility to 
         write the changes to file #81.  This has been replaced with 
         "CYTOPATHOLOGY, SELECTIVE CELLULAR ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUE WITH 
         INTERPRETATION (EG, LIQUID BASED SLIDE PREPARATION METHOD), 
         EXCEPT CERVICAL OR VAGINAL."  A similar fix was made to the
         Lexicon.

         patch LEX*2.0*29:
