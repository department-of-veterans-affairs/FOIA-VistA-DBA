Description:
============

 This patch provides a new note title and associated objects for the 
 "Transitional Pharmacy Benefit" Program.
  
 Please read the entire patch description before beginning the installation 
 of this patch.  Do not queue the installation of this patch!
  
 This patch contains one new TIU routine.
  
 The user installing the patch must enter the existing DOCUMENT CLASS under
 which the new note title will be added.  If the new TITLE is to be placed
 into a new DOCUMENT CLASS, it must be created BEFORE the installation
 process has begun.  This must be answered during installation so DO NOT
 QUEUE this patch for a later installation.  Installation of this patch
 will be less than 5 minutes.
  
 **** If you are unsure of the DOCUMENT CLASS, please contact a ****
 **** Clinical Applications Coordinator before installation.    ****
  
 The TIU document titled TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT NOTE will inherit 
 the characteristics of the document class where it is placed.  To control 
 the actions of the note title to ensure the user is asked to enter the 
 encounter information as needed, it is recommended the note title be set 
 up individually using the following options:
  
 TIU Maintenance Menu
  
    1      Basic TIU Parameters
    2      Modify Upload Parameters
    3      Document Parameter Edit

 The parameters indicated by the arrows above must be set as shown.  The

 The user may abort the installation by entering a '^' at the DOCUMENT CLASS 
 prompt; this will NOT install any of the items and allow the KIDS 
 installation to be re-started at a later time.
  
 The following entries will be added automatically:
 Name                                      Type

 TIU TPBN PCP                              TIU Object
  
 An error message will be returned if any of the needed entries are not 
 successfully installed and the installation of the objects and title will 
 not continue.

 Installation Instructions: 
 =========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.
 Installation of this patch should take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following
     options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*170):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global 
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*170.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES, and DISABLE the TIU* Options and
     Protocols.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//', respond '0'.
  
 8.  At the prompt, 'Select the DOCUMENT CLASS where the new title will be
     installed:  ', enter the location where the new note title will be 
     added.  A DOCUMENT CLASS must be selected at this time or enter '^'
     to abort.
  
     If there are no name conflicts, installation should complete 
     automatically.
  
     The following error messages and actions are listed below:
     Message:  "Can't find Health Summary Object."
       Cause:  The health summary object and type cannot be found.  Verify
               the entries in HEALTH SUMMARY OBJECTS (#142.5) and HEALTH
               SUMMARY TYPE (#142) and/or remove the entries. 
               (They should be installed automatically during
               the patch installation.  Verify that no error message was
               received for their installation.)
  
     Message:  "Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Note already exists."
       Cause:  The note title already exists.  The install will not continue
               until this title is removed.  Manually execute EN^TIUTPBN 
               from the programmer's prompt once the title has been removed.
  
     Message:  "Class owner cannot be defined."
       Cause:  The CLINICAL COORDINATOR class cannot be found.  Verify the 
               entry in the USR CLASS (#8930) file.  Manually execute
               EN^TIUTPBN from the programmer's prompt to re-try the 
               installation.
  
     Message:  "TIU Object name already exists."
               "TIU Object creation failed."
       Cause:  Verify that the object NAME does not exist in TIU DOCUMENT 
               DEFINITION (#8925.1).  All pre-existing entries must be
               removed before manually re-starting.
  
     Using the Document Definitions (Manager) from the TIU MAINTENANCE MENU,
     test the boilerplate text of the TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT NOTE and
     activate the note title (this may need to be done by your Clinical 
     Applications Coordinator).
  
     The new note title should now be ready for use.
