Subject: TOO MANY RECORDS IN FILE #45.7 FOR TRT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
   This patch corrects a problem in the Treating Specialty Change 
   (TRT) extract which was reported in NOIS issue HIN-1298-42705.
    
   The TRT extract routine (ECXTRT) sets a variable, TEMP, which is 
   derived from the records in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY file
   (#45.7).  After installation of patch DG*5.3*176, a few sites
   experienced a problem with the TRT extract.  It seems that new
   records added to file #45.7 by patch DG*5.3*176 were added at
   large internal record numbers (i.e., iens of 900 or above).  This
   then caused a string-length error to occur in ECXTRT when setting
   variable TEMP.
   
   ECXTRT has been revised to store the needed treating specialty
   data in a temporary global array.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*17):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*17.
    
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       ECXTRT     Treating Specialty Change Extract
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
