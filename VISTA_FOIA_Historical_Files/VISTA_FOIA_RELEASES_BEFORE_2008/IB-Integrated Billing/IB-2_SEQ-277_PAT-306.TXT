Subject: STOP CODE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to update VistA DSS Stop Codes for outpatient
 copay in the IB CLINIC STOP CODE BILLABLE TYPES file (#352.5), with 
 an effective date of May 2, 2005. The required copay for the smoking 
 cessation counseling (individual and group) codes will be changed to
 non-billable. 
  
 The patch will update the Billable Type field (#.03) of the IB CLINIC 
 STOP CODE BILLABLE TYPES file (#352.5) for the following stop codes in the
 file.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000093441 Change in DSS Stop Code
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Chief Business Office has requested that the type of billing for 
    the SMOKING CESSATION codes be changed from  basic care ($15) to
    non-copay ($0). This requires a change in the IB CLINIC STOP CODE
    BILLABLE TYPE file (#352.5).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The patch will not change the existing functionality of the IB package.
    The post-init routine IB20P306 will update the stop codes with a new
    billable type and a new effective date.
