Subject: REMOVAL OF AMPIZZ AND ATSSN CROSS-REFERENCES - MPI CHANGES ITERATION 2

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  This patch is in support of the Master Patient Index/Patient
  Demographics (MPI/PD) Changes Iteration 2 project.
   
  DG*5.3*361 and DG*5.3*440 are required builds for patch DG*5.3*589.
   
  Issue 1: The purpose of the post-installation routine, DG53589P,
  is to remove two cross-references.  DG53589P will remove the "AMPIZZ"
  cross-reference on the NAME (#.01) field and the "ATSSN" cross-reference
  on the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  It will also re-compile the associated templates.
   
  NOTE: DG*5.3*589 functionality does not affect any existing Registration
  functionality other than this MPI/PD functionality.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
  be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
  1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
  
  2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state.
    
  3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will not have to
      disable mapping.
   
  4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.]
  
  5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
      select the Installation menu.
  
  6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*589).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
  7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*589.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', respond No.
   
  9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond No.
    
  10. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 3, return them to the
      mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
  11. Routine DG53589P will be automatically deleted from your system
      after successful installation of the patch.
