  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch addresses problems in the Registration package. It enables the 
 users to print the Inpatient Roster for providers who have left a facility.
 It clarifies the dates of eligibility for Spanish American War veterans.  
 It allows users to enter more than 3 surgeries for the same date.  And, it
 prevents the entry of an insurance claim number which is too long when a
 pseudo-SSN is used.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1. BOS-1098-12331  DIC('S') SCREEN USES DELETED FIELD
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The DG INPATIENT ROSTER option calls the DGOINPT routine. This routine
 does not allow the user to print providers with the "I" node set in the
 ^VA(200 global.  This causes a problem when providers leave the facility
 and later return.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The screen (below) has been removed from PROV+6^DGOINPT
  
 DIC("S")="S DGTM=$G(^(""I""))I DGTM'>0!(DGTM>DT)"
  
  
 2. MIW-1102-40535 Brief Description for Spanish American Period of Service
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Brief Description field (#21) for the Spanish American War entry in 
 the Period of Service file (#21) may be misleading due the use of two-digit 
 year values:  (4/21/98-7/4/02). This could be interpreted as 
 4/21/1998 - 7/4/2002.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Brief Description has been changed to: (4/21/1898-7/4/1902)
  
  
 3. ANN-1202-40157  PTF CODING PROBLEM
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Ann Arbor reported a problem with PTF when complying with the following 
 rule during coding of surgical episodes:
  
 "Per Coding Clinic, Second Quarter 1995, page 10 "to code 03.09, Other 
 Exploration and decompression of the spinal canal, it is to be reported 
 twice, when a decompression microlaminoplasty is carried out at L3-4 
 and L4-5 during the same surgical episode." 
  
 Performing 03.09 twice requires 4 separate surgical episodes to be entered 
 (Load/Edit PTF Data Option).  PTF will not allow the record to be closed
 with more than 3 surgeries on the same day for a given patient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 ^DGPTFTR0 and ^DGPTR0 have been modified to display the message as a 
 warning only, allowing the user to decide whether or not to proceed (see 
 below).
  
 Performing edit checks...
 **There are more than three surgeries on the same date**
 OK to continue?? YES// ....
 ****** PTF CLOSED OUT ******
  
 Note:  If the user answers NO at the prompt, the software will behave as 
 before (i.e. the record will not close out).
  
  
 4. ISB-0103-31564  Psuedo SSN used for Claim Number
  
 Problem:
 --------
 MPI Data Quality Management reported a problem with sites transmitting
 pseudo SSNs as Claim Numbers for Eligibility.  MPI considers a pseudo 
 SSN to be an invalid Claim Number and rejects Claim Numbers greater 
 than 9 characters.  The current work around is to have sites change the
 Claim Number (screen 7, Load/Edit Patient Data option) to something 
 other than the pseudo SSN and retransmit.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The input transform for the CLAIM NUMBER field (#.313) of the PATIENT file 
 (#2) currently allows pseudo SSNs to be entered.  The input transform has 
 been modified to disallow SSN's greater than 9 characters when entering 
 "SS" for the CLAIM NUMBER, or when typing a patient's pseudo SSN directly
 into the field.  The help text for this field has been updated to reflect
 this change.  
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
  
 1. A change was made to the BRIEF DESCRIPTION (field #20) of the SPANISH 
 AMERICAN entry in the PERIOD OF SERVICE file (#21). 
  
 Before:
 -------
 (4/21/98-7/4/02)
  
 After:
 ------
 (4/21/1898-7/4/1902)
  
  
 2. The input transform of the CLAIM NUMBER field (#.313) of the PATIENT 
 file (#2) was changed as follows:
  
 Before:
 -------
 S DFN=DA D EV^DGLOCK I $D(X) S L=$S($D(^DPT(DA,0)):$P(^(0),U,9),1:X) 
 W:X?1"SS".E "  ",L S:X?1"SS".E X=L I X'=L K:$L(X)>8!($L(X)<7)!'(X?.N) X
  
 After:
 ------ 
 S DFN=DA D EV^DGLOCK I $D(X) S L=$S($D(^DPT(DA,0)):$P(^(0),U,9),1:X)
 W:X?1"SS".E "  ",L S:X?1"SS".E X=L K:$L(X)>9 X Q:'$D(X)  I X'=L K:$L
 (X)>8!($L(X)<7)!'(X?.N) X
  
  
 3. The Help Prompt text of the CLAIM NUMBER field (#.313) of the PATIENT 
 file (#2) was changed as follows:
  
 Before:
 -------
 HELP-PROMPT:      Enter this patient's claim number as 7-8 
                   numerics or enter SS if the claim number is the
                   same as his/her SSN. 
  
 After:
 ------
 HELP-PROMPT:      Enter this patient's claim number as 7-8 
                   numerics or enter SS if the claim number is the 
                   same as his/her SSN.  Pseudo SSNs are not 
                   allowed. 
  
 TEMPLATES:
 ==========
  
 The following compiled PATIENT file (#2) Input Templates will be recompiled
 during the installation process to incorporate changes made to the input
 transform of the CLAIM NUMBER field (#.313):

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the
 impact on users of the Registration package.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE  
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
     at this time.

     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*524):
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
    
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*524.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.

 POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
  
 1. Recompile any local* compiled Input Templates on the PATIENT file (#2)
 that include the CLAIM NUMBER field (#.313).  
  
 * The supported Input Templates DG LOAD EDIT SCREEN 7 and DVBHINQ UPDATE 
 will be recompiled during installation and do not need to be recompiled 
 manually.
  
 2. Post-install routine, DG53P524, may be deleted after installation.
