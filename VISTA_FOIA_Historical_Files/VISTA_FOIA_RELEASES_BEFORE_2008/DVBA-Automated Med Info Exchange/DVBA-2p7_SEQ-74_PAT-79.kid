 ;;POWs.  Approach these veterans with the greatest sensitivity because the 
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",9,0)
 ;;POW experience likely resulted in a great deal of psychological and physical

 ;;trauma.  Details about beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, 
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",11,0)
 ;;disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, and anxiety may be 
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",12,0)
 ;;significant parts of the veteran's history; eliciting these details requires  
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",13,0)
 ;;that one establish a trusting relationship with the veteran. Examine
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",14,0)
 ;;veteran for each disability / disease / condition veteran is claiming 
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",15,0)
 ;;as a consequence of the POW experience.  A former POW may be entitled 
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",16,0)
 ;;to service connection for presumptive POW diseases; the worksheet contains
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",17,0)
 ;;a list of these presumptive diseases.  Based on veteran's claim(s) and your
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",18,0)
 ;;findings, please refer to and follow additional worksheets to assure
"RTN","DVBCWPA1",19,0)
 ;;the examination  provides information adequate for rating purposes.
