Description: 
============

 The primary purpose of this patch is to provide an updated ASISTS OWCP 
 CHARGEBACK CODES File (#2263.6). In addition to this update,
 the following NOIS will be addressed:
 
 NOIS:
 -----
 BHS-0701-10746     CA1/2 Electronic Xmit option left unlocked
 NIN-0701-40870     Charge back code needs to be entered
 ANC-0701-51425     VERIFICATION OF TRANSMISSIONS
 
 The OOPS DOL XMIT DATA security key has been entered as a LOCK in the 
 Manual Transmission of DOL Data [OOPS DOL MANUAL XMIT DATA] menu option.  
 This does not change the functionality of the menu option, as this security 
 key was required prior to this patch.  Users needing to access this option 
 should have had the security key assigned previously.  The LOCK was not 
 entered for the Scheduled Transmission of DOL Data [OOPS DOL SCHEDULED XMIT 
 DATA] as this menu option should not appear on any menu.  NOIS: 
 BHS-0701-10746
 
 The Manual Transmit of National Database (2162) Data [OOPS MANUAL 2162 DATA 
 XMIT] menu option has been modified to transmit the Station Number from the 
 Institution file (#4), field 99 rather than the pointer to the Institution 
 file.   The same modification was made in the Manual Transmission of DOL 
 Data [OOPS DOL MANUAL XMIT DATA].  The functionality of these options has 
 not changed so users will not notice any differences unless the mailman 
 messages are reviewed.  NOIS: ANC-0701-51425
 
 OOPSNDB,OOPSNDBX and OOPSDOL routines have been modified to fix an error 
 related to the site location which is sent with the record to the National
 Data Base. 
 
 The ASISTS OWCP CHARGEBACK CODES File (#2263.6) has been updated to include 
 missing Chargeback codes.  Currently, only the 4 digit codes can be used. 
 The TAG is reviewing the issue of further defining a facility by allowing 
 use of a 2-character suffix appended to the 4 digit Chargeback code.  At 
 this time facilities should continue to use the 4 digit code.  
 NOIS: NIN-0701-40870.
 
 Routine OOPSUTL1 has been modified to fix a code bug in the CLRES
 subroutine. The change does not alter the functionality of the routine.
 
 INSTALLATION
 ------------
