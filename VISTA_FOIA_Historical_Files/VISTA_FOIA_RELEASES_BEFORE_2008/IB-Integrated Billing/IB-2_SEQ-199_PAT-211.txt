 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) FGH-0103-31212     CSA REJECTS/LAB BILLING
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the course of reviewing this NOIS, it was discovered that when using
    the View/Print EDI Bill Extract Data [IBCE EDI VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT] option
    from the EDI Transmission Status Reports [IBCE TXMT MGMNT REPORTS] Menu,
    the view displays under 'Type' the BILL CHARGE TYPE (#.27) field from the
    BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file instead of the FORM TYPE (#.19) field.
  
    It was also noted that when updating the Bill Charge Type using
    FileMan an undefined error occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCEXTRP has been modified to display the Form Type (#.19) and 
    function $$FT^IBCU3 has been modified to refer to variable IFN instead of
    IBIFN. 
  
 2) FGH-0402-33237     EN+6^IBCERP4:1 null subscript     
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the EDI Messages Not Yet Filed [IBCE MSGS PENDING TOO LONG] 
    option from the EDI Transmission Status Reports [IBCE TXMT MGMNT REPORTS]
    Menu, and creating the report, certain records in the EDI MESSAGES
    (#364.2) file have no zero node, thus causing a null subscript error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    While we have not been able to determine what causes these incomplete 
    records, without a zero node they no longer serve any purpose. 
    Therefore, routine ^IBCERP4 has been modified to kill the balance of 
    these incomplete records as they are encountered, thus preventing the
    null subscript error from occurring.
  
 3) LIT-1102-71613     EDI RETURN MESSAGE ROUTER ERROR
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Occasionally an internal entry number (IEN) for a batch is  
    skipped which prevents the new transmissions from creating a
    new batch number.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCE837A has been modified to do a 4-slash stuff of the Batch  
    Number (#.02) field of the EDI TRANSMIT BILL file (#364).
  
 4) OTH-0902-N1765     Bug in Copy and Cancel option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the Copy and Cancel [IB COPY AND CANCEL] option in the 
    Third Party Billing Menu [IB THIRD PARTY BILLING MENU] is used,
    the bill is copied and the FORM TYPE (#.19) field should not change.
    Because the Form Type is triggered by other fields when the 
    record is reindexed, there is the possibility that the Form 
    Type will change.  This is also the case when using the 
    Copy for Secondary/Tertiary Bill [IB COPY SECOND/THIRD] option
    and other options that update the payer sequence on the bill.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCCC2 has been modified to save the value of the
    Form Type before reindexing the record and to restore that 
    value if reindexing caused the value to change (except when
    a copy of the Institutional to Professional bill is initiated).
     
 5) LOU-0303-41307     [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] not Screening
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] 
    option is used, and a restricted record patient name is entered, the 
    user will be displayed the restricted record warning message.  If the
    user responds "No" to this message, indicating they do not wish to
    continue accessing the record, processing continues and the patient's
    record is displayed anyway.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBJTU2 has been modified not to access the record in those 
    circumstances.
  
 6) MAC-0203-61951     Edit of the 'Subscriber Name' for insurance not 
                       working
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Patient Insurance Info View/Edit [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
    option, and chunking down through the Subscriber Update [IBCNSP 
    SUBSCRIBER UPDATE] protocol, within the Policy Edit/View [IBCNSM VIEW PAT
    POLICY] protocol, the user is unable to edit the NAME OF INSURED field.
    This occurs when the patient has a Tricare sponsor, a Champus plan, and
    the policyholder is not the patient (i.e. WHOSE INSURANCE (#6) field in
    the INSURANCE TYPE SUB-FIELD (#2.312) file for the plan is either the
    Spouse or Other but not the veteran).   
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCNSU41 has been modified to allow editing the name.
    We should add that the sponsor's name should also be edited in 
    the SPONSOR PERSON (#355.82) file so there will be no contradictions.
  
 7) FGH-0203-30466     ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When adding a new Insurance Group Plan while using the Patient Insurance
    Info View/Edit [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE] option and selecting the Add
    Policy [IBCNSM ADD POLICY] protocol, the user is not prompted for the
    ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE (field #.15) of the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3)
    file.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCNSM3 has been modified to present this field and if
    Medicare is chosen, the PLAN CATEGORY (.#14) field will also be
    presented.
  
 8) MAR-1102-20168     Insurance Buffer Processing Hangs
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Process Insurance Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS]
    option and adding a new patient policy, the program will hang if the
    patient record is already locked by another option, such as the Load/Edit
    Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] option in Registration.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCNBMN has been modified to lock the patient record at
    the point where a new policy is about to be added.  If the record
    is already locked, the usual message to that effect will be
    displayed and the user will be able to continue processing.
  
 9)  STC-0402-42602     Rpt Claims Ready for Extract
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When printing a report longer than one page using the Ready for
    Extract Status Report [IBCE READY FOR EXTRACT REP] option from
    the EDI Transmission Status Reports [IBCE TXMT MGMNT REPORTS] menu,
    the pages after the first page contain the heading information and only
    one entry per page.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^IBCERP6 has been modified to print the report properly.
