 Highlights of the patch:
 - Addresses 54 distinct NOISs and 40 distinct E3Rs.
 - For those sites requesting it, performs, along with follow-on patch
   XM*7.1*51, automatic domain name change from .VA.GOV to .MED.VA.GOV, as
   well as domain rename. This patch adds the new domain names as synonyms to
   the current domain names.  XM*7.1*51 will actually change the domain names.
   (XM*7.1*51 will be released after all sites have installed XM*7.1*50.)
 - Adds many new APIs.
 - Replaces the old user help frames with an entire new set of help frames.
   (The IRM help frames have not been updated.)
 - Makes many changes to the MailMan DDs.
 - Renames file 3.7 from MAIL BOX to MAILBOX.
 - Renames file 4.3 from KERNEL SITE PARAMETERS to MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS.
 - Improves global integrity checker.
 - Improves message search.
 - Insists that users must have a mailbox and an access code in order to
   receive messages.  This is to ensure that messages do not accumulate in
   inactive mailboxes, never to be deleted.  It is very important that any
   fictitious user be properly set up so that mail deliveries to these
   users are not stopped.
 - Implements message filtering.
 - Improves local message delivery system.
 - Adds 'full screen' user interface for managing and reading messages.
 - Rewrites 'Classic' user interface to improve maintainability.
 - Most ^XMA* routines have been superseded by other routines.
 - (new) ^XMJ* routines comprise the user interface.
 - (new) ^XMK* routines perform message posting.
 - (new) ^XMT* routines perform message delivery.
 - (new) ^XMX* routines comprise the APIs.
 - (new) ^XMV* routines comprise user identity.
 - ^XMR* has been rewritten.
 - Improves the remote message xref, ^XMBX(3.9,"AI", by enabling it to handle
 longer message IDs.  Specifically, the xref has changed
 from: ^XMBX(3.9,"AI",site@msgid,xmz)=fm date/time
 to:   ^XMBX(3.9,"AI",site,msgid,xmz)=fm date 
 The post-init will reconfigure the xref.  (This could take anywhere from 1/2
 hour to several hours, depending on how large the global is.)  Here's a tip:
 You can cut down the time that this will take by running option
 XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
 prior to installing this patch.  This will reduce the number of xrefs in the
 AI xref global.
 - Enables message number recycling.  To do this,
 --A new field (17.1, MAX DIGITS FOR MESSAGE NUMBER) has been added to file
 4.3, to let each site decide how large the numbers may get before they
 recycle and start again (from 100000).  The post-init will set it to
 the maximum length of your site's existing message numbers.  (If it's less
 than 7, it will be set to 7.  If it's greater than 14, it will be set to 14.)
 You may change it afterward.
 --A new field (31, LOCAL CREATE DATE) has been added to file 3.9.  The post-
 init will go through the file 3.9, populate the new field with the date
 the message was sent, and create the new "C" xref.  (This will take about
 1 hour per 200,000 messages.)  Here's a tip:
 You can cut down the time that this will take by running option
 XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
 and XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
 prior to installing this patch.  This will reduce the number of messages
 in file 3.9.
 --The message purge processes have been changed to operate off LOCAL
 CREATE DATE.  The date purge routine is now much faster, since it has an
 appropriate xref to work with.  The weekday Unreferenced Messages Purge
 can focus better and thus be more efficient.
 --Other fields have changed their focus from message number to the LOCAL
 CREATE DATE:
 File 3.7, MAILBOX:
 3.7,1.2   MESSAGE @ REINSTATEMENT becomes DATE @ REINSTATEMENT (The post-
 init will change any existing message numbers in this field to their equiv-
 alent dates.
 File 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS:
 4.3,4.301 NO-PURGE MESSAGES
 BUFFER becomes NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (The post-
 init will set this field to null, which defaults to 2 days.  You may change
 it afterward.
 4.302,3   FIRST MESSAGE TO PROCESS  becomes START PURGE DATE
 4.302,4   LAST MESSAGE TO PROCESS   becomes STOP PURGE DATE
 4.302,8   LAST MESSAGE PROCESSED    becomes LAST DATE PROCESSED
 4.3,4.304 WEEKDAY MESSAGES TO PURGE becomes WEEKDAY DAYS TO PURGE (Any value
 your site has in this field will be changed by the post-init from number of
 messages to the equivalent number of days.  You may change it afterward.)
 4.3,142   NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER      becomes NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL)
  
 NOTES:
 a. This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  It should not be queued, because TaskMan should not be running.
 b. This patch requires Kernel patches XU*8.0*67, XU*8.0*112, and 
 XU*8.0*113.
 c. For any site running MAS (all VAMCs), this patch requires FileMan patch
 DI*22.0*1.  Caution: KIDS will not check for this patch because not all
 sites run MAS.  It is up to each site running MAS to check for DI*22.0*1.
 d. All MailMan users, including fictitious users, must have an access code,
 or they will no longer receive mail.
 e. To shorten installation time, which runs about 1 hour per 200,000 messages
 in file 3.9, you might consider running the message purges the day before
 the installation:
 - XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
 - XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
 - XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
 f. DSM sites running SlotMaster may see routine mapping problems with ZSLOT
 users, even after disabling mapping.  Therefore, such sites should consider
 the following steps:
 - Shut down ZSLOT on all nodes.
 - Disable all mapped XM routines.
 - Load this patch.
 - Enter manual edits.
 - Rebuild mapped routine sets.
 - Shut down/restart all DSM configurations.
 An alternative to the above steps is to disable all mapped XM routines about
 a week before you load this patch.  That way you wouldn't need to shut
 down ZSLOT or shut down/restart DSM configurations.
 g. If your site is running POP3, you should immediately load patch XM*7.1*71
 after installing this patch.

 INSTALLATION:
  
 NOTES:
 a. This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  It should not be queued, because TaskMan should not be running.
 b. This patch requires Kernel patches XU*8.0*67, XU*8.0*112, and XU*8.0*113.
 c. For any site running MAS (all VAMCs), this patch requires FileMan patch
 DI*22.0*1.  Caution: KIDS will not check for this patch because not all
 sites run MAS.  It is up to each site running MAS to check for DI*22.0*1.
 d. All MailMan users, including fictitious users, must have an access code
 or they will no longer receive mail.
 e. To shorten installation time, which runs about 1 hour per 200,000 messages
 in file 3.9, you might consider running the message purges the day before
 the installation:
 - XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
 - XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
 - XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
 f. DSM sites running SlotMaster may see routine mapping problems with ZSLOT
 users, even after disabling mapping.  Therefore, such sites should consider
 the following steps:
 - Shut down ZSLOT on all nodes.
 - Disable all mapped XM routines.
 - Load this patch.
 - Enter manual edits.
 - Rebuild mapped routine sets.
 - Shut down/restart all DSM configurations.
 An alternative to the above steps is to disable all mapped XM routines about
 a week before you load this patch.  That way you wouldn't need to shutdown
 ZSLOT or shut down/restart DSM configurations.
 g. If your site is running POP3, you should load patch XM*7.1*71
 immediately after installing this patch.
  
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 1. This patch replaces routine ^XMRPCTS1, which contains your site's TWIX
    routing info.  Before you install this patch, copy the current TWIX info
    from that routine at your site.  After you install this patch, edit
    the new ^XMRPCTS1 to set your site's current TWIX info.  Specifically:
 XMRPCTS1     ;(KC-VAMC)/XXX-Simple PCTS front end to MailMan ;03/19/98  
 11:10
      ;;7.1;MailMan;**6,50**;Jun 02, 1994
      N XMUS,XMFM,XMSTR,XMRI,XMTO,XMABORT
      ;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
      ;All should be sent to XXX@VHA.DMIA the local PCTS Domain
      ;Edit these for your site.               <---Copy your site's TWIX info
      S XMUS="XXXX" ;Local routing indicator   <---from this line
      S XMFM="YYYY" ;from line                 <---and this line
      I XMUS="XXXX"!(XMFM="YYYY") S %="FIX Routing codes !!!"_XMPCTS0("ERR")
      ;-------------------------------------------------------------
 2.  The TIME ZONE field in file 4.3 must have your site's time zone in it.
     Please check and ensure that it is there.
 3.  DSM SITES: Disable all mapped XM routines.  In step 13, we'll rebuild
     the map set with *different* routines, because many have become obsolete.
 4.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option to load
     the patch into a transport global.
 5.  On the Manage MailMan:Local Delivery Management menu, use the following
     option to stop the background filer:
        STOP background filer (XMAD)
 Are you sure you want the BACKGROUND FILERS to STOP delivering mail NO// YES
                                                                          ===
 <<< Mail Deliveries will stop momentarily. >>>
 <<   Background filer will stop before delivering the next message !!! >>>
 6.  Stop TaskMan.  You may also wish to shut down HL7 filers/LLP's and other
     background tasks which may attempt to create new messages.
 7.  Place option XMUSER out of order.  (You must do it yourself, instead
     of letting KIDS do it, because you're going to place XMUSER back in
     order during the post-init.)  To place XMUSER out of order, enter
     FileMan, and:

 13. DSM SITES: After patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
     Many routines have become obsolete and should be removed from the map
     set.  Here is a new recommended list of routines to map, should your
     site choose to map routines:

 14. This patch replaces routine ^XMRPCTS1, which contains your site's TWIX
     routing info.  In step 1, you copied the TWIX info for your site from
     that routine.  Now, edit the new ^XMRPCTS1 to set your site's TWIX info.
     Specifically:
 XMRPCTS1     ;(KC-VAMC)/XXX-Simple PCTS front end to MailMan ;03/19/98

      ;-------------------------------------------------------------
 15. For those sites using class III ^ASKX820, you should edit routine
 ^ASKX820.  It calls ENT^XMAD1, an illegal entry point which no longer exists.
 Replace it with a call to ENT1^XMD.
 16. For those sites running class III WordManager, you will have to find the
     WordManager routine containing D OK^XMA22.  For version 5.01, it's in
     routine ^WMWTWM.  It may be in other routines in other versions.
     OK^XMA22 is an undocumented entry point into MailMan which no longer
     exists.  Edit the WordManager routine as follows:
 Replace:
         S ^XMB(3.9,XMZ,2,0)="^^"_(J-1)_"^"_(J-1)
 EDIT    ;
         S DIE="^XMB(3.9,",DA=XMZ,DR=".01;3" D ^DIE

 17. For those sites using class III ^BJMAIL*, you should edit routine ^BJMAIL
 to correct its egregious violations of the SAC.  If you don't, MailMan will
 not function properly.  Once you have edited ^BJMAIL, you may delete
 routine ^BJMAIL1, since it will no longer be used.  Edit ^BJMAIL as follows:
 Replace:
 MSG    Q:'$D(T)
   ... thru ...
 WRITE  ;Write a message - not part of the main program.
 With:
 MSG     ;
         N XMINSTR
         Q:'$D(T)
         Q:'$O(T(0))
         D GROUP

         D SENDMSG^XMXAPI(FROM,TITLE,"T",.TO,.XMINSTR)
         K CONFIRM,FROM,GROUP,INFO,PRIO,T,TITLE,TO
         Q

 19. For those sites running POP3, you should load patch XM*7.1*71 immediately
     after loading this patch.  Other sites may load patch XM*7.1*71 at their
     leisure.
 20. On the KIDS:Utilites menu, use the following option to review the install:
     Install File Print
 Review the automatic domain name changes which occurred during the post-init.
 If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
 have its new name added as a synonym.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
 and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and add
 the synonym manually.  Remember, you are not to change any domain name.
 Just add the new name as a synonym.
