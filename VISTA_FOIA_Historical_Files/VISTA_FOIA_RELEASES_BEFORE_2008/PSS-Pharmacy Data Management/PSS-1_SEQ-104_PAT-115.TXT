Subject: HIPAA/NCPDP - RESTORING DAW CODE EDIT IN DRUG ENTER/EDIT OPTION

Category: 
  - Input Template
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
  
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report. 
  
 This patch restores the ability to edit the DAW CODE field through the Drug 
 Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option in the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
 application. This field was originally created by the patch PSS*1*90 (see item
 #3) but was unintentionally removed by patch PSS*1*92.
