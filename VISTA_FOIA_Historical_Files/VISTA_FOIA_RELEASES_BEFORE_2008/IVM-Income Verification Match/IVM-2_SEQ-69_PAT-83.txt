Subject: IVM BACKGROUND JOB PROCESS

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When the IVM BACKGROUND JOB is scheduled to run prior to midnight, it is 
 possible for the ENROLLMENT/ELIGIBILITY DATA (ORU~Z11) HL7 Transmission 
 from the HEC to be rejected at the site.  
  
 The records that are transmitted between 10:00 PM and midnight on the 
 west coast are actually received in a different calendar day at the HEC 
 on the east coast. Any site that is not in the same time zone has the 
 potential of receiving the following error message:
                             
             ENROLLMENT FIELD EFFECTIVE DATE IS NOT VALID
  
 The receipt of a future date for the EFFECTIVE DATE (.08) field in the 
 PATIENT ENROLLMENT (#27.11) File is rejected and documented in the IVM 
 TRANSMISSION LOG (#301.6) File as follows:
  
 TRANSMISSION SITE LOG: XXX          TRANSMISSION DATE: MAR 07,2003@01:11
   USER TRANSMITTING: POSTMASTER     HL7 REFERENCE: 74280015687-97
   ERROR MESSAGE: ENROLLMENT FIELD EFFECTIVE DATE IS NOT VALID - SSN 
   TYPE: NIGHTLY TRANSMISSION        STATUS: ERROR DURING PROCESSING
   MAILMAN ID: 173320293             ACK RECEIVED ON: MAR 07, 2003@01:28:11
   ACK MAILMAN ID: 173321618         ACK TYPE: APPLICATION ERROR
  
 Changing the scheduled run time for the IVM BACKGROUND JOB to run after 
 midnight will correct the problem.  No functionality changes are required 
 for either the sites or the HEC.
  
 Instead of changing the Enrollment processes at the HEC, this patch 
 (IVM*2.0*83) is only modifying the description of the IVM BACKGROUND JOB 
 option to include instructions on when the option should be scheduled.
  
 After the pre-install in this patch (IVM*2.0*83) has completed, the 
 description in the OPTION (#19) File for the IVM BACKGROUND JOB will be 
 modified as follows:
  
 NAME: IVM BACKGROUND JOB           MENU TEXT: IVM BACKGROUND JOB
   TYPE: run routine                CREATOR: POSTMASTER
   PACKAGE: INCOME VERIFICATION MATCH
  
  DESCRIPTION:
  
 This background job will look at the IVM PATIENT file and will transmit 
 data for all patients that had changes to their SSN, date of death, or 
 means test since the last time this option ran.
  
 This option must be scheduled to run to daily after midnight and at least 
 two hours before normal business hours.
