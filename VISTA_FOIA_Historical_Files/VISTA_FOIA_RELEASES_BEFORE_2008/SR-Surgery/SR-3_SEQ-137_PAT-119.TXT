Description:
============

 This patch is the Surgery Package part of Clinical Indicator Data
 Capture (CIDC) project.  There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs associated
 with this patch.
  
 Overview
 ========
 This patch provides the ability to capture, store, and transmit to
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) data elements required for billing 
 purposes.  
  
 Functional Description
 ======================
  1.  Modifications to the Anesthesia Data Entry [SROANES-D] menu option
      allow the entry of multiple anesthesia start and end times, as well
      as a calculation of total billable anesthesia time.
  
  2.  An Anesthesia Care Questionnaire will be added to allow a more
      complete capture of clinical data, which will support coding and
      billing efforts.
  
  3.  An Anesthesia Billable Time API will be provided to return new 
      multiple anesthesia start and end times to Integrated Billing.
  
  4.  The existing fields for entry of Referring Physician information will
      be enhanced to allow users to automatically populate the Surgery data
      using data from the NEW PERSON file (#200).
  
  5.  A process allowing a procedure code-level association to diagnosis
      will be provided.
  
  6.  A process allowing a diagnosis code-level association to Service
      Connected/Environmental Indicators will be provided.
  
  7.  New Environmental Indicator, Combat Veteran, will be provided.
  
  8.  The update to PCE will be modified to include the new billing data
      associations.  The Surgery Site Parameter UPDATES TO PCE will be
      modified to force all case data to PCE.  The Surgery Site Parameter
      ASK CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS will be modified to always ask the
      questions.
  
  9.  The PCE Filing Status Report will be modified to reflect the changes
      in data required for PCE.
  
  10.  A new field, Prin Pre-OP ICD Diagnosis Code will be provided to
       capture pre-operative information and be sent to PCE.
  
  11.  Features provided by this patch are described in the Surgery
       Clinical Indicator Data Capture Release Notes.
