Subject: REASONABLE CHARGES 2.3

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

      
 ************************************************************************
 Until the following steps are completed, the charges that are currently 
 being used are the latest active charges.  For new (2005) charges, you 
 need to load the charges that come with this patch.
        
 1) The installation of this patch from the KIDS menu (see below) will 
 inactivate Reasonable Charges V2.1, effective 12/31/04. This will leave 
 the billing department with no valid charges for Event Dates after 
 12/31/04.
  
 2) Then, after this patch is installed, IRM or the Billing department 
 needs to load the new charges for each division.  The effective date will
 be 1/1/05.
         
 Step 2 needs to be done as soon as possible after Step 1, or billing 
 will likely have problems getting rates to drop on a claim.  To 
 facilitate this, you should have already retrieved and placed the 6 rates 
 files noted in the UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS portion of this document, prior to 
 installing the patch.
      
 All of the Installation and Update instructions are contained in this 
 patch description.
     
 ************************************************************************
      
 Reasonable Charges version 2.3 is a charge update to the existing
 Reasonable Charges billed to Third Party Payers.  This patch contains 
 new DRG charges and new SNF Per Diem charges. All other charges 
 have their effective date updated.  
      
 Effective Date of Reasonable Charges v2.3 is 01/01/2005.  
    
 The Reasonable Charges v2.1 loaded on your system will be inactivated 
 with an inactivation date of 12/31/04 when this patch is installed.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. ISP-0904-N0746     REASONABLE CHARGES UPDATE
    
    Problem:
    --------           
    Changes in the national DRG rates need to be distributed to all
    hospitals so that proper billing can take place.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    This patch updates the Reasonable Charges files and distributes
    them with a new version number and a new effective date.
    
 Technical Description
 =====================
 This patch exports 2 routines, one of which is the post-init (IBYPSD).
    
 The post-init will complete the following:
    
 1.  Inactivate all existing Reasonable Charges defined in the Charge 
     Master.  Reasonable Charges v2.1 will be inactivated with an inactivation 
     date of 12/31/04 when this patch is installed.
    
 The following is an example of the post-init portion of the installation.  
    
     Reasonable Charges v2.3 Post-Install .....
    
       >> Inactivating Existing Reasonable Charges, Please Wait...
          Done.  166328 existing charges inactivated
    
     Reasonable Charges v2.3 Post-Install Complete
    
 Note:  The actual number of charges inactivated will vary based on the 
 number of divisions billed at your site.  This will also determine the
 time required for the installation.

 8.   UPLOAD REASONABLE CHARGES V2.3
      ------------------------------
      Follow the instructions below.
    
    
 ============= Reasonable Charges v2.3 Upload Instructions =============
    
 After patch installation, the RC v2.3 (Reasonable Charges v2.3) charges
 for each division billed at a site will need to be loaded into the Charge
 Master.  
    
 The charges for each Division will require approximately 1.8 - 2.0 Mb of disk 
 space. Other files will be searched, but the updates will be made to the 
 Charge Item (#363.2) file.
    
 Files Required for Upload:
 ==========================
 The charge files are available on the following CIO Field Offices' 
 Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability to 
 retrieve the files (ASCII).
     
 OI FIELD OFFICE          FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY

 Upload Instructions:
 ====================
    
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v2.3 Host Files in ASCII format (see 
 previous section).
    
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
 print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions
 that will need new charges loaded.
    
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option
 to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
 care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for
 each Billing Region. 
  
 You will see the prompt:
                
      Select one of the following:
       
            1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
            1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
            1.3       Load RC into XTMP
            1.4       Load TP into XTMP
            2         Assign Charge Set
            3         Check Data Validity
            4         Load into Charge Master
            5         Delete XTMP files
    
 Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of
 selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and waiting until 4 stops before 
 continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output
 for future reference).
    
 Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
 ---------------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
    
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
 for individual Divisions.
    
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 2.3
    
   - When loading Reasonable Charges v2.3, the IBRC0501x.TXT files may be
     used for multiple divisions without reloading.  
    
   - If there exist any previously calculated charges (files) for a division,
     they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
        The above files already exist in XTMP.
        Delete the above files and continue with upload?
     Select Yes to delete the previously calculated charges.
    
   - If there exist any previously loaded host files for any RC version,
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
     Select No if the files are IBRC0501x.TXT since these are the 
     correct files for v2.3 and you would not want to delete them.
     Select Yes only if the files are from a different version.
    
   - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
     This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing
     Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
     selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
    
 Step 5: Check Data Validity
 --------------------------------------
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for
 the first division loaded.
 From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
 If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the 
 latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.  The Error key at the 
 end of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply 
 provides definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the 
 individual line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors 
 have been detected.
 *** NOTE ***
 There are three new DRG codes distributed by patch ICD*18.0*14.  They are
 541, 542 and 543.  If you load RC v2.3 prior to loading ICD*18.0*14 you
 will see errors for these three DRG codes.  If this happens you will need
 to reload RC v2.3 after you have loaded ICD*18.0*14.
    
 Step 6: Load into Charge Master
 ------------------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
    
 It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
 upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
 another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
 complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the 
 charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded 
 serially.  
    
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report list determined previously.
    
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 -  Option 1.3, selection 2, to calculate RC v2.3 charges for a division
 -  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
    
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
 have changed it's division number, then extra care is needed to ensure
 the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide
 some additional information about the upload.
    
    
 ================ Reasonable Charges v2.3 Upload Examples ================
    
 The Charge Host Files should load with the following counts:
    
   IBRC0501A.TXT RC v2.3 Host File Upload, 1/10/05@16:04 by HOLLOWAY,T   522
