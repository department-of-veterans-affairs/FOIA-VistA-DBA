Description: 
============

  MPIF*1.0*15 is a required build for patch RG*1*19.
   
  The following revisions were recommended and approved by MPI/PD user
  representatives.  Facilities involved were Alexandria, Augusta, Battle
  Creek, Dublin, El Paso, Northern California, Providence and Tennessee
  Valley HCS.
   
  I.  Update Menu Structure and Remove Obsolete Menus and Options
  The effort in the area of menu structure was to review, standardize
  and clarify the names of all options on menu screens and all actions
  on data screens.

  - CIRN Initialization Menu [RGINIT MENU]

  - Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER] was deleted from the
     MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN COORD MENU]. (It will
     remain on the MPI/PD Patient Admin User Menu [RG ADMIN USER MENU].
   
  New Menus and Options
  ---------------------
  - Management Reports [RG MGT REPORTS] menu
  - Single Patient Audit File Print [RGMT AUDIT SINGLE] option
   
  Options Moved
  -------------
  - Pseudo-SSN Report [RGPR PRE-IMP SSN REPORT] to Management Reports 
    [RG MGR REPORTS] menu on the MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu 
    [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].
   
  - The Treating Facility List Statistics [RGMT AUDIT TF STATISTICS] 
    option was moved to the Management Reports Menu [RG MGT REPORTS]
   
  - The MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY] option was moved
    to the Management Reports Menu [RG MGT REPORTS] and the MPI/PD IRM
    Menu [RG IRM MENU].
   
  - The Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) Score Menu [RG CMOR MAIN] 
    option was moved to the MPI/PD IRM Menu [RG IRM MENU].
   
  - The Patient File Initialization to MPI [MPIFINIT DPT TO MPI] option
    was moved to the MPI/PD IRM Menu [RG IRM MENU].
   
  - The MPI/PD Event Queue Manager [RGEQ MGR] option resides on the
    MPI/PD IRM Menu [RG IRM MENU].
   
  - The Single Patient Audit File Print [RGMT AUDIT SINGLE] was added 
    to the Patient Audit Log Reports [RG TRAN/AUD AUD REP] menu. 
    (Functionality for this option had been available in Patient Data 
    Review and Exception Handling, but has now been added as a stand-
    alone option.)
   
  II.  Upgrade Help Text
  Improvements were made to the help portion of user options as
  requested by the subject matter experts and user group.  This entailed
  a complete review of all help text in the MPI/PD menus and associated
  options.
   
  III.  In routines that display text to the user, every occurrence of
  "CIRN" was replaced with "MPI/PD."  The only exception to this is if
  the term is part of a file name.
   
  IV.  For the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  routine RGEXHND1 has been modified to eliminate a discrepancy in the
  display when the date of birth is missing.
   
  V.  RGRSBUL1 has been modified to include Coordinating Master of Record
  and social security number as needed in bulletins.
   
  VI.  The Single Patient Audit File Print [RGMT AUDIT SINGLE] option now
  displays the name of the option or protocol that was used to edit the
  patient data.  This change was made in routine RGMTAUD.  The Custom Audit
  File Print [RGMT AUDIT PRINT] option now shows the option or protocol
  information as well as allowing the ability to screen the audit data by
  the user doing the editing.  These changes were made in routine RGMTAUDP.
   
  VII.  The MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY] option/report was 
  enhanced with the following.
  - the number of unresolved exceptions in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG 
  (#991.1) file for exception number 227 (Multiple ICN),
  - the number of unique patients with exceptions,
  - the number of entries waiting to be processed by the MPIF LOC/MIS
  ICN RES background job,
  - the number of entries waiting to be processed by the MPI/PD Event
  Queue processor.
   
  VIII. An undefined error was reported by Dayton, OH in NOIS message
  DAY-0801-41736.  Within the MPI/PD options, if a call is made to
  calculate the CMOR activity score, the variable ADM is not cleaned
  up.  Subsequent use of the Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER]
  option results in the error.  This has been corrected.  The CALC entry
  point referenced in DBIA #2710 was updated to NEW the variables used
  in the calculation process so that external applications are not
  adversely affected.  A new CALCI entry point was added for internal
  package use.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as CMORs, 
  treating facilities or subscribers.
