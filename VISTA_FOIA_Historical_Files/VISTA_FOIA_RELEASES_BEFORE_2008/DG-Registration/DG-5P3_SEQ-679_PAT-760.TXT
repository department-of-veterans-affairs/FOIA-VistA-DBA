Subject: FIX DELETE PTF, REGISTRATION VIEW AND CITY CHOICE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch address the following 3 issues in the Registration package:
  
 1) Users cannot delete the record from the PTF (PATIENT TREATMENT FILE)
    file (#45) using option 'Delete PTF record' after the record has been
    deleted from the INPATIENT CPT CODE file (#46).
  
 2) When the Spinal Column Injury (SCI) indicator prints at the top of
    the Registration View, it is truncating the full statement.
  
 3) Change Registration to use the CITY field (#1) of the POSTAL CODE 
    file (#5.12)  unless the CITY field is longer than 15 characters, 
    in which case, use the CITY ABBREVIATION field (#7).
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 ==========================
 1) HD153003 - Problem with delete PTF Record Option
 2) HD187275 - Problem with SCI output on Registration view 
 3) HD196518 - Need to fix the default city choice that is tied to zip
               codes

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD153003 - Problem with delete PTF Record Option
   
    Problem:
    --------
    Using the Delete PTF Record [DG PTF DELETE] option, it should be
    possible to delete a PTF record if the CPT record has been logically
    deleted.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    Routine DGPTFDEL has been changed to check the DELETE DATE field (#1)
    of the INPATIENT CPT CODE file (#46) and if the date is there, allow
    the PTF record to be deleted.
  
    
 2) HD187275 - Problem with SCI output on Registration view  
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When the SCI indicator prints at the top of Registration View, it is
    not printing the full statement and prints only "PARA," not
    "PARA,TRAMATIC"  or prints "PARA,NON" instead of "PARA,NONTRAUMATIC"
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    Routine DGRP2 has been corrected so that the full statement prints for
    Spinal Column Injuries.
  
  
 3) HD196518 - Need to fix the default city choice that is tied to zip 
               codes  
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Currently, Registration uses the CITY ABBREVIATION when an address is
    entered.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Routine DGREGAZL has been changed to to use the full city name (CITY)
    instead, but if the full name contains more than 15 characters, the
    abbreviation will be used before filing the address.
