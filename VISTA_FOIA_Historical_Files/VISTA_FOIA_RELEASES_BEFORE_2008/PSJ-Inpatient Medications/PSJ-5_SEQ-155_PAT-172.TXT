Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*163   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*172'

Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following changes:
  
 1.  A new DBIA #4537 (PSJ^PSJ53P1) was added to return data from the 
 NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  
  
 2.  The WRT^PSJ59P5 component was added to DBIA #4819. This Application 
 Program Interface (API) allows the calling routine to modify the value of 
 the DIVISION field (#.02) of the IV ROOM file (#59.5).
  
 This patch also enhances an original INPATIENT MEDICATIONS API call 
 ALL^PSJ59P5. This enhancement allows a double question mark ("??") to be
 passed in to the second parameter PSJFT. PSJFT represents the free-text
 name a user wishes to retrieve from this file. Passing "??" to the PSJFT
 parameter will cause the API to return all entries from the IV ROOM FILE 
 (#59.5). 
  
 Specifications for these APIs can be found in the Pharmacy
 Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
