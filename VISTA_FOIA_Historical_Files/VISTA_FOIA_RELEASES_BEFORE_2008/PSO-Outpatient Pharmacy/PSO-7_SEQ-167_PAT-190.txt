Description:
============

 This patch is phase 2 of the patches that support the VistA Data
 Extraction Framework (VDEF) effort, allowing changes to the PRESCRIPTION
 file (#52) to be transmitted to the Health Data Repository (HDR). The
 activation of the transmission will be handled with the sites on an
 individual basis. Until that activation occurs, the changes included in
 this patch will not affect any Outpatient Pharmacy functionality.
  
 The following build components are being exported with this patch:
  
 PROTOCOL:
    PSO VDEF RDE O11 OP PHARM PRES HR
    PSO VDEF RDE O11 OP PHARM PRES VS
    PSO VDEF RDS O13 OP PHARM PPAR HR
    PSO VDEF RDS O13 OP PHARM PPAR VS
    PSO VDEF RDS O13 OP PHARM PREF HR
    PSO VDEF RDS O13 OP PHARM PREF VS
  
 HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER:
    HDRPPAR
    HDRPREF
    HDRPRES
    PSO VDEF IE SIDE 
                       
 The routine PSOVDFK is used as the KIDS Post-Install routine to install 
 specific components for the Outpatient Pharmacy package in several VDEF
 namespace globals that VDEF uses to construct a message.  It uses the VDEF
 API POSTKID^VDEFVU to do this.  The specific components that are sent to
 Post-install routine are:
  
 1.      HL7 Message Type
 2.      HL7 Event Type
 3.      VistA Domain Subtype
 4.      HL7 Protocol Event Driver name
 5.      Application's Custodial Package name
 6.      Name of the routine that does the message extraction
 7.      VDEF Event Description
 8.      VDEF Event Subtype description
  
 The POSTKID^VDEFVU routine uses the components to create event-specific
 parameters in VDEF files.
  
  
 ** IMPORTANT **
  
 This patch cannot be installed until VDEF 1.0 is installed.
  
 Sites should not install this patch prior to your assigned HDR
 installation date. You will be contacted approximately two weeks prior to
 your HDR installation date and provided with instructions on when and in
 what order to install this patch and the VDEF software. Additionally,
 sites should not configure or attempt to utilize the VDEF software
 associated with these patches prior to your assigned HDR installation
 date, at which time Technical Support Office personnel will work with you
 to activate that application and start your data transmissions to the HDR
 database. (If you do not know your HDR installation date, you can find
 that information by going to 
 <http://vaww.teamshare.va.gov/hdr_implementation/> and selecting 
 "Implementation Schedule" from the Quick Launch panel on the left side of 
 the page.)

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit he files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
  from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
  
  FILE NAME                   DESCRIPTION
  PSO_7_0_P190_TM_CP.pdf      Technical Manual (change pages)
  PSO_7_0_TM_R1204.pdf        Technical Manual (updated)
  
  Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA Documentation
  Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
   
  This patch cannot be installed until VDEF 1.0 is installed. 
  
  This patch installs/updates several VDEF file parameters and VDEF 
  programs. If VDEF is running on your system, VDEF must be suspended while
  this patch is being installed. To suspend VDEF, go to the VDEF CONFIG 
  MENU, use the option Suspend/Resume Request Queue to suspend and restart 
  it. Then restart VDEF after installing this patch.
  
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
  Because this patch exports routines involved in the building of VDEF
  messages, and the trigger events include any action that can cause a
  status change of a prescription, this patch should be installed when
  there are no Outpatient Pharmacy users on the system, and also when
  Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not being acted upon through CPRS. There
  are also three tasked jobs that generate message exchanges between CPRS
  and Outpatient Pharmacy, and this patch should be installed at a time
  when these jobs are not running. These jobs are PSO AUTOCANCEL, PSO
  EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS, and ORMTIME RUN. Installation of this patch should
  take no longer than 3 minutes.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*190)
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*190.
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
