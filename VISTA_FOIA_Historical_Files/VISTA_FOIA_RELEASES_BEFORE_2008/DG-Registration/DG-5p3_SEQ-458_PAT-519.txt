Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*476  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*519'

Subject: FIX QUERY RESPONSE FOR FUTURE MT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Problem:    
 ========
  
 Future Dated Income Tests are not correctly being identified, and the 
 resulting IVM FULL DATA (Z07) Transmission to the HEC is not containing 
 the test data.  This is causing the Income Tests to be deleted from the 
 IVM CLIENT INCOME (#300.13) File at the HEC.
  
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
  
 The code in the Z07 Builder will be modified to correctly identify future 
 dated Income Tests when no current dated Income Test is found for the 
 Income Year in the transmission.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following E3R(s):
 ------------------------------------------
 There are no E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):

 Problem:  Means Tests are being corrupted in the INCOME YEAR sub-file 
 (#300.1313) record in the IVM CLIENT INCOME File (#300.13).
  
 Resolution:  The Future Dated Income Test API will be modified to 
 correctly identify the tests.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be 
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install. 
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
          [IVM BACKGROUND JOB]       IVM BACKGROUND JOB
  
 You may wish to stop the HL7 filers prior to the install to prevent 
 possible 'No Source Errors' from occurring. No transmissions will be lost 
 if the filers are not stopped first, they will be picked up once the 
 filers are restarted.
  
 The patch should be installed during non-peak hours.
  
  
 Install Time - 15 minutes
