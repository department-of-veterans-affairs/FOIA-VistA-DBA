 Patch XM*7.1*130
  
 NOIS: MON-1099-51059, HOU-0100-72381
 Test Site: Montana HCS
 When creating a PackMan message, and you decide to abort it while selecting
 recipients, MailMan ignores you and continues on.  MailMan has now been
 taught to listen better.
  
 E3R: 3029, 6336, 7402
 Test Site: Bronx, NY
 Allows anyone to forward a priority message to a mail group, if the site
 so chooses.  A new field has been added to file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS,
 and option XMKSP, MailMan Site Parameters, has been updated to include it.
 Here's the new field:
  
 STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #4.3 -- MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE
 STORED IN ^XMB(1,  (1 ENTRY)
 DATA     NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
 ELEMENT  TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4.3,21   FORWARD PRIORITY MAIL TO GROUP 2;1 SET
  
                            '0' FOR NO; 
                            '1' FOR YES; 
          HELP-PROMPT:      Let users forward priority messages to mail
                            groups? 
          DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES is you wish to allow users to forward
                            priority messages to mail groups.  
   
                            Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default.) 
                            Then only the message originator or anyone with
                            the XM GROUP PRIORITY key may forward priority
                            messages to mail groups.  
  
 *Note: If you do nothing with this new field, then this patch will not
 change MailMan's behavior with regard to the forwarding of priority messages.
 Only if you answer YES will the behavior change as described above.
