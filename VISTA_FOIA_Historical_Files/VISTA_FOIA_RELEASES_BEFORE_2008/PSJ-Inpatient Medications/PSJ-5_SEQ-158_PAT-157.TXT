Description:
============

  
 ********************* WARNING **********************
 *****************************************************
 If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface 
 from ILC this patch will overwrite any "local" modifications 
 in routine PSJCOMR. This could affect certain orders being 
 sent across this interface.  The modifications will have to 
 be reintroduced following installation of this patch.
 ******************************************************
 ******************************************************
  
 This patch addresses Remedy ticket HD101591.
  
 Currently, IV orders do not display an expected first dose (EFD) date/time
 to the pharmacist during the finishing process.  This problem exists whether
 the order is placed through CPRS or through backdoor entry.
 
 This patch will cause IV orders to display an EFD during the finishing 
 process unless the schedule type is "ON CALL" or "PRN".
 
  
 **NOTE** This patch does not in any way affect the current functionality
          for Expected First Dose in the CPRS GUI display.
  
 **NOTE** If the schedule type for the order is ON CALL or PRN, no Expected 
          First Dose will display for the order in backdoor pharmacy.  This
          ON CALL/PRN functionality applies to both IV AND unit dose orders.
          
          Please be aware that after this patch is installed, an EFD will no 
          longer display during the finishing process for unit dose orders
          which have a schedule type of ON CALL or PRN.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
  
 HD101591
  
 Problem
 ---------
 Currently, for IV's ordered either backdoor or through the CPRS IV Meds 
 Dialog, no "Expected First Dose" (EFD) is displayed. 
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 Display an Expected First Dose for IV orders that are created through
 the CPRS IV Meds dialog and backdoor pharmacy.  The EFD will display
 during the finishing process.
 
 *NOTE* No EFD will display during the finishing process for both IV AND 
        unit dose orders if the schedule type is ON CALL or PRN.
  
  
  
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
  
 HD101591
  
 A new subroutine, EFDIV, was added to PSJUTL to set the necessary
 variables to calculate the expected first dose for the IV orders.  This
 then calls EFDNEW^PSJUTL to complete the calculation and display of the
 EFD.  No EFD will display if the schedule type is ON CALL or PRN.
 To the other routines (PSJCOMR, PSIVORE, PSIVOPT2, PSIVORC1), a call was
 added to EFDIV^PSJUTL after the device displays the start and stop date
 for the order.  If the start date of the order is changed, or if the
 schedule is edited, the expected first dose will be calculated again
 and displayed.  The EFD is not stored for future display.
