  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:

 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
                                    
                                                                                 
 This patch represents the AR portion of the HIPAA NCPDP - Global                
 project. The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.             
                                                                                 
 Functional Description                                                          
 -----------------------                                                         
 This patch modifies the EDI Lockbox functionality by adding the ability         
 to manually process Explanation of Benefits (EOB) related to NCPDP claims.      
 There are no changes to the existing user interface introduced by this          
 patch. All changes are related to internal EDI Lockbox processing of the        
 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice (835) transaction, also referred to as         
 the Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA), related to the NCPDP electronic         
 pharmacy claims.  The 835-transaction is sent to VistA from the AAC in a        
 flat file message via MailMan.                                                  
                                                                                 
 There are two functional changes introduced with this patch:                    
                                                                                 
 1. Enhancements were made to the ECME matching procedure. As implemented        
 in the PRCA*4.5*202 patch, AR was using the Statement Date to find a            
 matching IB/AR bill. With this patch, AR will be using the Service Date for     
 matching purposes.                                                              
                                                                                 
 2. The EDI Lockbox functionality was modified to screen out electronic EOB      
 records related to electronic pharmacy rejects. When VistA submits NCPDP        
 electronic pharmacy claims and they get rejected, bills are not created in      
 IB/AR.  Therefore VistA does not need to be receiving electronic EOB records    
 in response to those claims since VistA is unable to process rejected claims    
 related to electronic EOB records. Before the changes were introduced in        
 this patch, electronic EOB records associated with rejected claims were         
 displayed on the EDI LOCKBOX EXCEPTIONS User Screen of the EDI Lockbox 3rd      
 Party Exceptions option [RCDPE EXCEPTION PROCESSING], and therefore required    
 the user to resolve manually.  The changes delivered in this patch enable the   
 software to identify these specific electronic EOB records and disregard them.  
 This means that the specific electronic EOB records are not stored in the       
 ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) and therefore are not displayed on   
 the EDI LOCKBOX EXCEPTIONS screen.                         
  
                                                                               
 Technical Description                                                           
 ----------------------                                                          
                                                                                 
 1. Enhancements to the EDI EOB Matching functionality                           
                                                                                 
 This patch modifies the EDI EOB matching algorithm that was implemented         
 earlier by patch PRCA*4.5*202.                                                  
                                                                                 
 There are two places in AR where EDI Lockbox software tries to match the        
 reference number in the EOB to an IB/AR bill number. The first routine,         
 RCDPESR4, verifies (performs matching) of the reference number in the           
 electronic EOB before the EOB is stored in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE            
 ADVICE file (#344.4). The second routine, RCDPESR2, performs the                
 same matching logic after the electronic EOB has been retrieved from            
 the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) and before storing the           
 electronic EOB in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS file (#361.1).                    
                                                                                 
 In both cases the software is calling the IB function $$RXBIL^IBNCPDPU.         
 This function has 2 parameters: the ECME Number and the Rx Fill Date. 
 Before the creation of this patch, the AR software made a call to the           
 matching IB function and had in its argument list the ECME Number and the 
 Statement Date (835-transaction Flat File, Segment '05' Piece #9). The          
 routine has been modified to replace the Statement Date with the Service        
 Date in the argument list (835-transaction Flat File, Segment '40' Piece #19).
 In order to be able to get the Service Date when processing the '05'            
 Segment, the AR software will need to pre-process the 835 Flat File             
 transaction and link the Service Date to the respective '05' segment.        
                                                                                 
 2. Excluding electronic EOB records related to the rejected NCPDP               
 Electronic Pharmacy claims.                                                     
 Routine RCDPESR6 was modified to exclude reject-related electronic EOB          
 records from the EDI LOCKBOX EXCEPTIONS screen of the EDI Lockbox 3rd Party     
 Exceptions option [RCDPE EXCEPTION PROCESSING]. To give an example, if a        
 given EOB record is not "matched" (valid bill not found), and the reference     
 number does match the ECME# format which is no less or no greater than
 7 numeric characters, and the Amount Paid on the electronic EOB is zero; then 
 AR will call the new IB function, $$REJECT^IBNCPDPU(), to check whether it
 was a rejected electronic pharmacy claim.  If all above criteria are met, 
 the electronic EOB will not be stored in the ERA DETAIL subfile (#344.41) 
 of the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4).                    
                                                                                 
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):                   
 -------------------------------------------------------------

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP IN THE
 EXACT ORDER INDICATED BELOW. ONCE STARTED, THE INSTALLATION NEEDS TO BE
 COMPLETED. FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION (ONCE STARTED) WILL
 LIKELY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR USERS OF THE 6 APPLICATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS 
 PROJECT.
  
 BEFORE PROCEEDING, please read item number 12.2 and make sure you have the
 information needed in order to complete this installation.
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of these patches. These
 patches should be installed during non-peak hours to avoid disruptions.
  
 Installation should take approximately 15 minutes.
   
 Notes: 1. You cannot queue this installation for a later time, because you
           will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
        2. DO NOT install patch PSX*2*48 when prescriptions are being
           transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
           complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        3. For existing test sites, stop the BPS NCPDP logical link.  Turn off
           the logical link using the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option, which
           is on the Filer and Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER
           LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When 
           prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter BPS NCPDP and when 
           asked whether it is "Okay to shut down this job?", enter YES.
  
  
 1.  These patches will be sent to your system upon release from the National
     Patch Module:
     
       - Patch PSS*1*90
       - Patch PSX*2*48
       - Patch PRCA*4.5*230
  
     Obtain the host file ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID, which contains the following
     three KIDS build distributions:
       
         PSO*7.0*148
         BPS*1.0*1
         IB*2.0*276
  
 Sites may retrieve the host file in one of the following ways:
  
  1.1 The preferred method is to FTP the file from download.vista.med.va.gov,
     which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
  
  1.2 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
   
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, for each of the three patches (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and
    PRCA*4.5*230), you may select to use the following options:
  
     3.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     3.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     3.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     Note: When prompted for INSTALL NAME, you should enter the corresponding
           names for each patch as shown below:
  
               PATCH                  INSTALL NAME

     set of prompts will be asked:
  
     Note: Information such as the example below about files contained in the
           build will be displayed for each KIDS build that contains Data 
           Dictionary changes:
             
                 Incoming Files:
  
                   52        PRESCRIPTION  (Partial Definition)
