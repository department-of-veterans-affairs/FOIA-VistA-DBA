Run Date: OCT 17, 2000                     Designation: XWB*1.1*14
Package : XWB - RPC BROKER                    Priority: Mandatory
Version : 1.1        SEQ #15                    Status: Released

Subject: RELEASE SOURCE CODE FOR BROKER DEVELOPMENT KIT

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This patch updates the Broker's programmer client workstation software --
 also known as the Broker Development Kit (BDK).  It adds no new
 functionality.
  
 This patch:
  
 - releases the source code for the BDK
 - splits the VistaBroker package into separate design- and run-time
 packages.
  
 The release of the source code does not affect how a developer uses the
 Broker Component or other parts of the BDK.  Modified BDK source code
 should NOT be used to create VistA GUI applications.  Suggestions for
 changes to the BDK should be done via NOIS (for bugs ) or E3R (for
 enhancements) for review and possible inclusion in another patch.
  
 The BDK now has separate run-time and design-time packages.  There is no
 longer a VistaBroker package.  The new packages are XWB_Dxx and XWB_Rxx,
 where D means Design-time and R means Run-time and where xx is two digits
 indicating the version of Delphi with which it should be used (e.g.,
 XWB_D50 is the design-time package for Delphi 5.0).  Splitting the BDK
 into separate packages resolves certain compatibility problems that arose
 from having a single run- and design-time package.  It also eliminates a
 certain problem with Delphi 5.0's dsgnintf unit that prevented users of
 the Standard edition of Delphi 5.0 from using the Broker.
  
 The run-time package should not be used to create executables that depend
 on a separate XWB_Rxx.bpl installed on client workstations.  There is no
 procedure in place at this time to reliably install the correct version of
 the run-time bpl on client workstations.  Do NOT compile your project so
 that it relies on dynamic linking with the BDK's run-time package; that
 is, do NOT check the 'Build with runtime packages' box on the Packages tab
 of the Project Options dialog.    
  
 This patch addresses issues raised in the following NOISs:
  
 POR-0200-51902     Can't install CPRSDTTM package in Delphi 4
 POR-0200-50554     When is the source code being distributed ?
 POR-0400-51704     RPC Broker Source Code
  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  
 This patch consists of 2 parts:
  
 1.  Packman message containing the XWB*1.1*14 KIDS build.  The packman
 message simply updates the version multiple of the package.
  
 2.  Updated BDK (programmer client workstation software). This version of
 the BDK supports Delphi 5, Delphi 4, and Delphi 3.  
  
 DO NOT INSTALL THIS PROGRAMMER CLIENT WORKSTATION SOFTWARE ON END-USER
 CLIENT WORKSTATIONS.  If you are not using the BDK in any local or
 national development, you do not need to retrieve the Broker's programmer
 client workstation software. The software does not update the Broker
 software that is running at end-user client workstations. Further, since
 no new functionality is added to the BDK by this patch, you do not have to
 retrieve and install it on programmer workstations unless you either want
 to see the BDK source code or need to use separate run- and design-time
 packages.
  
 The software distribution includes:

 To obtain the updated BDK, use FTP to retrieve the software from one of
 the following CIO Field Offices' ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:

 PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES:
  
 A Package may have been defined to require the Broker package.  Patch
 XWB*1.1*14 changes the identity of the Broker design-time package. If you
 try to install a package into the Delphi IDE that requires the Broker, you
 may receive an error message like:
  
       Can't load package <Package1>.
       One of the library files needed to run this package cannot be found.
  
 To resolve this problem, Open the dpk file associated with that package;
 delete the reference to the old version of the Broker in the Requires
 section; add a reference to the new design-time Broker package (XWB_Dxx)
 into the Requires section; recompile and install the package.
  
 BROKER-DEPENDENT COMPONENTS:
  
 Warning: Some components, such as the FileMan Delphi Components, reference
 the TRPCBroker component.  If you use such components for development, be
 aware that installing a new version of the TRPCBroker component (i.e. a
 new BDK) may cause incompatibilities in Delphi, resulting in a compile
 failure of the unit containing the Broker-dependent component and the
 following compilation error:
  
        Unit <unit1> was compiled with a different version of <unit2>.
  
 Check with the creators of the Broker-dependent component to make sure
 that, with regards to the version of the BDK you are about to install:
  
 a) Your current component is compatible, or
  
 b) You can obtain a new version of the component that is compatible.
  
 c) You have the source (.pas, .dfm, .dpk, etc.) files available so that
 the component can be recompiled successfully.    If you're using the
 FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC), please note that the FMDC source code
 includes references to RPC Broker Development Kit (BDK) code. When you
 install a new version of the BDK, you will need to recompile the FMDC.
    As of patch FMDC*1.0*1, source code for FMDC is provided, allowing you
 to recompile FMDC if necessary. For instructions on how to recompile FMDC,
 please refer to FMDC*1.0*2.
