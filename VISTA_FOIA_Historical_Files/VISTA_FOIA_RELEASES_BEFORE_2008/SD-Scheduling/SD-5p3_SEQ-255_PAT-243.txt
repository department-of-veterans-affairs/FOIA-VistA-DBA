Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses problems with reports under the ACRP Reports Menu 
 that were incorrectly identifying patients as having a current enrollment 
 status of 'NONE', or having a current enrollment priority of 'No
 Enrollment', as well as the Clinic Assignment Listing option not correctly
 accounting for the new 'GMT Copay Required' means test status.  This 
 patch also corrects an error that was identified during testing when
 running the "Means Test/Eligibility/Enrollment Report" and selecting
 Enrollment Priority as the category of detail with 'No Enrollment' as the
 selected priority.
