 II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 This section provides an overview of the NOIS issues addressed in this 
 patch.
  
 1. Patient Record Flag Naming Convention Issue
  
  Problem:
  The site was trying to enter a new PRF Category II (Local) Record
  Flag using a number as part of the flag name, "G6PD DEFICIENCY".
  The data entry input screen check would not allow numbers to be used 
  as part of the flag name.   
  
  Enhancement:
  The Patient Record Flag naming conventions has been changed to 
  allow numbers as part of the Record Flag Name.  A number will not 
  be allowed as the first character of flag name.
  
 NOIS References: 
 MAC-0104-62312     Patient record flag name will not accept a number
   POR-0204-51220     Number not allowed in local flag
   SLC-0804-50642     unable to put numbers in name of patient record flag
  
  
 2. Patient Record Flag Assignment Review Date Issue
  
  Problem:
  When making a Patient Record Flag assignment or when editing a
  Patient Record Flag assignment, users are unable to enter a
  Review Date that is between today and the two year maximum review
  date specified in VHA Directive 2003-048 National Patient Record Flags. 
  
  Enhancement:
  Provide a prompt for Review Date when making a Patient Record Flag
  assignment or when editing a Patient Record Flag assignment that
  would allow the user to select a date between today and the two year
  maximum review date specified in the directive (2003-048).
  
 NOIS References:

  Installation Steps:
  ===================
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routine listed in the ROUTINE
      SUMMARY section is mapped, it should be removed from the mapped
      set at this time.
  
   3. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the
      Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*623).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
      d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
    
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DG*5.3*623.
  
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
   7. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
   8. If the routine was unmapped as part of step 2, it should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
