    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Audrey Tomlinson has requested an update to the current AMIE  
    worksheet for DIABETES MELLITUS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------

       current diabetes mellitus worksheet (file #396.6 ien of 110), and 
       activate the new diabetes mellitus worksheet (file #396.6 ien of
       186).
    b) Created routine DVBCWDI2 that contains the text of the new diabetes 
       mellitus worksheet.
    c) Created routine DVBCWDIA to access the text routines in b),
       and print the new diabetes mellitus worksheet.
