Subject: MILITARY SERVICE INCONSISTENCIES REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 Developed in DEV,VOO
  
 OVERVIEW
 ========
 This patch introduces a new option to the VistA Registration System that 
 will enable users to identify patient records that contain 
 inconsistencies in the veteran's military service data.  The option will 
 run a process that will scan the Patient file and find records with 
 inconsistent military service data.  The volume of the inconsistencies 
 will be reported in a mail message sent at the completion of the 
 process.  A report detailing the inconsistencies by veteran can then be 
 printed.  This report will assist users in editing the military service 
 data to resolve the inconsistencies.  This clean-up will be done in 
 preparation for another patch that will be released at the end of June 
 that will add consistency checks to the military service fields in the 
 Patient file to maintain the integrity of the data.
  
  
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
 The following is a summary of the changes included in this patch. 
  
  
 OPTIONS:
 ========
 The following new option will be added:
  
 Military Service Data Inconsistencies Report (DG MS INCONSISTENCIES RPT) 
 - This option will produce reports of inconsistencies found in veterans' 
 military service data.  There are two parts to this option: 
   
 (1) Extract and Count Inconsistencies - this process will scan the 
 veterans' records in the Patient file and extract those that contain 
 inconsistencies.  At the completion of this process a mail message will 
 be sent with a summary report of the volume of inconsistencies found in 
 various categories.  This process must be run before the detail report 
 can be printed.  
   
 (2) Print Inconsistencies Detail Report - this process will produce a 
 detail report of inconsistencies found for individual veterans.  The 
 report can be sorted by veteran name or SSN (terminal digits).
  
 The following option will be modified:
  
 Supervisor ADT Menu [DG SUPERVISOR MENU] - The new option, Military 
 Service Data Inconsistencies Report, will be added to this menu.
