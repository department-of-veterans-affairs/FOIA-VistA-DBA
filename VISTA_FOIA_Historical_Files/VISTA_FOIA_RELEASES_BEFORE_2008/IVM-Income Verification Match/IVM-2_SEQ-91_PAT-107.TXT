Subject: REMOVE INCOME TEST INCONSISTENCY MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch along with related patch DG*5.3*655 Remove Income Test 
 Inconsistency Messages addresses the Income Test Inconsistency Messages
 that are generated when either completing or editing a completed Income
 Test. The data inconsistency messages are stored in the COMMENTS #50 field
 of the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 file. PLEASE NOTE:  these are not related
 to the messages that you get through data entry in Registration. The only
 time the Income Test Inconsistency Messages are applied is when a user is
 completing a Means Test or receiving an upload of a Means Test.
   
 Many improvements have been made to the DG MEANS TEST and DG CO-PAY 
 TEST options and it is no longer possible to cause many of the data
 inconsistencies, rendering the associated messages obsolete. Below is an 
 illustrative example.
   
 Example: After entering a dependent's sex, you can only select a
          relationship that is appropriate for that sex.  When the 
          dependent is a male, you can only enter a relationship of SON, 
          STEPSON, NEPHEW, etc.  The inconsistency message stating that 
          dependent relationship/sex are inconsistent is now invalid.
   
 There have been changes to the business rules for Income Tests that  
 render some of the Inconsistency Messages obsolete. An example of this 
 follows.
   
 Example: If you are divorced and paying child support you are able to 
          count your children as dependents. The inconsistency message 
          stating that the children must be living with you is now 
          invalid.
   
 In fact, research has determined that of the original 111 Income Test 
 Inconsistency Messages, only 17 are still valid and correct. The 
 remaining 94 inconsistency messages have either been rendered obsolete or
 invalid since Means Test Sharing was released in October 1999. All 94 of 
 these inconsistency messages are being removed with these two patches.
  
 There are two types of conditions that cause the inconsistency messages 
 that are not being removed:  (1) data entry omissions or mistakes, and
 (2) erroneous or corrupted data filed in the records.  Four of the 
 messages these patches focus on are of type (1), and the other 13 are of 
 type (2).
   
 IMPORTANT NOTE:  Only the Primary site for the Income Test can correct 
 the inconsistent data.  
   
 Please see the patch description for DG*5.3*655 for a complete list of 
 the 17 inconsistency messages that are still in use, followed by the 
 actions necessary to resolve them.
