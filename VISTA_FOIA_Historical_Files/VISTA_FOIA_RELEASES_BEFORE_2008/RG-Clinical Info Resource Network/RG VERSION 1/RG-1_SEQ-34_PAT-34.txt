Subject: SENSITIVE PATIENT BULLETIN FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 NOTE:  MPIF* and RG* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
 systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
 Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
 or subscribers.
  
 Modifications have been made to correct name format in Remote Sensitivity
 Indicated bulletin.
  
 Removed references to Scheduling API SDA^VADPT.
  
 Associated NOIS:
 ================
  
  1. HAM-1203-22022 User name backwards on MPI bulletin.
  2. ISP-0104-N1039 - Remove references to SDA~VADPT for Scheduling 
     Replacement project.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
  1. HAM-1203-22022 User name backwards on MPI bulletin.
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Site received a Remote Sensitivity Indicated bulletin with the Remote 
     User name displayed in <first name>,<last name> format.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine RGADTP to display bulletin in correct <last 
     name>,<first name> format.
   
  2. ISP-0104-N1039 - Remove references to SDA~VADPT for Scheduling 
     Replacement project.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     MPI/PD Routines reference Scheduling API SDA^VADPT, which will be 
     obsolete with the release of new Scheduling Replacement API 
     SDAPI^SDAMA301.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     It had been determined that this functionality is no longer needed in 
     MPI/PD. References to SDA^VADPT are not being replaced, they are being
     removed.  Routines RGRSWPT and RGRSWRPT are being deleted at sites.  
     Routines RGPRSSN and RGVCCMR2 are being modified.
       
     *NOTE: If RG*0.5*1 was never installed at site, routine RGRSWRPT will 
            not be found.
          
     Issue:
     ------
     Routine RGMTMONT contains a call to routine RGMTMONX that is no longer
     necessary for the remote queries sent to the site from the MPI.
    
     Resolution:
     ----------
     The line of code in RGMTMONT that references RGMTMONX will be removed.
   
     Modification:
     ------------
     A change has been made to the entry point BLDPID^VAFCQRY to support 
     passing the sequence numbers of the fields in the PID segment (Patch 
     DG*5.3*575).  Previously, even if the sequence numbers were passed, 
     all fields were included in the PID segment.  Routines RGADTP and
     RGADT1 have been modified to pass ALL for the sequence number.  This
     change is transparent to the users.

           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
