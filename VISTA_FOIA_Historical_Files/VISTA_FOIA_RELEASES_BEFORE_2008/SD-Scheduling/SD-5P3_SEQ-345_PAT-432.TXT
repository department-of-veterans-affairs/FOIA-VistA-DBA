Subject: INCORRECT DATA ON DETAILED PATIENT ASSIGNMENT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct a problem that exists with some PCMM reports, 
 where the patients' last appointment and next appointment only print on 
 the reports if they were for the same clinic contained in the TEAM 
 POSITION file (#404.57) for Associated Clinic.  The reports are:  the 
 Detailed Patient Assignment, Practitioner's Patients and Team Patient 
 Listing.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD63743 - Incorrect Data on Detailed Patient Assignment Report
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The existing logic for these reports will only print each patient's
    last and next appointment when the applicable appointment is for
    the same clinic found in the TEAM POSITION file (#404.57) for the
    Associated Clinic.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The logic in routine SCRPU3 will be changed so that the patient's
    last appointment and when applicable, their next appointment, will
    print on each report regardless of what clinic the appointments
    are for.
