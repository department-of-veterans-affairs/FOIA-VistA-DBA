 =====================
 Patch Description
 =================
 Several updates have been identified as requiring immediate action after the 
 installation of patch LR*5.2*274, AP CPT Coding & NLT Code Update.  This 
 patch LR*5.2*308 includes updates that have been identified in the NOIS's
 listed below.  The following updates are included.  
  
 1.  Currently:  If a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is not found 
 or is marked inactive in the CPT file (#81), a general message, "Nothing 
 Selected" displays, or no message at all displays.  The CPT code is not 
 selected and passed to PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTER (PCE).
  
 Update:  If one or more CPT's are not found in the CPT file (#81), 
 the following message displays and lists the CPT codes:
           "The following CPT Code(s) are not selected:
             Not found in #81: #####,#####,".
 For one or more CPTs that are marked inactive in the CPT 
 file (#81), the following message displays and lists the CPT codes:
           "The following CPT Code(s) are not selected: 
             CPT(s) inactive in #81: #####,#####".
 All CPTs that are inactive or not found in file #81 will not be passed to PCE.
  
 2.  Currently:  CPTs marked inactive in the WKLD CODE file (#64) can be 
 selected and are passed to PCE.  
  
 Update:  If a selected CPT is marked inactive in file (#64), a search is made 
 for another active CPT linked to the same workload code.  If another active 
 CPT is found, the active CPT replaces the inactive CPT and is passed to 
 PCE.  The following message will display if an active replacement is found: 
   "The following CPT Code(s) are not selected: 
     Inactive in #64\Active Replacement Found: ##### \ #####; ##### \ #####".
  
 If no active replacement found, the selected CPT is not passed to PCE and 
 is displayed in the following message:
           "The following CPT Code(s) are not selected: 
             CPT(s) inactive in #64: #####,#####".  
  
 3.  Currently:  Inactive CPTs found in the WKLD CODE file (#64) can be 
 entered and passed to PCE for non-AP accessions.  When an inactive CPT is 
 selected and passed to PCE, the entire order is marked invalid for workload 
 and no workload is passed, and a mail message is generated at the site 
 which states "No lab OOS location defined".
  
 Update:  If a CPT is found inactive in file #64, a search will be made for 
 another active replacement CPT linked to the same workload code.  If 
 another active CPT is found, the active CPT replaces the inactive CPT.  If 
 no active replacement CPT is found, the original CPT is not passed to PCE, 
 and thus no misleading mail message is generated.
  
 4. Currently:  Any subsequent CPT codes entered on an accession will 
 replace or overlay the quantity previously passed to PCE.  Example:  CPT 
 88302 with quantity of 2 entered on day 1; PCE shows quantity of 2.  On 
 day 2, CPT 88302 with quantity of 1 entered; PCE shows updated quantity 
 of 1.  It should show 3.
  
 Update:  All subsequent CPT code quantities entered for an accession will 
 be added to existing quantities stored in PCE.
  
 5. Currently:  If a selected CPT is not linked to a workload code in the 
 WKLD CODE file (#64), the CPT is passed to PCE, and the message 
 "Storing in LMIP".  This message incorrectly identifies the CPT as having 
 been stored in the WKLD CODE file (#64).
  
 Update:  Selected CPT codes that are not linked to a workload code in the 
 WKLD CODE file (#64) will not be passed to PCE, and the following 
 message will display:
           "The following CPT Code(s) are not selected: 
             Not linked to workload in #64: #####, #####".
  
 6.  Currently:  If a selected CPT code is linked to multiple workload 
 codes, the workload code with the lowest IEN is selected.  This cannot be 
 changed; however, the problem has been reduced by increasing the number of 
 allowed ES Display Order numbers that can be assigned to a specific 
 CPT-workload code combination.  The limit has been increased from 100 to 
 1000.  
 
 7.  Currently:  When more than one accession is entered for a patient on 
 the same date, at the same location, and the specimen collection date/time 
 does not contain a unique time, then each accession for this patient will 
 have the same encounter/visit number assigned when CPT codes are entered 
 and passed to PCE.  
 
 Update:  Within Anatomic Pathology (AP) Login, the "Date/time Specimen
 taken:" prompt default has been changed from TODAY (date only) to NOW
 (date and time).  This helps decrease the chance of having the same
 encounter number assigned to more than one accession entered on the same
 patient on the same date, at the same location.  
 
 8. A couple of minor cosmetic updates are included in this patch:
 a.  The prompt "Releasing Pathologist:" has been changed to "Provider:" 
 since the name entered at this prompt must be an active provider.  
 b.  The pathologist or cytotechnologist name, if entered on the accession,
 is included in the header information that displays at the time CPT coding 
 is entered.
 
 The updates described above are displayed in the following screen format.  
 This screen format is used in the menu options listed below it:

 9. A couple of general corrections are included in this patch.  For
 certain $D statements which read, "'$DATA()#2", the modulo is incorrectly 
 applied to the result of the "'$DATA()".  Instead, the NOT operator "'" 
 should be applied to the evaluation of "$DATA()#2" to correctly read,
 "'($DATA()#2)".  The following statements have been corrected:
 
 a. In SETWKL+13^LRCAPES1, Q:'$D(^LAM(LRP,0))#2, has been changed to
    Q:'($D(^LAM(LRP,0))#2).
 b. In EN5+4^LRCAPPH1, Q:'$D(^LRO(69,LRCDT,1,LRSN,2,LRTST,0))#2, has been
    changed to Q:'($D(^LRO(69,LRCDT,1,LRSN,2,LRTST,0))#2).

 Overview of NOIS / Remedy Tickets:
 
 ===========================
 CPH-0103-41645 / HD0000000069980
 
 Problem:
 It would be nice if the user was warned that the CPT code they   
 entered, is not entered in file 64 under "CODE", for a wkld file entry.    
 The screen displays "Storing LMIP Workload", but it really doesn't.  
   
 I see that there are other NOISs about "over-writing" the CPT   
 codes instead of adding to them.  That explains #5.  The clerk didn't   
 know that she should enter the multiple codes separated by commas,   
 therefore she was continually overwriting her previous entry by entering   
 one a a time.  
 
 I was thinking that lab would have to be responsible for know what they   
 put in by reviewing the code so if they were going to put in additional   
 on the next day, if there was already a quant of 1 or 2 they would have   
 to add that to the number that they are doing for the current entry...   
 but then that screws up the lmip I believe.?? don't know.. that needs to   
 go to development.

 --------------------------------
 FGH-0103-31657 / HD0000000069982
 
 Problem:
 When inputting the CPT CODES, from the patch description it states  
   
 *************************  
 The LAB CPT BILLING option can be used anytime after the accession   
 has been created. If the accession has been purged, the option cannot be   
 used. The LAB CPT BILLING option has two functions:  
   and   
 CPT billing can be done multiple  times for the same accession.   
 *************************  
 These are true statements but if a site originally put in multiple code   
 of 88342 IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY... so it would look like this ..88342,88342  
 two entries go in and the quantity goes down to PCE as 2.  
   
 BUT if the next day they do ANOTHER 88342, and go to input that cpt   
 code, when it is passed to PCE, it is overwriting the previous entry   
 that was sent that had a quantity of 2, it now present as only have done   
 1.  This is not adding to the previous work... it should be 3   
 
 Resolution:
 See Update #4 for resolution to this problem
 
 --------------------------------
 MIN-0103-41656 / HD0000000069981
 
 Problem:
 Also, I cannot figure out how to add multiples of the same CPT code AFTER  
 I leave the option, and go back to that accesssion to add more. The   
 quantity keeps appearing as 1.  
 What if you go back at a later date and need to add more?  
   
 Resolution:
 See Update #4 for resolution to this problem
 
 --------------------------------
 BHS-0103-12034 / HD0000000069988
 
 Problem:
 It appears that if a workload code has an inactivated CPT code linked to   
 it and it is used in the new LAB CPT Billing option then the inactive as   
 well as the active CPT codes are getting passed to PCE.  This is   
 different in CH-subscripted tests that pass CPT codes to PCE, the   
 inactive codes don't pass.  This issue didn't come up during the test   
 phase of the patch because we never used any workload codes with  
 inactivated CPT codes. It appears that the only way to get it to work for   
 only the active code (for the AP work) is to delete the inactive code   
 which we were told not to do because it screws up the CPT audit on a   
 workload code.

 UNY-0103-11749 / HD0000000069985
 
 Problem:
 I've been following the guidelines for the setup of file 64 with regards   
 to patch LR*5.2*274 and I have a question on section 6 of attachment 1.  I  
 set up the NLT's in section 6a through 6f instead of the generic NLT's in   
 section 6.  All the NLT's in section 6b have the CPT code 88313 assigned.   
  
 When I go into the option Lab CPT Billing, and type in 88313, it responds   
 with "SPECIAL STAINS" (which is true) and the data is stored.  When I look  
 at the workload for the accession, however, it has stored the NLT for   
 Amido Black Hemoglobin Stain wich was not correct, I wanted a Congo Red   
 Stain.  It appears that when I assigned the CPT 88313, the system took the  
  
 first entry in file 64 that it came to with that CPT code and assigned   
 that workload code to the accession.

 WBP-0103-21809 / HD0000000069986
 
 Problem:
 PLUS this - When I was testing the options in the mirror account, the CPT   
 code assocciated with the WKLD code for frozen section was a generic   
 code(88399). I inactivated that CPT code and entered the CPT code (88329)   
 that I wanted passed to PCE. I then tested the option. When I printed the   
 log book the inactivated CPT code(88399) was listed and when I checked to   
 see if it was also passed to PCE it was. See below.

 SAM-0603-21566 / HD0000000070159
 
 Problem:
 Some background:  Starting 7/1/03, Lab at Salem will start CPT coding for   
 
 AP (it is being done by coders currently).  I am ready to edit the ES   
 DISPLAY ORDER for the CYTO NLT codes.  There are 12 NLT codes that my   
 pathologist has selected for the pick list - 5 of the 12 have undesirable   
 
 CPT codes already assigned.  After patch LR*5.2*263 was installed, we are   
 
 not supposed to deleted incorrect CPT codes, rather enter the inactive   
 date and replacement codes to preserve the audit trail.  However, the   
 AP/PCE software does not "see" the inactive date and will pass incorrect   
 codes on a routine basis.

 JAC-1103-70158 / HD0000000070386
 
 Problem:
 We have a question concerning the pick list from patch 274. We have just   
 implemented the electronic signature patch and will start using the pick 
 list from 274. One   
 case that we are dealing with has an active and an inactive code under the 
 workload code.   
 We have the pick list set up to choose the number, but in choosing the 
 number, it lists   
 both the active and inactive CPT codes as being assigned. We tried to see 
 whether or not   
 it passed to PCE, but it was an inpatient OR case, so they weren't there.

 Problem:
 New test was set up for BHCG.  NLT code has been linked. CPT code associated 
 with the NLT code has a release date in file 64, and is active in file 81.  
  
 Another test for same pt, location, provider, accession area works fine, so 
 problem seems to be related to this specific NLT/CPT.  It appears that lab 
 is sending the info, but a visit is not being created in PCE.  
   
 I have tried deleting NLT from file 60 and relinking.  Also tried removing
 CPT code from 64 and adding back.   In addition to the current CPT code, 
 this file 64 entry also has an old CPT code with an inactivation date, (NOIS: 
 WRJ-0403-11668), but I haven't tried deleting the inactive code as it appears 
 lab is sending info and I don't like the idea of deleting unless absolutely   
 necessary.   
   
 Is there a way to trace in PCE what was sent from lab and try to pin down 
 why this code isn't passing.

 ordered the tests individually and the visits were generated fine, but as   
 a group they appear not to generate the visit number.  Please see Lab

 One of the labs in our VISN called me today & said that they had a   
 patient that had 3 Cytology & 1 Surg path Accession numbers for samples   
 all on the same day.  After entering the CPT codes, (using the "ES"  
 numbers), PCE showed only 1 LAB encounter with the CPTs for only the first
