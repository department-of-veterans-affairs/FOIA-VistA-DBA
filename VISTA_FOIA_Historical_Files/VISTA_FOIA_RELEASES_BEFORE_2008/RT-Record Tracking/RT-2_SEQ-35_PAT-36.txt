 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1. PUG-0503-50947  RT Routine allows entry of date with no time
 
    Problem:
    -------
    When using the Record Inquiry [RT INQ-INQUIRY] or the Expanded Record
    Inquiry [RT INQ-MEDIUM] options some dates are displaying in their
    internal format (303010100000) instead of their external format
    (01-01-2003).  This behavior has been observed for dates in the
    "Since..." field and in the RECORD REQUEST PROFILE section the "Date
    Needed" field.  This situation occurs when a date is entered without a
    corresponding time, such as when the user enters "T" which causes
    todays date to be entered without the current time.  The software
    attempts to append a time value to the date, but in the process creates
    an invalid internal date/time format.  This causes the internal date 
    not to be converted to the external date when it is displayed.
 
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified the programs listed in the routine summary to append a time
    to the internal date correctly.  This was done by adding a period
    between the date and the appended time to create a valid internal
    date/time format.  This will allow the date and time field to
    convert from internal to external format and display appropriately.
    Example:  303010100000  to  3030101.00000

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
   
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                               ---
                                                                
           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution 
           Backup a Transport Global  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RT*2.0*36):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RT*2.0*36.
  
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
          YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated).
      b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? YES//', answer YES.

  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
     
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
