 Authority:
 ==========
 Effective October 15, 2002, the Centralized Means Test (CMT) Pilot, 
 deployed in 1995 by the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) will be 
 discontinued.  Authority providing for this action is outlined via a 
 memorandum dated September 27, 2002 from the Chief, Business Officer (16)
 to the Network Directors of VISNs 1 and 6.   
  
 History:
 ========
 Patch EAS*1*12 changed the functionality in the Background search for MT 
 Anniversary dates [EAS MT LETTERS BG SEARCH] and the Search For MT 
 Anniversary Dates [EAS MT LETTERS SEARCH] options for those sites 
 identified as DCD Pilot sites.  The modified processes perform a check 
 during the search to determine if a site is a DCD pilot site.  If the site
 is determined to be a DCD site, when the letters are added to the EAS MT
 Letter Status file (#713.2), instead of the 60-day letters being flagged
 to print first, the 0-day letters will be flagged.  This change in
 functionality was due to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requiring DCD
 sites to send ONLY 0-day letters to veterans.  The HEC handles
 intermediary letters.
  
 Functional Changes Description:
 ==============================
 Given the mandate to discontinue the Centralized Means Test (CMT) Pilot by
 October 15, 2002, the HEC will no longer create new DCD cases nor generate
 initial letters to veterans on an automated basis.    The HEC will retain
 the ability to open new cases and edit/close existing cases where
 necessary.  These functional changes are being implemented at the  HEC by
 patch IVMB*2*714.  This patch is not accessible via the national patch
 module on FORUM, as it does not affect VistA software directly.
  
 Based upon the change in functionality being implemented at the HEC, the 
 DCD pilot sites must have the ability to generate the 60-day notification
 letters to veterans on or after 10/15/2002.  An additional check is placed
 in the routine EASMTL2 that will allow DCD pilot sites to install this
 patch before 10/15/2002 without affecting current functionality.  In other
 words, the software will continue to flag the 0-day letters until 
 10/15/2002.  Once the date of 10/15/2002 comes, the software will start 
 flagging the 60-day letters.  This behavior is consistent with non-DCD 
 sites.  The letter search processes generate a mail message indicating 
 statistical results for each run.  Patch EAS*1*12 modified the routine 
 EASMTL1 to update the search message to display the 0-day letter tag for 
 DCD pilot sites.  As previously stated, this functionality behaves in the
 same manner until 10/15/2002 is reached.  Once this occurs, the search 
 message will revert to displaying the 60-day letter flag for all sites.
  
 Post-Installation Description:
 ==============================
 This installation contains a post-install routine EAS120P, which will 
 queue a task to run on those sites determined to be DCD pilot 
 facilities.  This patch must be installed before 10/15/2002 in order to 
 meet the mandated timeline for the DCD pilot discontinuation.  Again, all
 aspects of the functionality are date sensitive and should not affect 
 current business methodology.  The task queued by the post-installation
 routine will update the value of the CURRENT VERSION field (#13) in the
 PACKAGE file (#9.4) to null for the entry named "IVMC".  This entry will
 not exist in non-DCD pilot sites and therefore as a result the 
 post-installation will not queue a task to run.  The task will be 
 scheduled for 10/15/2002@00:01.  No output is associated with this 
 post-installation.
