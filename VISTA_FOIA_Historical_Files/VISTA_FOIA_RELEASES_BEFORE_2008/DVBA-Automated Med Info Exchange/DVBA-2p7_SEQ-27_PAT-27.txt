  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
  disruption to users. Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
 
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*27):
 
 Note - if a multi-build install, options (b.) (c.) and (d.) must be run for
 each individual patch/build included in this transport.  Only (a.) Backup a
 Transport Global and Installation (step 5) can and must be referenced
 exclusively by the primary patch. 
 
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*27.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        INSUFFICIENT EXAM REPORT         DVBA C INSUFFICIENT EXAM RPT
      
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
