Associated patches: (v)XU*7.1*45       install with patch       `XM*7.1*8'

Subject: MSM-NT Enhancement

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 The present code limits the number of characters that can be read in a 
 single chunk from a TCP/IP line to prevent maximum length (MXSTR) errors.
 The new MSM NT code waits until "n" characters are in the buffer of a
 R#n:TO command -- older code just handed over what was there.  Earlier
 versions of MSM (and DSM, etc.) could read in more characters than a local
 variable could legitimately hold.
  
 XMLTCP is the routine that implements a more flexible and better TCP/IP
 channel reading and writing algorithm.  Changes to other routines (XMRTCP,
 XMRTCPGO, XMRINETD, XMS, XMS0, XMS1, XMCDNT and XMS5) are needed to make
 this the default protocol for outgoing transmissions.
  
  
 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<           NOTE             >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  
 Installation for this patch consists of two steps.  Step I unloads PackMan
 routines.  If you don't have MSM-NT, you only need to perform Step I. Step
 II only applies to sites that have MSM-NT installed.
  
 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<                             >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  
  STEP I  : Unloads PackMan routines
  ======
  
            Save a copy of the routines either before you begin this
            installation or when requested to do so during the unloading
            of the specified PackMan message.  
  
  NOTES:  o There are no differences in the installation on an ALPHA, or on
            a 486 platform.  
          o Users may NOT be on the system during the installation of the
            MailMan network patch.
          o There is no TARGET or NOIS report associated with this patch.
  
  1.  Check mapped routine set and unmap the appropriate MailMan routines.
  
  2.  Install the PackMan message into your production account.
  
  3.  Execute CHECK^XTSUMBLD to compute checksums for the following
      routines:
  
           XMCDNT    value = 401792
           XMLTCP    value = 2233803
           XMRINETD  value = 363486
           XMRTCP    value = 3219803
           XMRTCPGO  value = 2862153
           XMS       value = 5938186
           XMS0      value = 9594337
           XMS1      value = 7363462
           XMS5      value = 11986202
  
           *Stop installation, reload the original routines and call your
            supporting ISC if these values do not match.
  
  4.  Move the newly installed routines to all DHCP systems (as
      appropriate).
  
  5.  Check mapped routine set and map the appropriate routines into the
      routine set.  Rebuild the mapped routine set.
  
  **Note: For non-MSM-NT systems, installation for patch XM*7.1*8 is
          complete.  The following instructions are intended for sites that
          are going to install MailMan TCP/IP on a MSM-NT system.  If
          assistance is needed to setup of a MSM-NT system, please call
          your IRM support people.

  MAILMAN INSTALLATION 
  USING TCP/IP CHANNELS 
  ON MSM-NT
  
  Revised 7-25-95
  
  
  
  1. INTRODUCTION
  
  Once you have installed and configured your brouter, connected the NT box
  onto the production LAN, configured MSM on NT, and installed MailMan 7.1,
  you will be ready to implement TCP/IP mail.  TCP/IP mail uses 56Kb lines
  over IDCU to create very fast virtual circuits to other TCP/IP machines
  on the network.  
  
  2. SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
  
  2.1 Install TCP/IP mail patches
  
  Certain patches and versions must be in place for TCP/IP mail to work.
  You must minimally be at MailMan version 7.1 and be fully patched. Patch
  8 and 13 are especially important, since TCP/IP mail will not work if
  these are not installed. 
  
  2.2 Verify Communications Protocol file (3.4)
  
  Verify the TCP/IP-MAILMAN record in the Communications Protocol file. You
  should already have this record in the file but you will have to modify
  it.  Make sure your record EXACTLY matches this example.
  
  NAME: TCP/IP-MAILMAN
  SEND: D SEND^XMLTCP I $G(XM)["D" S XMTRAN="S:"_$E(XMSG,1,242) D TRAN^XMC1
  RECEIVE: D REC^XMLTCP I $G(XM)["D" S XMTRAN="R: "_$E(XMRG,1,242) D
           TRAN^XMC1
  OPEN: S (X,XMLINE,XMLCHAR,XMLER,XMLST,XMNO220)=0,XMLTCP="",XMSTIME=60
  CLOSE: K XMLTCP L -^XMBX("TCPCHAN",XMHOST) Q
   
  Review this text to verify no typos and that the case of the text 
  matches the example.
  
  2.3 Edit Transmission Script file (4.6) 
  
  Add a new record to the Transmission Script file containing the MSM
  specific commands to OPEN and USE TCP/IP devices.  The new script will
  only have to be added once.
  
  NAME:  TCPCHAN-SOCKET25/NT
  TEXT
  X L +^XMBX("TCPCHAN",XMHOST):99 E  S ER=1,XMER="CHANNEL IN USE"
  X S X="ERRSCRPT^XMRTCP",@^%ZOSF("TRAP")
  X S XMRPORT=56 O 56::30 E  S ER=1 L - ^XMBX("TCPCHAN",XMHOST)
  X U 56::"TCP" W /SOCKET(XMHOST,25) S XMKEYTCP=$KEY
  X I XMKEYTCP="" S ER=1 C 56 L  Q
  X S XMHANG="S IOST(0)=0",IO=56,IOT="TCP",XMSTIME=30
  MAIL
  X L -^XMBX("TCPCHAN",XMHOST) K XMSIO,XMKEYTCP
  
  Review this text to verify no typos and that the case of the text 
  matches the example.

  2.13 Add a null device to Device file (3.5)
  
  A new system device is available in MSM-NT version 4.2.2.  A true null
  device has been implemented as $I of 46. This is a system level device
  and does not have to be SYSGENed by the system manager.  A NULL device
  can now be added as a selectable device in the Device file:

  ASK DEVICE: YES
  ASK PARAMETERS: NO
  ASK HOST FILE: ^ 
  
  You should now be able to open this device on the GSA sytem with 
  the device handler.
  
  2.14 Edit Domain file (4.2)
  
  Now you must change the Domain file to use the new TCP/IP protocol and
  script.  Only the domains that you change will use TCP/IP mail.  The
  domains that you do not edit will still use the old IDCU style
  connection.  It is very important that you follow the example below for
  the Domain file edit. There is a list of TCP/IP-ready sites on the DBA
  menu on FORUM under option "TCP Printout".  You can get a list of valid
  sites and addresses there.  This list will help you find sites that can
  send to via TCP/IP.

  220 ISC-CHICAGO.VA.GOV MailMan 7.1 ready
  
  Note:  Verify the correct response above before continuing with the rest
  of the TCP/IP MailMan setup.  If you receive a message from the host
  other than "220 domain-name MailMan 7.1 Ready" then do not continue.
  Review all the above setup steps and contact your ISC.
  
  2.15 Setting up additional Domains for TCP/IP mail
  
  NOTE:  On Forum you can list TCP/IP mail sites and their address.  At the
         Forum prompt just ^TCP to jump to the listing.
  
  The following method can be used to find the sites you exchange mail with
  most often.  You can use this to prioritize the sites you wish to send
  mail to via TCP/IP.  Remember that you can only control how you send mail
  to other sites, you cannot control how other sites send mail to you.

  Once a domain has been configured and tested to work with TCP/IP mail,
  adding additional domains is very simple.  The Communications Protocol
  file and Transmission Script file do NOT have to be modified again.  All
  subsequent domains will use the same TCP/IP protocol and transmission
  script.  Only the domain file will have to be edited.  
  
  Be sure the site has TCP/IP mail setup and working.  This example shows
  the setup of TCP/IP mail to ISC-CHICAGO, which has TCP/IP mail enabled.
  If you can use XMCDNT to verify the address then you are ready to play
  the script.
  
  **Note to system managers:  Operators will not be able to play a TCP/IP 
  scripts from any machine other that the GSA machine.  The TCP/IP 
  capabilities only exist on the GSA node.  When interactively playing 
  a script the default script will be the highest priority script.

  3. Network Mail Management with TCP/IP
  
  DHCP mail should be able to recover from several component failures on
  the WAN.  This section will describe
  
  3.1 Trouble-shooting Tools
  
  The following troubleshooting tools are additional tools to help you 
  identify problems with TCP/IP mail transmissions:
  
  Use the FTP utility to verify TCP/IP functionality of a remote host.  
  By selecting different hosts you can determine whose equipment is not
  working properly.
  
  Use the ^XMCDNT routine to verify TCP/IP addresses and working mail
  listeners.
  
  Record all outgoing scripts.  Simply edit the RECORD NETWORK
  TRANSMISSIONS field in the Kernel Site Parameter file (if running Kernel
  7.1).  If you are running Kernel 8, the field will be in the MAILMAN SITE
  PARAMETER file.  The mail dialogue  will be recorded in ^TMP(XMC.  Note
  that you should turn off this feature when finished testing, otherwise
  all transmission scripts will continue to be recorded in ^TMP(XMC and can
  potentially fill up the disk.  A cleanup utility does not exist to remove
  recorded text from ^TMP(XMC and will have to be killed off manually by
  the system manager.
  
  3.2 Management Tips
  
  Keep these tips in mind when setting up the first TCP/IP mail domains.
  
  1.  System managers will have to inform other staff members that 
  TCP/IP scripts cannot be played from the print or compute servers.  When
  interactively playing a script the user will be prompted with the highest
  priority script (i.e. priority number 1) as the default.  If you play the
  script from the print or compute server you will have to select the old
  IDCU script.
  
  2.  The GSA system will only have a subset of DHCP routines (i.e. Kernel,
  FileMan, and MailMan).  You will not be able to run other core
  applications from the GSA system.
  
  3.  When you are ready to have other system managers send TCP/IP mail
  transmissions to you, you can publish your TCP/IP address on Forum.  Just
  send a message to Lee Hirz on Forum with your TCP/IP address indicating
  that you would like to be added to the list of TCP/IP ready sites.  Other
  system managers will then see your address as available for TCP/IP mail
  on the DBA menu on Forum.
  
  4.  Remember that the system manager can only determine how network mail
  is sent, not how it is received.  The protocol used for transmission
  (e.g. TCP/IP, SWP, etc) are alwasy determined by the sender.
