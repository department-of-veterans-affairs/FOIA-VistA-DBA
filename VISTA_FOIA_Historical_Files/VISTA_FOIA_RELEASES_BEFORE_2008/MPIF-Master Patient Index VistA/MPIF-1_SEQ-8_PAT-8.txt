Subject: ACK Timeout, Potential Match Display, Display Only Query, and ACKs

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
   release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
   installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
   Implementation Manager for CIRN.
   
  
   ISSUE 1:  It was reported by Northampton that when the potential match 
   list has just one entry, the comparison between the data fields isn't
   comparing the same name components.  This has been corrected in routine
   MPIFQ0.
  
   ISSUE 2:  It was reported by the CIRN developers that the field Mother's
   Maiden Name is not displayed during the Display Only Query when it is 
   returned from the MPI.  This has been corrected in routine MPIFQ1.
  
   ISSUE 3:  It was reported by Madison that when using the Single Patient
   Initialization action on the CIRN Exception List Manager screen, the
   ACK timeout is not at 300 seconds.  This has been corrected in routine
   MPIFSAQ.  NOISes: MAD-0700-42050, POR-0800-52046, BRX-0800-11873
  
   ISSUE 4:  It was reported by the CIRN developers that when selecting a 
   patient from a list of potential matches, the Treating Facility and 
   Subscription "add me" messages were not being triggered.  This has been
   corrected in routines MPIFQ1 and MPIFQ0.
  
   ISSUE 5:  It was reported by the CIRN developers that sometimes they
   could update and ICN when the "AICN" cross-reference already existed
   and sometimes they couldn't.  The business rule allows for an ICN to
   be updated when the "AICN" cross reference already exists, only if the 
   patient DFN is the same.  There was one situtation where that wasn't 
   allowed. That has been corrected in MPIFQ1.
  
   ISSUE 6:  It was found that several of the MPI HL7 messages were not
   being delivered via HL7 due to network issues.  HL7 thought that these
   messages had been delivered but they hadn't made it to the destination
   site.  In order to prevent this, HL7 commit ACKs are being turned on
   for the following protocols (both Client and Server protocols being
   exported in the build):
  
         MPIF A28 REQUESTS
         MPIF A29 SERVER
         MPIF A30 SERVER
         MPIF CMOR APPROVE/DISAPPROVE
         MPIF CMOR COMPARISON SERVER
         MPIF CMOR REQUEST
         MPIF CMOR RESULT SERVER

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
   
    2.  Stop Inbound HL7 filer(s) via the "Monitor, Start, Stop Filers"
        option on the "Filer and Link Management" menu which can be found
        on the "HL7 Main Menu".  
   
    3.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    4.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
   
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*8.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.  Please put the following options
        out of order:
   
          MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY        Display Only Query
          MPIF IND MPI LOAD      Single Patient Initialization to MPI
          DG REGISTER PATIENT    Register A Patient
          DG LOAD PATIENT DATA   Load/Edit Patient Data
          DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION      10-10T Registration
       
         ** It is suggested placing the DG options out of order since
         the real-time connection with the MPI can be made via the options
         and the routines involved are included in this patch.
   
    10.  Restart the HL7 Inbound filer(s) via the same options in step #2.
