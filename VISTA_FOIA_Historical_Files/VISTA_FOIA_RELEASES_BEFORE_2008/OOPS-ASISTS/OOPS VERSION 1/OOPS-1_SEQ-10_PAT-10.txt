  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  
      * This patch must be installed immediately after OOPS*1.0*8.  This is 
        due to dependencies between the two patches that occurred because
        the functional requirements for OOPS*1.0*8 changed and needed to be
        incorporated into this patch.
  
 There are two enhancements in this patch as well as upgraded error checking 
 on date fields that impact the electronic transmission of claims to the 
 Department of Labor.  The enhancements have been made at the request of the 
 program office and the technical advisory group (TAG).
 
 The Bill of Rights enhancement modifies the text of the Bill of Rights to 
 better state the employee's rights.  It also includes three new questions that
 will be asked from the ASISTS Employee Menu [OOPS EMP MENU], the Complete 
 Employee CA1/CA2 [OOPS EMP ENTRY] and Validate and Sign CA-1 or CA-2 
 [OOPS EMP VALIDATE] option.  The first question asks if the Employee has 
 read and understands the Employee Bill of Rights.  If the employee responds 
 that they do not understand, a bulletin will be sent to the Worker's 
 Compensation Representative advising them to provide assistance to that 
 employee.  Although the employee can complete the form, the employee CANNOT 
 electronically sign the claim until they answer the question positively (Yes).
  
 The second part of this enhancement asks the employee if they give their 
 consent to provide additional information regarding the incident to the 
 union for accident and occupational illness tracking purposes only.  In 
 order to identify which Union representative the bulletin should be sent to 
 a new option, Enter/Edit Union Information [OOPS WC EDIT UNION INFO] has 
 been added so that the necessary Union information can be captured.  This 
 option will be described below.  A bulletin will ONLY be sent to the union if 
 the employee gives their consent and will NOT contain their name, address, 
 SSN, DOB, or telephone number.  The consent question will be asked after the 
 employee signs their portion of the claim.  If the employee answers the 
 consent question yes, they will be asked to select the Union the bulletin 
 should be sent to.  After selecting the Union, the bulletin will be sent.  
 If the employee must re-sign the claim for any reason, the consent question 
 will be asked again.

 ******************* End of Screen Capture ******************************
  
  
 Once the employee indicates that they have read and understand the Bill of 
 Rights the question is no longer asked.  Therefore, the employee will only 
 see the question if they have not previously answered it or they have 
 answered it with No.  A bulletin [OOPS WCPBOR] will be sent to the Worker's 
 Compensation Representative (OOPS WCP mail Group) when the response is No.
  
 An option has been added so that the Union information can be entered 
 and/or edited.  This option is the Enter/Edit Union Information [OOPS WC 
 EDIT UNION INFO] and it is on the ASISTS Worker's Compensation Menu [OOPS 
 WORKER'S COMP MENU].  This option populates the ASISTS UNION INFORMATION 
 Table file (#2263.7).  All participating Unions need to be entered in this 
 option including a Union acronym and Union Representative.  If the employee 
 grants permission to send their incident information to the Union the mail 
 bulletin [OOPS CONSENT] will be sent to this Union representative.  
 Updating this table is important so that information is properly sent to 
 the Union, as appropriate.

 ************************** End of Screen Capture **************************
  
  
 The second enhancement provides a mechanism to allow the Workers' 
 Compensation (WC) specialist/representative to electronically sign the
 employee portion of a CA-1 or CA-2 claim if the employee is not able to sign
 for themselves.
  
 Three (3) new options have been added.  Approve Workers' Comp Signing for 
 Employee [OOPS SAFETY WCP EMP SIGN] on the ASISTS Safety Officers Menu 
 [OOPS SAFETY MENU], Approve Workers' Comp Signing for Employee [OOPS EMP 
 HLT WCP EMP SIGN] on the ASISTS Employee Health Menu [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU], 
 and Workers' Comp Elect. Sign For Employee [OOPS WC SIGN FOR EMPLOYEE] on 
 the ASISTS Worker's Compensation Menu [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU].
   
 The first step in providing the WC Specialist the ability to sign for the 
 employee is to obtain the Ok from the Safety Officer and Employee Health 
 representative.  This is accomplished by using the options listed above to 
 electronically sign that the WC specialist can sign for the employee.  Two 
 signatures from different individuals/disciplines are required due to the 
 potential liability of signing the claim for the employee.  Additionally, 
 the WC Specialist CANNOT sign as either the Safety Officer or Employee 
 Health Representative and then sign for the Employee.  Three different 
 individuals must be involved in this procedure.
  
 After the Safety officer and Employee Health Representative electronically 
 sign the claim, the Workers' Compensation specialist/representative can 
 electronically sign for the employee using either the Complete Employee 
 CA1/CA2 [OOPS EMP ENTRY] or the Workers' Comp Elect. Sign For Employee 
 [OOPS WC SIGN FOR EMPLOYEE] option on the ASISTS Worker's Compensation Menu 
 [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU].
  
 If the claim is signed by the WC representative and it is later determined 
 that the Employee can sign for themselves, the Employee can access the 
 claim using the Complete Employee CA1/CA2 [OOPS EMP ENTRY] option from the 
 ASISTS Employee Menu [OOPS EMP MENU] provided the claim has NOT been signed 
 by the Supervisor.  The WC representative's electronic signature is removed 
 and the claim would need to be re-signed.
  
 A claim signed by the WC representative, can ONLY be accessed by that WC 
 representative or the Employee.  Again, providing that the Supervisor has not 
 electronically signed their portion of the claim.  If access by a different 
 WC representative is required, the original WC representative will need to 
 access the Complete Employee CA1/CA2 [OOPS EMP ENTRY] from the Workers' 
 Compensation Menu [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU].  In doing this, the original WC 
 representative's electronic signature will be removed and the claim can be 
 accessed and signed by another WC representative.
  
 If the Workers' Compensation representative is signing for the employee 
 from the Workers' Compensation Menu [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU] the Bill of 
 Rights questions ARE NOT asked.  The consent bulletin will not be sent to 
 the union as the employee cannot give explicit consent.
