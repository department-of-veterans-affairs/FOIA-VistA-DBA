Subject: BUILDING OF DEFAULT LOINC CODE IN LAB HL7 RESULT (ORU) MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*63 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 Patch LA*5.2*63 corrects a defect in LOINC encoding of test results in
 the OBX segment of a Lab HL7 Result (ORU) message. The segment building
 routine LA7VOBX1 was failing to check and use a default LOINC code when
 available if the test results have not been LOINC mapped. The software
 will check and use the default LOINC code when results are not LOINC
 mapped.
