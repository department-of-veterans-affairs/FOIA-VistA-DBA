 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. PRO-0903-11795   UNDEFINED VAR ECXPCF
      
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report [ECX CLN 
    STOP REP], if the report is put to queue the report gets an error.
    The error is "undefined variable ECSPCF," error code M6.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When the user starts the report, they are given a choice of Active 
    Clinics, Inactive Clinics, or Both. This input is stored in ECXPCF. 
    But in the piece of code that saves the input for queuing, the 
    variable tag was misspelled as ECSPCF instead of the correct ECXPCF.
    The typo has been corrected.

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
    
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...

           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)

          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
