Subject: PRIME VENDOR PC - MO'SLO 4BIZ

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 With upgrades to Pharmacy Prime Vendor systems, the ProComm Plus script
 files used in Drug Accountability/Inventory Interface V. 3.0 may
 result in error.  This problem occurs because the newer PCs provided by
 the Pharmacy Prime Vendors run too fast for the version of ProComm Plus in
 use. To remedy this problem, a software product, Mo'Slo has been purchased
 by the Office of CIO.  Copies of this software will be made available by
 request. These requests should be submitted to the National VISTA Support
 Help Desk (1-888-596-4357). Upon receipt of the request, the software and
 installation instructions will be sent electronically using MS Exchange.
  
 The Mo'Slo software slows down processing for the application defined.
 The reduced speed only effects the ProComm Plus software and does not
 impact other applications running on the Prime Vendor PC.
  
 Instructions for installing and implementing Mo'Slo on the Prime Vendor
 PC are provided in a text document titled MOSLO4B.TXT.  This document will
 be distributed with the software.
