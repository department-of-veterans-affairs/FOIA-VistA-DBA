Subject: ENCAPSULATION ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 This patch enhances an original Pharmacy Data Management API Application
 Programming Interface (API) call DATA^PSS50.  By replacing FileMan calls 
 with direct reads, data retrieval speeds from the DRUG file (#50) have 
 been greatly improved. Specifications for this API can be found in the
 Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
  
 This patch also enhances an original Pharmacy Data Management API call 
 ALL^PSS51P2.  By replacing FileMan calls with direct reads, data 
 retrieval speeds from the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2) have been greatly
 improved. Specifications for this API can be found in the Pharmacy
 Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual. This API has also been enhanced to return
 an "IV" cross-reference which can be used to identify entries that have
 the IV FLAG field (#6) set to Yes.
  
 Additionally, this patch introduces an API STATUS^PSS55MIS which requires
 three parameters.  The set of codes for STATUS field in the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55) subfiles is returned. This API will invoke the
 FIELD^DID Fileman call and data will be returned to the calling
 application as specified in the FIELD^DID FileMan documentation. 
 Specifications for this API can be found in the Pharmacy Re-Engineering
 (PRE) API Manual.
  
 Finally, this patch introduces CLINIC^PSS55MIS which requires three 
 parameters. This API returns a clinic from the HOSPITAL LOCATION file 
 (#44) based on a provided order number and patient DFN.  This API invokes 
 the GETS^DIQ data retrieval call.  Specifications for this API can be 
 found in the Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch exports a routine that can be invoked by any Vista application
  in accordance with some supported references. For that reason, it is

         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
