Description:
============

 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*71 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*71 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*71 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation
 of this patch.
  
  
 NOIS NCH-0105-417985 reported the inability to verify corrected
 Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) results when the reference
 (host) laboratory removes the previously reported result and changes the
 result to 'pending'. The result of 'pending' was not being sent to the
 collecting facility via LEDI HL7 messaging.
  
 This patch allows users at the collecting facility who are verifying
 reference laboratory results to release amended (corrected) results
 that are 'pending'.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 -------------------------
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory

   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
         option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LA*5.2*71):
         a. Print Transport Global
         b. Backup a Transport Global
         c. Compare Transport Global to Current System
         d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
       Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*71'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
       The install will automatically disable the following options:
  
        Accession order then immediately enter data LR ACC THEN DATA
        Batch data entry (chem, hem, tox, etc.) [LRSTUF]
        Bypass normal data entry [LRFAST]
        Enter/verify data (Load list) [LRVRW2]
        Enter/verify data (Work list) [LRVRW]

        Fast Bypass Data Entry/Verify [LRFASTS]
        Group verify (EA, EL, EW)[ LRGV]
        Special test accessioning [LRNONCOM]
  
   6.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
