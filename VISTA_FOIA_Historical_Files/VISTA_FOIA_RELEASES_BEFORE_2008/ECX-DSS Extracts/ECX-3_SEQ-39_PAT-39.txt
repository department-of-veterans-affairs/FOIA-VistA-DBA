   patch description.
   
            Warning: Do not attempt to install this     
                     patch until you have received     
                     specific approval from the local

   Please note: 
   
   Patch ECX*3*39 is the FY2002 Update for DSS EXTRACTS v3.0.
   
  
   Sites should ensure that all FY2001 extracts have been generated,
   transmitted to Austin, and processed in DSS.  After this has been
   accomplished, sites should contact the Help Desk at the Bedford
   Technical Services Office (BTSO) to request the KIDS Distribution file
   for ECX*3*39.  Call (781) 275-9175.

  2) MODIFIED FILES
  
   a) The file DOM PRRTP SAARTP ETC (#727.831) has been renamed to the
      DSS TREATING SPECIALTY TRANSLATION file and contains the following 
      new fields:
  
         FIELD NAME: OBSERVATION PAT INDICATOR
         NODE,PIECE: [0,4]
        DESCRIPTION: This field contains the observation patient indicator
                     which is based on the treating specialty and
                     inpat/outpat code values of the record.
  
         FIELD NAME: INPAT/OUTPAT CODE
         NODE,PIECE: [0,5]
        DESCRIPTION: This field contains the inpatient/outpatient status
                     which is based on the treating specialty value of the
                     record. It replaces the IN/OUT CODE field (#3) of 
                     this file.
  
         FIELD NAME: OBSERVATION STOP CODE
         NODE,PIECE: [0,6]
        DESCRIPTION: This field contains the observation stop code which is
                     based on the treating specialty value of the record.
  
  
   b) The IN OUT PATIENT INDICATOR field (#7) of any extract file which 
      was a pointer to the LOCATION TYPE file (#40.9) has been converted 
      to a one character free text field.  This was done to accomodate the 
      "I" designation for Inpatient and "O" designation for Outpatient.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
   DSS Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been
   completed.  
     
   If you are running the install interactively and not rebuilding user 
   menus, installation will take less than 5 minutes. 
     
   Note:  If you are not running the installation interactively and intend
          to allow KIDS to start the rebuild of user menus upon completion
          of the install, then please queue the install for a period of
          low system activity.
     
   No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
   more than once.
     
   1.  Use the 'Load a Distribution' option within the KIDS 
       Installation menu to unload the KIDS distribution.
       The host file is named: ECX_30_P39.KID
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
      
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu. (Skip this step if already in the 
       Installation menu)
      
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*39):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
      
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*39.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
    
       Extract Manager's Options   [ECXMGR]
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
