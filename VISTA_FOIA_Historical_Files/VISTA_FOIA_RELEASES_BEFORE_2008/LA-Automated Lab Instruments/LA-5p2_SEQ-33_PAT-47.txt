 ========================================
  
 Patch Description: 
 This is the companion patch for LR*5.2*221. Full description of ALL
 enhancements are given in LR*5.2*221.  
   
 This patch support the ability to purge Automated Instrument data based on
  
 date range or inactivity range. This enhancement is to support Laboratory 
 Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) sites ability to purge automated
 instrument data based on user's supplied parameters.  
  
 The functionality of this patch is coupled with the features and function
 of patch LR*5.2*221. LA*5.2*47 is required for LR*5.2*221 installation.
 The functionality of the patch is expressed after patch LR*5.2*221 has
 been installed.
  
 ONLY THE ROUTINE 'LAGEN' IS CONTAINED IN THIS PATCH. All other LR*
 associated name spaced routines and options are contained in LR*5.2*221.
 The following options are transported and installed by LR*5.2*221.
  
 The 'Clear instrument/worklist data' [LRINSTCLR] option has been enhanced.
 The changes to this option implements selective clearing of instrument
 data from the ^LAH global. When entries are made in the ^LAH global to
 store instrument data pending verification, the date/time stamp of
 creation and result updating is now recorded. This date will be used to
 selectively remove data from the ^LAH global based on the date original
 result was received or last updated.
     If during the clearing process an entry in ^LAH global is found with
 no date/time in the creation/update field, the current date/time is
 entered into the entry. This entry is then eligible for clearing the next
 time the option is ran.
  
  
  The 'Clear instrument/worklist data' option will allow clearing by either
 of the following ways. Data received before the selected date (optional
 time) is purged. If you enter a date only then data received before that
 date is cleared. If you enter a date/time then data received before that
 date/time is cleared.
  
  Example:
 If you enter Sept 4, 1998 then data received through Sept 3, 1998 is
 cleared. If you enter Sept 4, 1998 @1200 then data through Sept 4, 1998 is
 cleared.
  
  The following routines support purge enhancement:
    LAGEN [LA*5.2*47]- Changes were made to set date/time of entry creation
 and last update. Last update can be different than creation date if data
 is retransmitted (overlay data = yes) or additional results received.
  
    LRLLS [LR*5.2*221]- Clear instrument data option that does actual
 clearing based on user's parameters. User can purge by date/time or
 blanket purge when using Clear instrument/worklist data [LRINSTCLR]
 option.
  
    LRVR1 [LR*5.2*221]-  Verifying routine with changes to setup date/time
 information when manual data entry is used during Enter/Verify Automated
 Instrument [LRVR] option.
  
    LRVRW [LR*5.2*221]-  Verifying routine with changes to setup date/time
 information when load/work list data entry is used during the Enter/verify
 data (Work list) [LRVRW] option.
  
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 Required Patch Installation List:
 LA*5.2*27
  
 This patch is compatible with OERR 2.5 and both versions of CPRS ,GUI and
 List Manager.
  
          1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan 
          menu. This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
          2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped,
          they should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
          3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global 
          on your system. You now need to use KIDS to install the 
          Transport global.
          
          On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
          following options:
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Backup a Transport Global
          4. Users may remain on the system, but installation 
             should be done during off peak hours and when the Laboratory 
             computer users are idle.
          5. No options need to be placed out of service.
          6. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off 
             peak hours, and less than 5 minutes during peak hours
             which is NOT RECOMMENDED.
          7. Installation of this patch does not require any additional 
             memory space.
          8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the 
             option 'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 
             'LA*5.2*47' and proceed with the install.
          9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
             should be returned to the mapped set once the 
             installation has run to completion.
