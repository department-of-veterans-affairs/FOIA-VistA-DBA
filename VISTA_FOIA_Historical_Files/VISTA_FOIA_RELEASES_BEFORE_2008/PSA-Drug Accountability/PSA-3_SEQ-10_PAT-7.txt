  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 1 minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan option.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3*7).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3*7.
  
  6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//' respond  NO.
   
  7. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
