 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. HD123062    Prosthetic Clerk's Menu [RMPR CLERK] option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Prosthetic Clerk's Menu [RMPR CLERK] option, the
    entry action determines the site by the clerk's information and doesn't
    allow the clerk various site accesses when using some options on the
    menu, such as reprint a Purchase Card transaction.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch will remove the entry action (which determines site of
    clerk) from the Prosthetic Clerk's Menu [RMPR CLERK] option using
    post-install routine RMPR115P.
  
    Note:  Routine RMPR115P's only purpose is to remove the entry action 
    from the RMPR CLERK menu as a post install routine in this patch. 
    This routine can be removed at the site's discretion.
  
  
 2. HD113108   Extra line feeds after Patch 90 for Purchase Order items
       Duplicates:  HD114578, HD116964, HD117281, HD123333
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There are 4 fields (Serial Number, Lot #, Model, Make) that can print
    after each item on a Purchase Order, and if they are not defined the
    line feeds occur anyway.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine RMPR4P22 to line feed ONLY when any of the 4 fields
    are defined.
  
 3. HD55304     Oxygen letters: site name wrapping into patient's 
                address  (NOIS: UNY-0702-13159)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When printing Oxygen letters the site name (erroneously) wrapping
    into the patient's name on next line.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routines RMPOLF0 and RMPOLF0A to print the Station ID as 
    do other letters, in lieu of site name.
