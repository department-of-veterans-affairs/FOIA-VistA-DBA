Subject: RPC to PUSH CMOR from MPI and Remote Sync of Data

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
  of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
  
  This patch is for the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
  (MPI/PD) Changes Iteration 2 project.
  
  Issue 1:  The MPI Data Quality Team has requested to be able to 
  remotely request a PUSH of CMOR.  A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) will
  be added to the local VistA system to support this request.  The 
  MPIF CMOR REQUEST (#984.9) file will be updated to include these
  requests for tracking purposes. Routine MPIFRCMP supports this effort.
  
  New Remote Procedure MPIF CMOR PUSH REMOTE will be added to the REMOTE
  PROCEDURE (#8994) file as part of this patch.
  
  Issue 2:  The MPI Data Quality Team has requested to be able to 
  send the CMOR's data to all of the other treating facilities
  in an effort to synchronize the 5 data fields between all the treating 
  facilites. [5 fields are Name (#.01), Social Security Number (#.09), Date
  of Birth (#.03), Sex (#.02), and Mother's Maiden Name (#.2403)]
  
  Two Protocols are being exported to support this effort - MPIF ADT-A31 
  CLIENT and MPIF ADT-A31 SERVER.  Both existed prior to this patch, they
  are being updated.
