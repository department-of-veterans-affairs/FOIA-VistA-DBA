Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Developed in DEV,VOO.
 
  This patch fixes a few minor problems with the Military Service Data
  Inconsistencies Report (DG MS INCONSISTENCIES RPT), and addresses the issues
  listed in the following NOISes:
 
   LAH-0504-60602     Unable to clear Merchant Seamen
   CLL-0504-40283     Military Service Data Inconsistencies Rep
   TAM-0504-30121     COMBAT DATES
   BAY-0404-32079     DG*5.3*562 - PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING REPORT
 
  Included functionality:
 
  1. The API that is used to determine Merchant Seaman service dates was
     incorrectly indicating a lack of necessary service, when in fact the
     service dates were correct.  This has been corrected with this release.
 
  2. A few spelling mistakes were corrected on the Inconsistencies Report.
 
  3. The Central Business Office has changed the following service date
     ranges:
 
      Conflict     Current From  New From    Current To   New To
      WWI          04/01/1917    04/06/1917  11/11/1918   no change
