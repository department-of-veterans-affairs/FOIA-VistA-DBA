Subject: DEBT NOT REFERRING TO TOP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one issue. The problem is that valid debts in  
 patient accounts are not referred to TOP (Treasury Offset Program) for
 collection when a repayment plan is established for one or more bills but 
 not all bills.
  
 Note: This patch must also be installed on all legacy systems.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HD64003/CPH-0604-41733     DEBT NOT REFERRING TO TOP
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Site lost revenue when valid debts in two patient accounts were not
    referred to TOP for collection because our software failed to process
    the additional eligibility of bills when each account had a bill on
    a repayment plan.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCTOPD to keep processing the additional eligibility
    of bills for sending a debt to TOP when any bill in the account on a
    repayment plan is found.
