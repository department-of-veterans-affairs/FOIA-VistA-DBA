Subject: PKI/DEA DIGITAL SIGNATURE FOR SCH II MEDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS;
        however, the functionality will remain dormant until
        implementation of the DEA/PKI Digital Signature project.
  
 DESCRIPTION:
 ============
 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group, in
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
 project, named Public Key Infrastructure for Electronic Prescriptions
 Pilot Project. The objective is to develop an electronic order entry
 system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital signatures. A
 Memorandum of Understanding between the DEA and the Department of
 Veterans Affairs authorizes only specified sites to use the full
 functionality of this pilot, although additional functionality is
 included that will benefit non-pilot sites. This patch contains the
 functionality required for this pilot and lays the foundations for the
 future implementation of the PKI once the DEA regulations are revised
 and published. It is installed with the PKI functionality disabled and
 will not have any impact until the PKI functionality is enabled. PKI
 functionality can be enabled via Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) parameters at a site level and a user level. Additional hardware
 and software is required from various sources before PKI can be
 implemented at a site. DO NOT enable the PKI parameters until all
 required software and hardware has been installed.
  
 To make this project viable, modifications to the following packages
 were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0  (This patch and XU*8*288)
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
  
 WEBSITES:
 =========
 Information on the PKI project can be found on the following Websites:

 DOCUMENTATION:
 ==============
 Documentation related to the PKI project is available at 
 the usual FTP sites, including an updated CPRS Technical
 Manual and user manual, describing the new functionality
 introduced by this patch.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
    download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP
 server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation 
 directly from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany
   ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines 
   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City
   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 Documentation files to get from the download sites include:
    HINESPKIUSERGUIDE.doc
      This is a word document to help in the installation and
      implementation of PKI for DEA/VA Schedule II drugs.
  
    CPRSGUITM.PDF, CPRSGUITM.DOC
      This is the CPRS GUI technical manual in both PDF and Word
      Document format.
  
    CPRSGUIUM.PDF, CPRSGUIUM.DOC
      This is the CPRS GUI user manual in both PDF and Word
      Document format.
  
    CERT_HOW_TOUPDATED11-5-02.PDF
      This is from a DEA contractor and shows how to view a DEA Cert.
  
    KRN8_OP283SP.PDF
      This documents the digital signature from the Kernel point of
      view during the development phase.
  
 RELATED PATCHES:
 ================
  Here is a list of the related patches for this project:
     PSN*4*65
     PSS*1*61
     PSO*7*131
     PSD*3*40
     XU*8*267
     XU*8*283
     XU*8*288
  
 IMPORTANT ITEMS:
 ===============
  1) Kernel patch XU*8*267 added a new field to the Institution file
  (#4), called FACILITY DEA NUMBER, which must have a value before this
  patch is installed.  Integrated sites, Multi-divisional sites and
  sites that have sub-stations that users are able to sign in to
  (clinics, nursing homes, etc.) must also have the Facility DEA Number
  entered for those sub-station entries in the Institution file (#4).
  
  2) If you install this patch without entering all the required
  Facility DEA Numbers, your physicians will not be able to order
  controlled substances.  You should be able to get the Facility
  DEA# from the Pharmacy or Pharmacy Chief.  With the Facility DEA#
  and your institution name, use VA FileMan to enter the data,
  as follows:
  
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: INSTITUTION//
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//    FACILITY DEA NUMBER
 THEN EDIT FIELD:
  
 Select INSTITUTION NAME: <Enter your institution name>
 FACILITY DEA NUMBER:     <Enter your Facility DEA# here>
  
  3) At this time, ONLY sites participating in the 
  DEA/PKI pilot should implement this functionality, which is done by 
  editing the following parameters.
  
  PARAMETERS:
  ORWOR PKI SITE - PKI Functionality Site Enabled
  This parameter may be set for a division or a system.  It is used to
  require digital signatures for schedule II and schedule IIn
  controlled substance for the division or system.  This parameter is
  set to yes when a site is ready to turn on PKI functionality for at
  least one user.
  
  ORWOR PKI USE - Allow PKI Functionality
  This parameter may be set for a user, a division or a system. 
  It is used to enable a user to enter digital signatures utilizing
  PKI technology.
  
  With these 2 parameters turned off, CPRS operates as it always has
  with respect to Schedule 2 meds.  Once these parameters are activated,
  users will see different functionality, depending on the environment
  they are working in (PKI Workstation, Non-PKI Workstation).
  
  Here are some of the expected scenarios:
  
  Parameter            OPT     Non-PKI     SCH
  -----------------------------------------------
  Site On/User On       X         X        2, 2n 
  
  Expected Outcome
  Site Parameter prevents electronic signing of CSII and CSIIn orders
  in Non-PKI environment (no card reader).  Presents message to user:
  
  ORDER NOT SENT TO PHARMACY
  This Schedule II medication cannot be electronically entered without
  a Digital Signature.
  Please cancel/discontinue this order and create a hand written order
  for manual processing, or digitally sign the order at a PKI-enabled
  workstation.
  
  Parameter            OPT        PKI        SCH
  -----------------------------------------------
  Site On/User On       X         X        2, 2n
  
  Expected Outcome
  Site Parameter prevents electronic signing of CSII and CSIIn orders
  in PKI environment (card reader).  Presents message to user:
  
  ORDER SENT TO PHARMACY upon correct identification of user and entry
  of a PIN number, which is given at the time of signing the order.
  
  OTHER FIXES
  ===========
  CPRS needs to allow inactive orderable items to be renewed for Medication
  Orders.  This was disabled with a recent patch and will be re-enabled
  with this patch.
