 This patch is available via FTP in a KIDS distribution file.  The Host 
 File is named ONC211P25.KID and is located in the [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]
 directory of the following CIO Field Offices:

 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
    
  1) MULTIDIVISIONAL CAPABILITY
     
     The Oncology package is now capable of supporting more than one division.
     
     a) Multiple ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETER (160.1) sets are now allowed.  Each
     division may have a unique set of site parameters.  Users in multi-
     divisional facilities who wish to maintain separate registries will
     need to create a separate site parameter set for each division.  This
     can be accomplished via the [TR Define Tumor Registry Parameters] option
     of the [UTL *..Utility Options ...] menu.
     
     b) Each primary in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file has been flagged as belonging
     to a particular division.  This has been done by means of the new DIVISION
     field (165.5,2000).
     
     Pre-existing primaries have been flagged with the current division value
     as part of the patch installation process.
     
     New primaries will be flagged with the creator's division as they are
     created.
     
     Whenever a primary is accessed, the primary's DIVISION value will be
     compared with the user's division value.  Only primaries that match
     the user's division value will be accessible.  Reports and other data
     displays will only display primaries that match the user's division.
     
     c) Patients in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file have NOT been flagged as
     belonging to a particular division.  They will be shared by all
     divisions with the following exception:
     
     Patients that are found via the casefinding options will be initially
     flagged as belonging to the finder's division.  Once the case has been
     taken off suspense and added to the registry, the flag will be removed.
     This temporary flagging will enable the users to print division
     specific suspense lists.
         
     The casefinding options will only look for cases which belong to the
     user's division and all affiliated divisions (see item d).  
     
     d) If a division is responsible for another division's cancer cases,
     this relationship should be recorded in the new ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS
     field AFFILIATED DIVISION (160.1,8).  This field is a multiple and will
     contain the division values for which the primary division is responsible.
     The casefinding options will search for cases which belong to the 
     user's division and all affiliated divisions.
     
     e) A new field, VISN (160.1,7) has been added to the ONCOLOGY SITE
     PARAMETERS file.  VISN has also been added to the NAACCR VACCR EXTRACT
     V7.0 format at columns 1031-1032.
     
     NOTE: For facilities that are not currently multidivisional these 
     multidivisional changes will be transparent. 
     
  2) NAACCR DATA STANDARDS AND DATA DICTIONARY RECORD LAYOUT VERSION 7
     
     Version 7 of the NAACCR record layout has been added.
     Versions 5.0 and 5.1 have been deleted.
     
  3) ACCESSION NUMBER (165.5,.05) EXPANSION
     
     As per the NAACCR Data Standards and Data Dictionary Record Layout
     Version 7, ACCESSION NUMBER has been expanded from 6 to 9 digits.
     The purpose of this expansion is to accomodate a 4-digit year as
     needed for the year 2000 and to accomodate very large institutions
     that accession more than 9,999 cases annually.  The existing ACCESSION
     NUMBER data will be converted to the new format.
     
  4) AUTHORIZED QA USER
     QA REVIEWER
     QA FINDINGS
     
     a) Due to a need for more than one AUTHORIZED QA USER, the field
        AUTHORIZED QA USER (160.1,4) has been replaced by the multiple
        AUTHORIZED QA USER (160.1,5).  The single entry field has been
        deleted and the data moved to the multiple.
     
     b) Two new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file:
     
        QA REVIEWER (165.5,64.1)
        QA FINDINGS (165.5,64.2) (word processing)
        
        These new fields follow the field QA DATE (165.5,64) in the QA portion
        of the abstract.
     
  5) PALATE, SOFT NOS (C05.1)
     
     The TNM staging logic for PALATE, SOFT NOS (C05.1) was incorrect.
     The nasopharynx TNM codes and automatic staging rules were being
     used.  The correct staging region for PALATE, SOFT NOS is oropharynx.
     
     This has been corrected.
     
  6) NEW ICDO MORPHOLOGY CODES
     
     The following codes have been added to the ICDO MORPHOLOGY file (164.1):
     
     2616/0  NASAL GLIAL HETEROTOPIA
     2650/0  RATHKE CLEFT CYST
     2663/0  NEUROGLIAL CYST (CHORISTOMA/PITUICYTOMA)
     2666/0  ENTEROGENOUS CYST
     3341/0  EPIDERMOID CYST
     3379/0  COLLOID CYST OF THE THIRD VENTRICLE
     4306/0  PLASMA CELL GRANULOMA
     5721/0  DIFFUSE MELANOSIS
     7550/0  HYPOTHALMIC NEURONAL HAMARTOMA
     8690/0  PARAGANGLIOMA OF THE FILUM TERMINALE
     
  7) REASON FOR NO SURGERY (165.5,58) STUFFING
     
     If the patient received any of the following surgical treatments,
     the application was stuffing REASON FOR NO SURGERY with 0 (Surgery
     performed).
     
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE      (165.5,58.2)
     SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY  (165.5,138) 
     SURGERY OF OTHER SITES/NODES (165.5,139) 
     SURG PRIMARY SITE @FACILITY  (165.5,50.2) 
     SCOPE OF LN SURG @FACILITY   (165.5,138.1) 
     SURG OTH SITE/NODE @FACILITY (165.5,139.1) 
     
     This was incorrect.
     
     REASON FOR NO SURGERY will now be stuffed with 0 (Surgery performed)
     only if the patient has received SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE or SURG PRIMARY
     SITE @FACILITY.
     
  8) 1998 PCE STUDY OF CANCER OF THE PROSTATE
 
     a) ITEM 52. INTERSTITIAL RADIATION/BRACHYTHERAPY ADMINISTERED
     If the RADIATION (165.5,51.2) value was 0 (None), the application was
     stuffing the following fields with 8.  This was incorrect.  The correct
     value to be stuffed is 0 (No).  Any values of 8 have been converted to
     0-No.
 
     GOLD 198                (165.5,628)
     IODINE 125              (165.5,627)
     IRIDIUM 192             (165.5,630)
     PALLADIUM 103           (165.5,629)
     OTHER INTERSTITIAL, NOS (165.5,631)
 
     b) ITEM 54. EXTERNAL RADIATION ADMINISTERED
     The following fields contained the codes: 1-Yes; 2-No; 9-Unknown.
     The correct codes are: 0-No, region/site not targeted; 1-Yes; 8-NA,
     external radiation not administered; 9-Unknown.  Any values of 2-No
     have been converted to 0-No, region/site not targeted.
 
     DISTANT METASTATIC SITES      (165.5,636)
     PROSTATE AND PELVIC NODES     (165.5,634)
     PROSTATE & PELVIC PARA-AORTIC (165.5,635)
     PROSTATE REGION ONLY          (165.5,633)
     OTHER EXTERNAL SITES, NOS     (165.5,637) 
 
  9) RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE (165.5,51.3) STUFFING
     
     If the DATE OF NO TREATMENT (165.5,124) field is set, the application
     stuffs all treatment fields with the appropriate value indicating no
     treatment.  However, the RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE field was not being
     stuffed.  It will now be stuffed with the value '0  No rad and/or surg'.

 Installation instructions:
 ==========================
    
 1) This patch is being distributed as a KIDS Host File:
    
    ONC211P25.KID
    
 2) This patch should be installed when the ONCOLOGY users are off the 
    system.
    
 3) There are no patch dependencies associated with this patch.  If the
    routines in this patch are mapped at your site, remember to disable
    mapping before installing the patch and to re-enable it when you are
    finished.
    
 4) The routines included in this patch should be installed in the
    production UCI.
    
 5) When the patch is first installed you may see the following display:
    
     160.3   PRIMARY PAYER AT DIAGNOSIS
     *BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE 'PRIMARY PAYOR AT DIAGNOSIS' AS FILE #160.3!
     Shall I write over your PRIMARY PAYOR AT DIAGNOSIS File? YES//
    
    Answer "YES" to this prompt.
    
 6) Recommended responses to the following installation questions:
  
    Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES
  
    NOTE: If you are installing multiple patches, more than one of which
    requires Menu Tree rebuilding, you may wish to defer rebuilding until
    the completion of the last patch.  In this way, you will only rebuild
    the Menu Trees once.
  
    Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO 
  
    Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
  
 7) This patch will take approximately 10 minutes to install.  Only Oncology
    users need to be off the system.  The ONCOLOGY options do not need to be
    disabled during the installation of this patch.  Your customer support
    representative will answer any questions regarding this patch.
