Description: 
============

 NOTE: Patch PSB*2*12 makes changes to the ward-specific IV Parameters 
 functionality included in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application.  Please 
 be sure to read the Problem and Corrective Action statements below and 
 coordinate the installation of this patch appropriately before installing 
 it. (See suggestion at bottom of Corrective Action please.)
 
 1.  Problem: The GUI BCMA Site Parameters application, IV Parameters 
     settings for specific wards did not function as required.  The IV Parameter 
     settings for the "ALL" ward always affected the display of a patient's IV 
     bags on the Virtual Due List (VDL), regardless of the settings for the 
     patient's respective ward. 
 
     Corrective Action: The IV Parameters settings for the "ALL" ward affect 
     the display of a patient's IV bags VDL only when the settings are not 
     defined for the patient's respective ward. Please be aware that after 
     you install this patch, all ward-specific IV Parameters defined for 
     wards other than "ALL" will work immediately. These parameters control 
     when an IV bag is valid, and when BCMA warns a user the status of an 
     IV order has changed.  
     
     If your site has defined ward-specific IV Parameters, please review them 
     BEFORE installing this patch, and notify the appropriate personnel to 
     ensure that problems are not experienced once installed.
 
 
 2.  Problem: The PSB DEFAULT BARCODE PREFIX Site Parameter was set to 
     accept 1 to 5 characters so the user had to specify a prefix in the 
     GUI Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Site Parameters application. 
     If none was specified, the barcode number was not recognized when the 
     user scanned a patient's medication for administration.
  
     Corrective Action: The PSB DEFAULT BARCODE PREFIX Site Parameter has 
     been set to accept 0 to 5 characters, so the user does not need to specify 
     a prefix in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. When a barcode is 
     printed, no prefix is added to the barcode so the label scans successfully 
     during medication administration.
 
 3.  Problem: Changes made to the IV Parameters when using the GUI BCMA 
     Site Parameters application were not always being saved for the selected 
     division.
  
     Corrective Action: Changes made to the IV Parameters when using the 
     GUI BCMA Site Parameters application are now being saved for the selected 
     division.
  
 4.  Problem: When the unit of administration is a patch and that patch has 
     a "Given" status, the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) displayed the last action 
     date/time of the order in the "Last Action" column.  The VDL did not 
     display the last action date/time of the orderable item.
 
     Corrective Action: When the unit of administration is a patch and the 
     patch has a "Given" status, the BCMA VDL displays in the "Last Action" 
     column the last action date/time of the orderable item.
 
 5.  Problem: Text in the "U/Gvn" column of the BCMA Medication Log Report 
     did not provide word wrapping. This became apparent after free-text 
     'quantity and units' data was entered during the administration of a 
     medication dose.
  
     Corrective Action: After entering free-text 'quantity and units' data 
     during the administration of a medication dose, information in the "U/Gvn" 
     column of the BCMA Medication Log Report will appropriately word wrap.
  
 6.  Problem: The following is an example of an error that occurred when a 
     user attempted to administer a unit dose medication with an "IV Push"
     med route:
 
      "^Error(s) Filing Transaction MEDPASS
       Data Validation Error: 701: The value 'KCL 20MEQ/D5/NACL {2}' 
       for field UNIT OF ADMINISTRATION in SOLUTIONS SUB-FIELD in file BCMA 
       MEDICATION LOG is not valid."
 
     The above error occurred under particular conditions associated with the 
     IV solution. 
  
     Corrective Action: The user is able to administer unit dose medications 
     with an "IV push" medication route, regardless of the IV solution.
 
 7.  Problem: The free text data that is entered in the "Enter Quantity and
     Units" dialogue box, for a medication order with multiple dispense
     drugs, display twice under the "U/Gvn" column of the BCMA Medication
     Log Report.
  
     Corrective Action: The free text data will only display once under the
     "U/Gvn" column of the BCMA Medication Log Report.
