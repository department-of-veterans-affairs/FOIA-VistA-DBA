Subject: CLOZAPINE DISCONTINUES AND RACE/ETHNICITY UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  The Clozapine reporting software will automatically discontinue a 
 patient if the patient's prescription is over 28 days old.  This prevents 
 a patient from being issued medication on an expired prescription.  The 
 Clozapine protocol requires a new prescription each time the medication 
 is dispensed.  Clozapine patients are being discontinued whose 
 prescriptions are current.  This happens when the roll-up occurs between 
 the time when the prescription is entered into the system and when it is 
 dispensed.  This patch will prevent the patient from being discontinued 
 until the prescription is 28 days past the fill date.
  
  Clozapine data is transmitted to the field offices in Hines and Dallas.  
 The domain names have been changed from ISC-DALLAS.VA.GOV and 
 ISC-CHICAGO.VA.GOV to FO-DALLAS.MED.VA.GOV and FO-HINES.MED.VA.GOV.
  
 THIS PATCH WILL REPORT THE NEW RACE AND ETHNICITY ENTRIES TO THE NATIONAL 
 CLOZAPINE DATABASE.
  
 INSTALLATION TIME FRAME : VA DIRECTIVE 2001-023 REQUIRES INSTALLATION OF 
 THIS PATCH WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE TIME OF INITIAL RELEASE.

 Reference NOIS:   COA-0901-21209     CLOZAPINE PATIENTS INACTIVATED
                        I've been informed by Pharmacy service that we
                        continue to have Clozapine patients being
                        automatically inactivated (details can be
                        provided). We have previously worked with
                        Stephanie Todd from Dallas on specific problems,
                        however, NOIS BAC-0701-40194 notes in response
                        #22 that a patch is forthcoming.
  
                   BAC-0701-40194     Random inactivation of clozapine
                                      pts
                        Our pharmacy ADPAC has been reporting for awhile
                        about Clozapine patients being inactivated.
                        I initially held off reporting this via NOIS
                        because I knew that PSO*7*56 was going to
                        address these problem previously reported by
                        other sites. We installed it in March, but it's
                        happened again randomly.  This time I had the
                        adpac report the patients name to me so that I
                        can begin to look at it.
  
                   BHS-0302-12595     Cloz trans failed
                   MAD-0402-41028     Clozapine transmission failed
                        Both NOIS calls report an undefined error during
                        data transmission.  The reporting mechanism has
                        been modified to prevent this error.
                   UNY-0402-11524     CLOZARIL PATIENTS STILL BEING
                                      INACTIVATED
                        I still have complaints of patients being
                        inactivated for some reason and the pharmacy
                        needs to activate each time before entering
                        clozaril scripts.  The local site has contacted
                        the NCCC and they just tell them to re-activate
                        and there is nothing wrong on their end.

          Installation Instructions:
          ==========================
  
   NOTE: This KIDS install does not place any options out of service
         during the install and no user options are affected.
  
         The site should answer "NO" to all three questions.
             Note: You may not receive all three prompts at your site.
  
         "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
          Install? YES// NO"
  
         "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO"
  
         "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

          1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
             This option will load the KIDS package in this message onto
             your system.
  
          2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they
             should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
          3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on
             your system. You now need to use KIDS to install the
             Transport global.
  
             On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
             following options:

                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Backup a Transport Global
  
          4. Users may remain on the system, installation may be done at
             any time except during the time scheduled for the Clozapine
             roll-up.
  
          5. No options need to be placed out of service.
  
          6. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off peak
             hours and less than 5 minutes during peak hours.
  
          7. Installation of this patch requires no additional memory
             space.
  
          8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the
             option:
             'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*74 and
             proceed with the install.
  
          9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they
             should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
             has run to completion.
