Subject: TIU STANDARDIZATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 In the post-init routine this patch will add data for the TIU (Text
 Integration Utilities) Domain to the HDIS Domain file (#7115.1). It will
 also add data for the File/Fields being standardized for TIU to the HDIS
 File/Field file (#7115.6) and File/Field multiple in the HDIS Domain file
 (#7115.1).  These entries are being added to the files for VHA Unique
 Identifier (VUID) Seeding which is part of standardizing the TIU files
 associated with the TIU Domain. This patch will also add the TIU Set of
 Codes fields and their associated VUID(s) to the XTID VUID FOR SET OF
 CODES file (#8985.1) in the post-init routine. This data is also part of
 the Domain standardization process.  Patch TIU*1*211 will actually invoke
 the standardization VUID Seeding.  This patch is just in preparation for
 the TIU patch.
