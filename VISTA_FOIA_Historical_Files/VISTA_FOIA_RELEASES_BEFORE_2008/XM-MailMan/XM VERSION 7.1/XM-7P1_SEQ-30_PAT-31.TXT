Description: 
============

  MailMan Patch XM*7.1*31
  
  NOIS: BRX-0496-11847     Routines: ^XMA5,^XMA5A
   Fixes subscript error when  QD'ing numeric recipients, such as those
   @AOL.COM
  
  NOIS: DAY-0995-40521     Routines: ^XMA21
   Removes phantom recipients when using XMY array during programmer calls
   to ^XMB(bulletin) or ^XMD(message).
  
  NOIS: NAS-1295-30255     Routines: ^XMB1
        CLE-0396-41473
   Later'd messages report will now appear even if ^'d out of prior option.
  
  NOIS: BRX-0396-10222     Routines: ^XMAD2
        MAD-0196-40136
        MCM-0896-50571
   Fixes error caused by Later'd messages becoming new after the user has
   been deactivated and deleted from ^XMB(3.7.
  
  NOIS: TOM-1195-41441     Routines: ^XMA21
   Sender doesn't have to broadcast twice when forwarding.
  
  NOIS: CMO-1195-40423     Routines: ^XMA24
   Lets sender deselect ('-*') broadcast.
  
  NOIS: FTM-1195-41507     Routines: ^XMA24
   Ask sender for basket when sending to SHARED,MAIL, whether or not "ask
   basket" is set to "yes".
  
  NOIS: GRJ-1094-50087      Routines: ^XMA21G
   Make error message clearer by changing from "not found" to "mail group
   not found".
  
  NOIS: none                Routines: ^XMA21,^XMA210
   No Nois, refer to FORUM mail msg 19872177.
   If user enters a number in response to 'send to:' prompt, and the DUZ is
   not found in ^VA(200, MailMan will no longer try to use the number as an
   IEN to pick out a mail name or remote user.
  
  NOIS: MWV-0396-21324      Routines: ^XMA21,^XMA21G
   This concerns what happens when a user deselects an addressee (-name or
   -g.group) at a 'send to:' prompt, after already broadcasting ('*').
   If "-g.group", MailMan lets the user know that the message will still go
   to all local users.
   If "-name", MailMan checks to see if the "name" is already specified as a
   recipient.  If he is, then MailMan tells the user that the message will still
   go to all local users.  If he isn't, then MailMan just tells the user that
   "name" is not found.
  
  E3R: 8885                 Routines: ^XMA21
   Removes all SSN cross-references from the lookup at the 'Send to:' prompt. 
   This ensures that if the user enters a number, it cannot partial match  (and
   display) an SSN.  Lookup on the ^VA(200 is now confined to the following
   cross references:  NAME(B), ALIAS(BB), INITIAL(C), NICK NAME(D) 
  
  NOIS: ALB-0596-50002      Routines: ^XMRENT
   Prevents an error from occuring when the SENDER field (piece 4) of a message
   is zero.
  
  NOIS: DAY-1096-41059      Routines: ^XMGAPI0
   If a message subject is longer than 65 characters, it is truncated to the
   first 250 characters.
  
  NOIS: ANN-1096-41381      Routines: ^XMRPCTS0
   Check to make sure a task is running, rather than just assuming it is.
  
  NOIS: WPB-0894-30125      Routine: ^XMA1
   The default message action for a message which is NEWed is IGNORE, even if
   the site or the user has specified that the default message action is
   DELETE.  If a user deletes a message after NEWing it, the message will be
   deleted.  The default is changed only for the duration of your actions on
   that particular message.  When you get to the next message, your default is
   whatever it is supposed to be. 
  ===========================================================================
  
   This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
   minimum.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order.
  ===========================================================================
   
  INSTALLATION:
    1.  This routine is usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routine.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s)
    5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
