Subject: NPI Extract Data

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 WARNING: Due to potential negative impact on you're revenue, it is highly 
 recommended that patch PSO*7*254 be installed prior to this patch.
   
 Kernel patch, XU*8.0*438 is for the NPI Extract. NPI numbers and associated
 demographics will be pulled from the Institution File (#4), the New Person
 file (#200), and the non VA facilities file (#355.93) from each VA Medical
 Center.  The extracted data will be aggregated and moved to a secure data-
 base that can be accessed by the CBO.  The extracted data will be formatted
 into an encrypted and password protected Excel spreadsheet and sent to the
 payers via a CD.  This Excel data file can then be loaded into the NPI
 Crosswalk file at every payer, thus enabling them to crosswalk the new NPI
 to a provider's legacy payer ID.
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
  
 After this patch is installed, the IRM will need to schedule option XUS
 NPI EXTRACT through TaskMan to run ONCE and after that as requested by CBO.

 with an NPI and forwards an email containing those records to a pre-
 determined email address.
  
 Note: Assistance from a system manager may be required to schedule this
 option.
  
  1.      From the TaskMan Management menu, select Schedule/Unschedule
          Options.
