Associated patches: (v)MPIF*1*30   <<= must be installed BEFORE `MPIF*1*34'

Subject: CMOR CHANGE REQUEST AND INSTITUTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master
  of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities, or Subscribers.
  
  Issue 1:  Kernel patch XU*8.0*261 will be creating several new entries
  in the INSTITUTION (#4) file where the NAME (#.01) field can begin with
  numerics (e.g., for Department of Defense (DOD) entries).  These numbers
  could match an existing station number for a VistA facility.  This will
  cause problems in the MPIF CMOR REQUEST (#984.9) file for fields SITE
  (#.07) and CMOR AFTER APPROVAL (#.09) when the fields are populated by
  passing in the station number.  Patch MPIF*1.0*34 will change station
  number to the internal entry number (IEN) for that INSTITUTION entry to
  avoid any problems.  Routines involved are: MPIFREQ and MPIFEDIT.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*34.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following option:
  
          Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) Request  [MPIF CMOR MGR]
  
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
