Description:
============

  
 ***********************************************************************
  
 NOTE: This patch (PSB*3.0*15) should be installed IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
 INSTALLATION OF PATCH PSB*3.0*9.
  
 ***********************************************************************
  
  
  
  
  
  1.  Problem: HD000000088329
      The Medication Order Button (MOB) within the Graphical User
      Interface, Bar Code Medication Administration system (BCMA)
      malfunctions after the installation of patch PSB*3*9.  When the
      BCMA MOB is used to administer medications and create orders, 
      all data is stored and maintained properly.  The malfunction
      occurs when the post PSB*3*9, BCMA system frees memory after
      all administration and order processing has occurred and BCMA
      begins to free memory per MOB activity.  Because a variable
      needed by BCMA MOB exit activities has been cleared, BCMA generates
      the "<UNDEFINED>MOBR+25^PSBAPIPM" before processing has completed.
  
  
      Corrective Action:
      PSB*3*15 will allow BCMA MOB exiting processing to complete
      without error.
