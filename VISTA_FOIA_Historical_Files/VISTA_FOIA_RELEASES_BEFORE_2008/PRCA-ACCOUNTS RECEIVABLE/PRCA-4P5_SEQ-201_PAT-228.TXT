Description:
============

 Interface Overview
 ------------------
 In September 2004, patches, PRCA*4.5*201 and IB*2.0*233, implemented the
 design requirements for a software development project where the Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) established a new set of revenue metrics
 for use in monitoring the performance of the VHA revenue cycle at all VHA
 facilities.  The desired metrics are industry-standard measures that are
 commonly used in other public and private health care institutions.  An 
 existing VHA centralized data warehouse is used to calculate these metrics
 and provides results via a web-based performance metric site.  This data
 warehouse is updated on a monthly basis.
  
 VHA's Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified the daily collection of 
 this data as a high priority to support the metrics development process.  
 CBO needs the daily collection of data to populate the centralized data 
 warehouse with billing and collections transactions from each VHA facility.
 The calculated metrics would be viewable to field and headquarters staff 
 through an existing website.  An automated daily VistA extract would 
 provide more timely and accurate data to this centralized data warehouse.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 This patch adds additional fields to the existing transmission, and is 
 Part 1 of Phase 2 of the implementation.  Another patch will be issued 
 later this year adding more fields to the transmission and several new
 extracts.
  
 This patch adds the following items to the transmission:

 Other Changes:
 -------------- 
 o       Functionality has been added to screen out test patients from the 
         information being transmitted in the data extracts.
  
 o       The header of the AR Batch Payment (#344) line has been modified 
         to display the number of rows transmitted.
  
 o       This patch adds a new batch type to the BATCH TYPE field (#.04) 
         of the AR DATA QUEUE file (# 348.4). The CBO FISCAL YR 2005 
         transmissions will be sent with a batch type of "E".
  
 o       This patch also corrects problems with the first release of this 
         software (PRCA*4.5*201).   These issues include Remedy Ticket 
         #HD85294, a flaw which stopped some of the CPT codes from being 
         transmitted, the transmission of internal numbers rather than 
         external values for procedures in line 399.0402, flaws in the 
         original patch that prevented all the transactions from 433 (AR 
         Transaction file) from transmitting, and the use of direct global
         references.
   
  
 ************************* SPECIAL NOTES *************************
 *****************************************************************
  
 Test Accounts
 -------------
 As with the previous patch, if this patch is installed in a test 
 account, data will begin to be accumulated and the historical extracts 
 will be setup to run in the test account's TaskMan and sent to the 
 Allocation Resource Center (ARC).  The ability to turn this functionality 
 off ONLY in the test account has been provided.  It can be turned off and 
 on as needed for testing purposes.  Turning this functionality off, turns 
 off both the capture of data into the AR DATA QUEUE file (#348.4) and the 
 transmission of batches.  Batches created from a test account are ftp'd 
 to a separate account at the ARC.
  
  
 Report
 ------
 A print and sort template were provided in patch, PRCA*4.5*201, to be used
 as a validation of active and suspended bills.  This report needs to be 
 queued upon installation of this patch.  This report then needs to be sent
 to April Zaidel and Carolyn Pomicter in FORUM.
  
 An example of running this report is given below:

 Post-Installation Notes
 -----------------------
 In the post-installation process, a task will be queued to send a 
 FTP file of all active and suspended bills to the ARC.  This task 
 will be queued for 8pm on the date of installation.  Also, multiple
 background jobs will be automatically created to send back data from the
 date of the installation of patch PRCA*4.5*201. There will be a series of
 9 transmissions sent.  The description for these jobs will be CBO FISCAL
 YR 2005 for the 1st 5 transmissions and CBO FISCAL YR 2004 for the final 4
 transmissions.
  
 All jobs are queued for a Saturday at 6:00 am.  The first job will
 be queued to start the first Saturday after installation and subsequent
 jobs will be queued for the next 3 Saturdays.  The 5th transmission 
 will be sent on the Sunday after the 4th Saturday at 6:00 am.
  
 The FY05 tasks set up by the post-init are:
  
 First task is for Date of installation of PRCA*4.5*201 thru 9/27/2004
 Second is for 9/28/2004-12/31/2004
 Third is for 1/1/2005-3/31/2005
 Fourth is for 4/1/2005-6/30/2005
 Fifth is for 7/1/2005-Installation date of this patch
  
 There will also be four transmissions of FY 04 data set up in the task 
 manager.  These will begin on the Saturday following the fifth FY05 
 transmission and subsequent jobs will be queued for the next 3 Saturdays.
  
 The FY04 tasks set up by the post-init are:
  
 First task is for 9/26/2003-12/31/2003
 Second is for 1/1/2004-3/31/2004
 Third is for 4/1/2004-6/30/2004
 Fourth is for 7/1/2004-One day before the Date of installation of 
 PRCA*4.5*201
  
 NOTE:  If the scheduled times for these historical extracts are 
 inconvenient, they may be 'requeued' via the 'Requeue Tasks' option in 
 TaskMan.  The time frame chosen (Saturdays/ Sunday at 6:00am) was picked
 to lessen impact on your VistA system.

 The ARC was not getting all the transactions from file 433. There are 4
 changes made in this patch to correct the problem:
  
 1. Change the Transaction Date to Date Entered rather than Transaction 
 Date.
 2. Change the CBO EXTRACT FLAG to allow OPEN status bills to be processed.
 3. Change the software to allow the sending of data on the CCPC extract 
 date.
 4. Add a MUMPS Cross-reference to file 433 (AR Transaction file), field 
    12 (Transaction type).

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please be sure to note and follow the Pre-Installation and Post-
 Installations.  The Pre-Installation Instructions discuss making sure
 the PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS is NOT running while installing this patch.
 The Post-Installation Instructions deal with running the report detailed
 in the SPECIAL NOTES section and discussed in the Post-Installation Notes
 section.  This report must be queued to run after business hours the same 
 day as the installation of the patch.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 It is recommended that the following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) 
 file and all of their descendants be disabled to prevent possible 
 conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be 
 affected.
  
 ****All IB*, PRCA*, and RC* options should be disabled during 
 installation of the patch****
  
  
 Installation of this patch is mandatory at all sites, including the 
 legacy systems, if the legacy system still has "active" or outstanding 
 bills in AR.
  
 This patch should be installed after normal business hours, when all 
 Accounts Receivable Users are logged off the system.
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes in the foreground depending upon the 
 size of the Task file.  It is recommended that this install NOT be queued 
 but run in the foreground.
  
 ******************** PRE-INSTALLATION INTRUCTIONS ********************
  
 Ensure the PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS is NOT running while installing this 
 patch.  TaskMan should be used to verify that the PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS
