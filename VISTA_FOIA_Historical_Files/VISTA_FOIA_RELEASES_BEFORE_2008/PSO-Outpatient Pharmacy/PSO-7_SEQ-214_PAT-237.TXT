Subject: CORRECT CLOZAPINE OVERRIDE DURING RENEWAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will make two corrections to the Outpatient Pharmacy package.
 The first change will be to prevent new outpatient orders from being
 placed on the Clozapine Override List inadvertently.  The second, Patient
 Safety Issue PSI-06-016, will prevent Pending orders that have been on
 file for a year or more from being Finished.
  
  
 Associated Remedy:
 =================
 HD119007 -   Clozapine override list errors
 HD125383  -  Old orders being finished in Outpatient
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ========== 
 New Jersey VAMC
 Durham VAMC
 S. Arizona HCS
  
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. HD119007 -   Clozapine override list errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When executing menu option PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS, Patient Prescription
 Processing, the user mistakenly chose to Renew (RN) a clozapine order.  
 The current directive does not allow for Renewal of clozapine orders,
 therefore this is not an acceptable practice.  The system then issued a
 warning and prompt similar to below:
  
     *** No results for NEW WBC in past 6 days CANNOT fill ***
  
     Do you want to override and issue this prescription? N// YES
  
 YES is selected to override this warning and to issue the prescription.  
 Immediately after this renewal order, a New Order (NO) for an unrelated
 drug is issued.  Under these unusual circumstances the new order is 
 flagged and placed on the Clozapine override list and the renewal order
 involving the Clozapine drug was not put on that list as it should have
 been.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct code that handles the renewal process to add the renewed order, 
 where the override prompt was answered, and then cleanup the variable 
 ANQDATA so this won't carry over to the next order inadvertently.
  
  
 2. HD125383  -  Old orders being finished in Outpatient
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patient Safety Issue: PSI-06-016
  
 Old Pending orders that remain on the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file 
 (#52.41) for a year or more are being allowed to be finished and a label 
 printed.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Upon trying to execute the Finish (FN) operation, in option PSO LM
 BACKDOOR ORDERS, the user will be returned to the Medication Profile
 Screen and the bell will sound and an error message similar to the one
 below will be displayed.
  
        Order is older than 365 days and can't be finished
