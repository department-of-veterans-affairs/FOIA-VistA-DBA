Category:

     Problem:
     --------
     When the PRCA Nightly Process runs, the work assignment list is 
     built and a mailman message, Subject:  AR Supervisor List for (date),
     is generated for each user who holds the IBJD WORKLOAD ASSIGNMENT 
     key.  A separate, unique mailman message is generated for each 
     recipient even though the content of the messages is identical.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     This patch corrects the code so that only 1 mailman message is
     generated for all recipients who hold the IBJD WORKLOAD ASSIGNMENT
     key.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 =========
 Routine RCDMBWL2 has been modified to only generate 1 mailman message
 for all of the recipients who hold the IBJD WORKLOAD ASSIGNMENT key.
