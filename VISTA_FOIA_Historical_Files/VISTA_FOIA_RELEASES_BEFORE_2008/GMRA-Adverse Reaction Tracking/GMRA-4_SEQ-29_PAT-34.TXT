Associated patches: (v)GMRA*4*23   <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRA*4*34'

Subject: Update to HL7 messages

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 In patch GMRA*4*23, routines were distributed to send HL7 messages
 containing allergy data to the Health Data Repository (HDR).
  
 This patch adds a check for HL7 control characters that are embedded in
 text type data elements in the HL7 message and converts these control
 characters to the correct HL7 Escape Sequence.
  
 **NOTE** You must suspend the VDEF Request Queue before installing this
 patch and then re-enable it after installation of the patch.  The steps
 for doing that are outlined in the installation instructions.
  
 **NOTE** There are three emergency patches all being released on the same
 day (PSO*7*235, GMRA*4*34, and GMRV*5*17), that all require the suspension
 and the re-enabling of the VDEF Request Queue during patch installation.
 Please coordinate the patch installation activities of these three 
 patches. Keep in mind that the suspension of the VDEF Request Queue 
 suspends all VDEF messages from all applications that send messages 
 through the VDEF.

 INSTALLATION
 ============
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 1 minute
 to install.
  
 **NOTE** The routine being changed sends data to the HDR.  You MUST stop 
 the VDEF request queue BEFORE installing this patch.  The steps to do 
 this are outlined in step 1 below.  AFTER installing this patch you must 
 enable the VDEF request queue by following the instructions in step 11.
  
 **NOTE** There are three emergency patches all being released on the same
 day (PSO*7*235, GMRA*4*34, and GMRV*5*17), that all require the suspension
 and the re-enabling of the VDEF Request Queue during patch installation.
 Please coordinate the patch installation activities of these three 
 patches. Keep in mind that the suspension of the VDEF Request Queue 
 suspends all VDEF messages from all applications that send messages 
 through the VDEF.
  
 1. Stop VDEF request queue.  Use option VDEF CONFIGURATION MENU
  
    Select VDEF Configuration and Status Option: ?
  
     Site   Site-Wide Parameters
     Req    Request Queue Parameters
     ActR   Activate/Inactivate Requestor
     SusR   Suspend/Run Request Queue
     Cust   VDEF Custodial Package Activate/Inactivate
     API    VDEF Event API Activate/Inactivate
     Stat   Status of VDEF components
     Sch    Request Processor Schedule
  
     Select VDEF Configuration and Status Option: SUSR  Suspend/Run
     Request Queue
  
     Select Request Queue: MAINTENANCE
     SUSPENDED FLAG: RUNNING// SUSPEND
  
 2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 3.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*34):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRA*4.0*34.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     you may respond NO.
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
 10. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 11. After the patch is installed you must enable the VDEF request queue.  
     Using the same menu option as outlined in step 1, change the 
     SUSPENDED FLAG from SUSPENDED to RUN.
