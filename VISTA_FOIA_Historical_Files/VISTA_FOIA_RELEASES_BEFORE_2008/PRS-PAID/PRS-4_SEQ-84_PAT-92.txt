Subject: UPDATES TO DECOMP FOR PL 108-170

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 On December 6, 2003, the President signed into law S. 1156 becoming P.L.
 108-170.  Section 303 of the bill modifies 38 USC 7454(b) to provide
 Saturday premium pay for certain "health care professionals".  These
 employees must now receive Saturday premium pay under title 38 rules. This
 amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect with respect to the
 first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004.
  
 Due to the extremely short time between the signing of the Public Law, and
 its desired implementation date, there wasn't enough time to add all of
 the necessary changes in a single patch.
  
 Patch PRS*4.0*90 added the 4 new Premium Pay Indicators to the PAID
 ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file and updated the decomposition portion of the
 software to handle the majority of the rule changes.
  
 Patch PRS*4.0*92 will update the VistA PAID/ETA software to handle the
 additional business rules added by this new Public Law, and to update the 
 8B edit checks as necessary to accommodate the new Pay Plan/Premium Pay 
 Indicator combinations.
  
 MP-6 Part V Supp. 2.2 contains the rules related to the payment of 
 Saturday Premium.
  
  
 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR TIMEKEEPERS
 ====================================
 Certain GS employees are now entitled to Saturday premium pay.  These are
 mostly GS employees who provide direct health care.  If you do not know
 if your employees are entitled to this, you may call your Payroll
 Technician.
  
 If the employee is full or part time, and has a tour of duty on Saturday,
 the system will pay the Saturday premium pay without any additional
 coding from the timekeepers.  If the employees are working beyond their
 normal tour, special codes have to be entered in the remarks section
 IF THE EMPLOYEE IS TO RECEIVE SATURDAY PREMIUM.
  
  
 FULL TIME EMPLOYEES
 ------------------- 
 For FT employees working OT on Saturday, a determination must be made if
 Saturday Pay is applicable.  To receive Saturday premium pay for OT, the
 employee must be working the OT which falls on a regular tour of duty for
 Saturday.  In other words, there must be tours being worked on Saturday,
 and the FT employee has been asked to work OT during one of these tours.
  
 If there are no tours scheduled for Saturday, the employee cannot be
 paid Saturday premium for working OT.
  
 REMEMBER!  All OT does not need a remarks code.  The only time you need
 to add a remarks code when posting OT is when you want the system to pay
 more money than just the OT.  Once the decision is made that additional
 pay is needed, one of the following codes must be entered in the remarks
 section after entering the OT.
  
 CODE            NAME                    YIELD
 ----            ----                    -----
  9              OT/CT ON PREMIUM T&L    SAT PREM/NO ND
 11              PRE-SCHEDULED           ND
 12              TOUR COVERAGE           SAT + ND
 13              CALL BACK NON-PREMIUM   TWO HOUR OT MIN
 14              CALL BACK PREMIUM       TWO HOUR OT MIN + SAT PREM
  
  
 PART TIME
 --------- 
 If the part time employee is covered under this new law, they will
 receive Saturday premium pay automatically when working a tour of duty on
 Saturday.  No action is needed from the timekeeper.  If the part time
 employee is working unscheduled hours on Saturday, the same rules that are
 outlined above for full time employees apply in determining if the
 employee should receive Saturday premium, and the same codes are to be
 used as applicable.
  
  
 INTERMITTENT
 ------------ 
 The intermittent employees have the biggest change.  Seeing as they do
 not have a "tour of duty", the system will NOT PAY SATURDAY PREMIUM
 WITHOUT A REMARKS CODE!  Very important!  If the employee works on
 Saturday, and no remarks code is entered, the employee will only receive
 their normal pay for the hours posted.
  
 If a determination is made that the employee is entitled to Saturday
 premium, (working on a tour established for the T&L), then a code 9 must
 be entered in the remarks field.  No code will pay the employee only the
 time worked.  Never should a code 9 be entered in all circumstances.  A
 careful review must be made each time to determine if the employee is
 entitled or not.
  
 ALL SATURDAY TIME WORKED BY GS EMPLOYEES NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED TO 
 DETERMINE IF ANY OF IT WILL REQUIRE A PREMIUM PAY CODE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE
 SATURDAY PREMIUM PAY.

 1. FGH-0204-30635  Timecards rejecting due to standby pay code 
 2. MSC-0204-41796  Problems editing part time and intermittent employees
  
 Problem:  
 --------
 Several of the 8B edit checks needed to be updated to allow for the new 
 Prem Pay Indicators.  In addition, the text and or hour limits associated 
 with several 8B edit checks also required updates.   
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The following 8B edit checks have been updated in the processing routines 
 or in the 8B ERROR MESSAGE (#455.1) file:
  
 Error  Description
 ==========================================================================
  27    With SA or SE, if Pay Plan is M then Duty Basis may be 1, 2 or 3.
        If Pay Plan is A and Premium Pay Indicator is E or F, then Duty
        Basis must be 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, Duty Basis must be 1
  
  73    With ON or CL, Pay Plan must be A, Premium Pay Ind must be
        U, V, W or Y
  
 140    SP or SQ cannot exceed 32.0 unless Pay Plan is A, B, C, K, M or N
        in which case SA or SE cannot exceed 40.0
  
 141    With SP or SQ, Pay Plan must be A, B, C, K, M or N
  
 149    With SP or SQ and Pay Plan is A, B, C or N, Premium Pay Indicator

 3. TUA-0104-31788  Problem with employee time card
 4. BIR-0204-31331  Timecard is not decomposing correctly
 5. NIN-0204-41511  ETA timecards
 6. PTH-0204-21736  Incorrect premium pay
  
 Problem:  
 --------
 Several of the new Premium Pay Indicators were not being properly 
 credited for Saturday Premium or other types of pay like Overtime and 
 Night Differential.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The portion of the software that determines Saturday Premium, Overtime 
 and Night Differential has been updated to correctly pay these types of 
 time for the new Premium Pay Indicators.
  
  
 Reported by Central PAID 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Timekeeper's Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty menu option runs
 several checks on the timecard as the changes are being saved.  One of
 the checks was preventing tours containing Stand-By from being assigned to
 employees who were eligible to work Stand-By.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine containing the edit checks was updated to allow the posting of
 tours with Stand-By for employees who are eligible for this type of time.
