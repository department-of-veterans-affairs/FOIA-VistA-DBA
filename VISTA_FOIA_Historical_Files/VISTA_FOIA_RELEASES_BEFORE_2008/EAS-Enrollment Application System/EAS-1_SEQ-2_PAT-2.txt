Subject: RECEIPT CONFIRMATION FOR 1010EZ

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  (1) Before installing this patch, please check the setup of the VA1010EZ 
      Mail Group at your site.  This mail group is critical to the proper
      functioning of patch EAS*1*2 and to the 1010EZ module in general.
      The record for VA1010EZ in file #3.8 must show the following:
   
      TYPE: public
      ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT?: NO
      ORGANIZER: <preferably your site's Enrollment Coordinator>
      Select MEMBER: <at least 1 user at your site; e.g., the Enrollment
                      Coordinator>
      REMOTE MEMBER: S.EAS EZ SERVER@<your_domain_name>
      Select AUTHORIZED SENDER: <must be empty>
    
      Note: <your_domain_name> must match the contents of ^XMB("NETNAME").
   
      Remind Members of VA1010EZ that there really is no reason to 
      retain the 1010EZ data messages indefinitely.  Once the message
      has been processed by S.EAS EZ SERVER, all data is safely stored
      in the 1010EZ HOLDING file (#712).  It can be easily viewed and
      printed from the 1010EZ module or directly through FileMan.
     
  (2) Patch EAS*1*2 provides an enhancement to the 1010EZ module, which
      will not be directly observed by users at the local site.
   
      (a) Since mid-February of this year, all 1010EZ data transmission
      messages from the On-Line 10-10EZ web site have been routed through
      Forum for distribution.  Recently, software modifications in the
      Forum system have allowed for tracking and reporting of 1010EZ
      transmission activity.  With installation of EAS*1*2 at all VistA 
      sites, 1010EZ transmission problems between the web server and
      Forum, or between Forum and the field sites, should be discovered
      and reported within 24 hours.
   
      For each future 1010EZ data transmission received at your site, a
      Receipt Confirmation message will be returned to Forum.  If Forum
      does not receive a Receipt Confirmation within 24 hours, then the
      1010EZ data transmission message will be re-sent to your site.  If
      Forum does receive a Receipt Confirmation after five (5) days have
      elapsed, then a NOIS report will be logged on behalf of your site
      by the 1010EZ module on Forum.  You can expect to be contacted by
      the National VistA Support (NVS) team that supports the EAS package.
      Forum will attempt to re-send the 1010EZ data transmission message 
      each day for no more than than ten (10) days.
   
      If your site receives a 1010EZ data transmission message from Forum,
      which matches one already in the local 1010EZ HOLDING file (#712),
      the message will not be processed further.  However, a Receipt
      Confirmation will still be sent to Forum.  
   
      Modifications were made to routine EASEZW to implement this
      enhancement.
    
      (b) The EAS EZ SERVER option is being updated so that messages  
      processed by the server will no longer be retained in a POSTMASTER
      mail basket.  The option's Menu Text is also being revised.
   
  (3) A NOIS report pointed out a problem with the 1010EZ server routine
      which caused the process to hang indefinitely.  This happens if 
      the veteran enters a "?" for data input to certain On-Line 10-10EZ
      form fields, e.g., Employer Street Address.  Routine EASEZW has 
      been modified to prevent this problem.
   
  (4) Revisions have been made to the both the Technical Manual and User
      Manual for EAS v1.0 to support the changes made with EAS*1*1 and
      EAS*1*2.
