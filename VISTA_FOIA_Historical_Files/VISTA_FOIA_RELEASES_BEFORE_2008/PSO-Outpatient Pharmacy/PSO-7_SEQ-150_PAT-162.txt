Subject: NARRATIVE TEXT AND WARNING LABEL FORMAT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix two similar issues regarding missing text
 on the printed prescription labels.
 
 The two issues this patch resolves are:
 
 1.  When printing prescription labels there is a potential that part 
     of the Narrative Text lines will be truncated.  Modifications
     have been made to resolve this problem while preserving the 
     narrative text format entered by the customer.  The text that 
     was previously truncated will now be moved to a new line.
 
 2.  When printing prescription labels there is a potential that some 
     lines will be skipped from printing on the prescription in the
     warning label section.  This issue was happening in rare cases
     when lines in the warning label had been deleted and new lines
     were added.  Modifications have been made to print the warning
     labels lines when this scenario is encountered.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
 The patch should be installed at off peak hours and when Outpatient users are
 not using the system. Installation will take less than One minute.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.

     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*162):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*162.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.

     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
