Associated patches: (v)PSO*7*213   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*245'

Subject: ENCAPSULATION FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch adds three new Outpatient Pharmacy Application Programming
 Interfaces (APIs).
  
 The first API (DIQ) requires five parameters to be passed in and data from
 the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) or the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) will be
 returned.  This API will invoke the EN^DIQ1 FileMan call and data will be
 returned to the calling application as specified in the EN^DIQ1 FileMan
 documentation.
  
 The second API (STATUS) requires three parameters to be passed in and data
 from the STATUS field (#100) from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is
 returned.  This API will invoke the FIELD^DID Fileman call and data will
 be returned to the calling application as specified in the FIELD^DID
 FileMan documentation.
  
 The third API (DIC) has three parameters and retrieves information 
 specific to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) or the OUTPATIENT SITE file 
 (#59). This API will invoke the ^DIC FileMan call and data will be
 returned to the calling application as specified in the ^DIC FileMan
 documentation.
  
 For more information, please see Forum DBIA 4858, or the Pharmacy
 Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem with the PROF^PSO52API API.  The first
 node of data returned is meant to return both the PRESCRIPTION NUMBER and
 it's IEN.  Currently, the IEN is not returned.  This patch will correct
 the problem.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem with the PSO^PSO53 API.  Currently 
 there is an undefined error when the API is run.  This patch will correct 
 the problem and ensure the functionality of the PSO^PSO53 API call.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch exports a routine that is a supported reference, so any other 
  Vista application can make a call to this routine. For that reason, it is
  recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a 
  minimum.
  
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*245)
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*245.
   
  5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
   
  7. When prompted "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
  from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
