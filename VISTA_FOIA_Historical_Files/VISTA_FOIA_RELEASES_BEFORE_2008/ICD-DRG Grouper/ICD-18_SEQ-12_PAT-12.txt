Subject: CTD - ICD CODE TEXT DESCRIPTORS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description:
============

  The Code Text Descriptor (CTD) project adds the functionality of 
  versioning the short and long-text descriptions of the International
  Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM), Diagnostic Related Groupings 
  (DRG), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4) and Healthcare Common 
  Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) classification systems.  Once installed,
  the long and short text descriptors presented for these classifications
  will be date-sensitive (versioned) for all text changes occurring since
  Oct 1, 2002.
  
  This patch modifies the data dictionary for ICD Diagnosis (file 80),
  ICD Operation/Procedure (file 80.1) and DRG file (80.2) to record 
  a continuing history of textual changes in the names and descriptions
  (short and long text) of diagnosis, procedures and DRG groupings.
  Several APIs have been modified to extract and return the date
  appropriate text based on the history stored in the new fields.
  
  API SUMMARY
  ===========
  
      $$ICDDX^ICDCODE(<Code/IEN>,<Date>,<DFN>,<Source>)
  
        ICD Diagnosis Short Text - This API has been modified to 
        return an 18 piece "^" delimited string containing information
        about an ICD Diagnosis code.  The 4th piece of the string is
        the name of the diagnosis (short text) and is date sensitive.
        The text returned is date appropriate based on the date passed
        to the API.  If no date is passed, then TODAY is used and the 
        current text is returned in piece 4.  If the date passed in 
        pre-dates text versioning (before Oct 1, 2002), then a warning
        message will be inserted at the 18th piece, warning the user that
        the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 3990)
  
      $$ICDOP^ICDCODE(<Code/IEN>,<Date>,<DFN>,<Source>)
  
        ICD Operation/Procedure Short Text - This API has been modified
        to return a 14 piece "^" delimited string containing information
        about an ICD Operation/Procedure code.  The 5th piece of the 
        string is the name of the Operation/Procedure (short text) and 
        is date sensitive.  The text returned is date appropriate based 
        on the dates passed to the API.  If no date is passed, then TODAY
        is used and the current text is returned in piece 5.  If the date 
        passed in pre-dates text versioning (before Oct 1, 2002), then a
        warning message will be inserted at the 14th piece, warning the
        user that the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 3990)
  
      $$ICDD^ICDCODE(<Code>,<Array>,<Date>)
  
        ICD Diagnosis/Procedure Description Long Text - This API has been
        modified to return the date sensitive ICD Diagnosis/Procedure
        description (long text).  The text returned is date appropriate
        based on the date passed to the API.  Output will be in an array 
        designated by an input parameter.  If the date passed in pre-dates
        text versioning (before Oct 1, 2002) then the array will contain 
        a blank line followed by a warning message that the text may be 
        inaccurate.  (DBIA 3990)
 
      PERIOD^ICDAPIU(<Code>,.<Array>)
  
        ICD Diagnosis/Procedure Short Text - This API has been modified
        to include a date sensitive diagnosis or procedure name (short 
        text) as the 2nd piece of a "^" delimited string.  The string 
        will be returned in an array passed in by reference and subscripted
        by the ICD Diagnosis activation date.  The text returned is date 
        appropriate based on the dates that define a period of activation
        for the ICD Diagnosis/Procedure code.  If the history/period has
        an activation date and no inactivation date, then TODAY will
        be used, providing the current text.  If the history/period has an 
        activation date and an inactivation date, then the inactivation
        date will be used, providing the text of the code on the day the
        period of activation ended.  (DBIA 3991)
  
      $$DRGD^ICDGTDRG(<Code>,<Array>,<Date>)             NEW
  
        DRG Description Long Text - This is a NEW API created to return 
        the date sensitive DRG description (long text).  The text returned
        is date appropriate based on the date passed to the API.  Output 
        will be in an array designated by an input parameter.  If the 
        date passed in pre-dates text versioning (before Oct 1, 2002) 
        then the array will contain a blank line followed by a warning 
        message that the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 4052)
