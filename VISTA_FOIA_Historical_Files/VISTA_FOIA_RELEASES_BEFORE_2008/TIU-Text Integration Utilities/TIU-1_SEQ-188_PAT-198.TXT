Subject: PROBLEM WITH NATIONAL TIU OBJECT AND TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER EDIT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 Two issues will be addressed in this patch.  The first is a problem with 
 the Active/Recent Meds Object.  The second will issue a warning message 
 when changing Document Definition in TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER EDIT.
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY/NOIS:
 ======================
 Problem 1:
 HD69691/ AUG-0302-31724
  
 Duplicates:
 HD70404
 HD100183
  
 Problem 2:
 HD71319/ERI-0305-20063

 REMDEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. HD 69691/AUG-0302-31724 
  
 Problem:
 =======
 The Active/Recent Med Object sometimes displays a discontinued Medication 
 instead of the active Medication that replaced it. This occurs as the 
 routine (TIULMED) is trying to eliminate duplicates.
 If the Medication and SIG are already in the work file it does not make 
 another entry.  So if the discontinued Medication is first, it is the one 
 that will be displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Add the status of the Rx to the work file key.  The key will be 
 Medication, SIG and Status of Rx.  This will allow the most recent 
 Medication within a status to be displayed by the object.
  
  
 2. HD71319/ERI-0305-20063
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When using the following option
 TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER EDIT     Document Parameter Edit
 Document Parameter Edit
 First edit Institution-wide parameters:
  
 Select DOCUMENT DEFINITION: PROGRESS NOTES       CLASS
          ...OK? Yes//   (Yes)
  
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION: PROGRESS NOTES//
  
 If DOCUMENT DEFINITION is accidentally changed, in this case a Progress 
 Note is edited or deleted, all parameters for the entry and any of its
 descendants will be lost (i.e. alert notification).
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 If the Document Definition is edited or deleted, the user will receive 
 the following message:
  
 You are about to loose the document parameters for "Document Definition"
 Do you wish to continue? NO//
  
 If the answer is No, the routine will exit the option.
 If the answer is Yes, it will allow the user to edit or delete the 
 document definition since they have been warned.

 ==========================
 This patch should  be loaded during non peak hours.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...

 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*198):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*198.

 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
     you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
