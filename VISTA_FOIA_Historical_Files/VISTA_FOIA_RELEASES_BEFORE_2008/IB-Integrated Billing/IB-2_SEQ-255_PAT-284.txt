Subject: MODIFICATION TO IIV STATISTICAL REPORT SENDER NAME

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  ******************************** N O T E ********************************
  There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS implementation. 
  Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
  problems.
  *************************************************************************
     
  A change in the way KERNEL handles names from the NEW PERSON file has
  caused the IIV STATISTICAL REPORT not to be delivered properly.  This has
  necessitated a change in a pseudo-user name used by the Insurance 
  Identification and Verification (IIV) module when utilizing MailMan to
  deliver the report to the IBCNE IIV MESSAGE mail group.

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1. MAR-0904-20335     NO IIV STATISTICAL REPORT
    
     Problem:
     --------
     After the installation of XU*8.0*343, sites began noticing that the
     IIV STATISTICAL REPORT was not being delivered through MailMan as it
     had been.  The report program tells MailMan to send the report as a
     message with a Sender name of "IB IIV INTERFACE".  Because of new
     parameters introduced by XU*8.0*343, this name is not accepted as a
     valid "Sender".
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The hard-coded name supplied to MailMan as the Sender, can be modified
     slightly so that it will be accepted.  The new form for the Sender 
     name will be "IIV INTERFACE (IB)".
    
  TECHNICAL:
  ==========
  1. MAR-0904-20335     NO IIV STATISTICAL REPORT

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
    
  This patch may be installed at any time, however, several options and
  an HL7 Logical Link must not be running.  These are detailed in the
  installation steps below.  Please follow the steps carefully.
  Install time - less than 2 minutes.  
    
    1.  This patch should NOT be installed during a time when the IIV
        STATISTICAL REPORT is scheduled to run.  Please check your local
        setting for the 'Time of day for daily statistical report:'
        in the IIV Site Parameters section of the MCCR Site Parameter
        Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS] option.
    
    2.  The "IIV SERVER" HL7 Logical Link must be stopped.  Use the Start/
        Stop Links [HL START] option to stop this link.  After the patch
        is installed, this link must be restarted (see step 10).
    
    3.  The IIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] must be 
        dequeued/Unscheduled prior to installation of this patch and 
        rescheduled following installation (see step 11).  Use TaskMan for
        this step.
    
    4.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
    5.  (DSM for open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all 
        systems for the routines listed in the routine summary.
           
         NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in
        your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
     
    6.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
        [XPD MAIN]: 
    
              Edits and Distribution ...  
              Utilities ...

        (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter IB*2.0*284):
    
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
            not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
            will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
            this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
            patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
    
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        IB*2.0*284.
    
        a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
            install- YES//', answer NO.
        b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
            Options, and Protocols- YES//' answer YES.
        c.  When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
            Order':", enter the following option:
   
            IIV Statistical Report    [IBCNE IIV STATISTICAL REPORT]
    
        d.  When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
             Order':", press <return>.
    
    9.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
        distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
   
        NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 5 or if   
        you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
    
    10. Restart the "IIV SERVER" HL7 Logical Link.  Use the Start/Stop 
        Links [HL START] option to start this link.
    
    11. Reschedule the IIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS].
