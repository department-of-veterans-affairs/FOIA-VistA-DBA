Associated patches: (v)XM*8*28     <<= must be installed BEFORE `XM*8*26'

Subject: PREVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE SELECTED QUEUEING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 If you select queueing when printing to P-MESSAGE, and then up-arrow out
 any time during the question and answer session, you are asked:
  
 "Previously, you have selected queueing.
 Do you STILL want your output QUEUED? YES//"
  
 It can get confusing from there, and even go into a loop, depending on how
 you answer.  This patch fixes the problem.
  
 Also, if you stay in user menu while selecting P-MESSAGE and then go to 
 another application with the DEVICE prompt, the XMQUIET variable is not 
 killed.  Therefore, the 'Subject' and the subsequent questions are not 
 asked (version 3 changes).

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ===============
    1. MAC-1203-61191     P-MESSAGE Device sporadic malfunction  bdj
  
       Problem
       -------
       Intermittently,  when trying to queue a report to the P-MESSAGE
       device,  the message "previously, you have selected queueing"
       is displayed, and then asks if you still want it queued.  If 
       you answer 'yes' you just keep looping through the same thing.
       If you answer 'no' then it goes back to device.  
  
      
       Resolution
       -----------
       Routine XMAPHOST has been modified to prevent the problem.

         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
