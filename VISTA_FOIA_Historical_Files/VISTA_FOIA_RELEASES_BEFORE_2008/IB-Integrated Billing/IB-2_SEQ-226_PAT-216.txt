Subject: ADMIT & DISCHARGE HOUR (Outpatient Claim)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch changes the settings in the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION file
  (#364.6) to allow local Output Formatter code to be written for the
  ADMISSION HOUR and DISCHARGE HOUR fields on the EDI 837 Transmission.

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1.  AUG-0103-31330     ADMIT & DISCHARGE HOUR (Outpatient Claim)
   
   Problem:
   --------
   Some of the insurance companies are rejecting outpatient claims when 
   submitted by electronic billing because the claims do not contain an
   ADMISSION HOUR and/or a DISCHARGE HOUR.  So far, this is a very small
   minority of companies and does not seem to warrant a nationwide change
   to the electronic billing procedures.  Normally, these fields do not
   apply to outpatient visits.  If a regional payer is requiring them, 
   they may have specific edit checks in place that do not apply to other
   regions.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The ADMISSION HOUR and DISCHARGE HOUR fields of the EDI 837 Transmission
   will be flagged to allow the local sites to create an Output Formatter
   override.  If a site has a payer requiring these fields then it will be
   necessary to find out exactly what the payer wants entered in the field
   and have the local IRM staff write the code to be used in the Output
   Formatter.  
   If you are not receiving rejected outpatient claims because of these 
   fields, then you do not need to take any action. The sites that 
   successfully tested the override utilized the data element type of 
   CONSTANT VALUE.
   For more information on using the Output Formatter see the
   Tips & Tricks document Output_Formatter_ITC_1999.pdf which can be
   downloaded from the anonymous.software ftp sites.

   a.  File 364.6, records 55 and 57, field .07 changed from 0 to 1,
       this changes up-arrow piece 7 of the zero node.
       The 7th piece represents (LOCAL OVERRIDE ALLOWED; 0=NO and 1=YES).
       Example from record 55:
       Before:  ^IBA(364.6,55,0) = 8^N^^50^1^^0^15^2^ADMISSION HOUR^^1
       After:  ^IBA(364.6,55,0) = 8^N^^50^1^^1^15^2^ADMISSION HOUR^^1
