Subject: PRN EFFECTIVENESS DOCUMENTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ***NOTE*** This patch should be discussed at each Department of 
 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) before being invoked. 
 
 Problem: Sites are experiencing a large number of undocumented 
 Pro Re Nata (PRN) effectiveness in the counter displaying under the
 "BCMA Clinical Reminders" section of the GUI Bar Code Medication
 Administration (BCMA) Virtual Due List (VDL). 
 
 Solution: The Bar Code Medication Administration Manager [PSB MGR] 
 menu contains the Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING] option 
 which will allow a user to run a report for a date range that will 
 search through the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79) for all 
 undocumented PRNs. The Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING]
 option will automatically enter in a comment of "Administrative Closure"
 for all undocumented PRNs identified by the report.
 
 In accordance with M1, Part 1, Chapter 5, these blank sections of the PRN 
 documentation will reflect the term "Administrative Closure" when the 
 software is used to close these blank portions related to the PRN 
 documentation. The sites medical record review committee should document 
 the decision to run the patch to administrative close the undocumented PRN 
 if the site chooses to use this option. In those cases where the sites have 
 reviewed the charts and find that the PRN documentation appears in the 
 patient record in other than the BCMA PRN field, the site should 
 individually enter "documented in progress note."
 
 The person installing the patch will receive a MailMan message when
 the process has completed. The subject line will read,
 "BCMA PRN DOCUMENTATION Notification."
