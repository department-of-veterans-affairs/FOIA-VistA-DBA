Associated patches: (v)PRPF*3*6    <<= must be installed BEFORE `PRPF*3*10'

Subject: CORRECT ERRONEOUS DISPLAY OF YEAR 2100 DATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is related to Y2K compliance and modifies code that incorrectly
 processes an internal system date (external date of 03/01/2100) to a date
 in external Fileman format.  This converted date is displayed in numerous
 report headers.  After this patch is installed the date will be properly
 converted and displayed.
  
 The following options use the corrected code:
  
 Archive Patient Funds Transactions         [PRPF ARCHIVE]
 Dormant Account Listing                    [PRPF DORMANT]
 Negative Balance Report                    [PRPF NEGATIVE BALANCES]
 Out of Balance Report                      [PRPF OUT OF BALANCE REPORT]
 Search for Min/Max Restrictions            [PRPF SEARCH FOR MIN/MAX]
 Out of Balance Report (TASKMAN)            [PRPF TASKMAN OUT OF BALANCE]
 Negative Balance Report (TASKMAN)          [PRPF TASKMAN NEGATIVE BAL]
 Transaction Display                        [PRPF TRANSACTION DISPLAY]
