Subject: NEW ACTION EDIT COSIGNER

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch sends out new USR action EDIT COSIGNER which is used to assign
 authorization to edit the Expected Cosigner of UNCOSIGNED documents
 without having access to the text body.
  
 This patch is sent out in a combined build with TIU*1*220, which adds new
 List Manager action EDIT COSIGNER to TIU VISTA options.
  
 I. DESCRIPTION
 ==============
 USR action EDIT COSIGNER permits editing the Expected Cosigner of 
 UNCOSIGNED documents using a new TIU VISTA List Manager action which does
 not include access to the text body. Additionally, if business rules exist
 allowing the editing of unsigned documents, this option may be used to 
 change the Expected Cosigner of UNSIGNED documents.  In the new TIU VISTA
 List Manager action, only UNCOSIGNED documents are audited.
  
 Authorization for general edit (including Expected Cosigner) of UNSIGNED
 documents is still assigned using existing action EDIT RECORD.
  
  
 II. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
 ========================
  
  USR ACTION FILE [#8930.8]
  =========================
  New action EDIT COSIGNER is exported with IEN 27 (assuming the existing
  USR ACTION file has the standard IENS and actions). The Data Dictionary
  is NOT updated.
  
  An environment check routine warns users if their USR ACTION file is
  non-standard and prevents the install. If you receive this warning, 
  please contact Enterprise Vista Support (EVS) by entering a Remedy
  Ticket.
  
  If the site already has action EDIT COSIGNER, it is overwritten.
  
  
 III. POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - BUSINESS RULES
 ====================================================
  
 Sites will need to add business rules for action EDIT COSIGNER before
 users can edit UNCOSIGNED documents using new List Manager action EDIT
 COSIGNER.
  
 We recommend the following rules:
  
    An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may HAVE ITS COSIGNER EDITED
      by a CHIEF,MIS
    An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may HAVE ITS COSIGNER EDITED
      by an EXPECTED COSIGNER
    An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may HAVE ITS COSIGNER EDITED
      by a CLINICAL SERVICE CHIEF
    An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may HAVE ITS COSIGNER EDITED
      by a CLINICAL COORDINATOR
    An UNCOSIGNED (CLASS) CLINICAL DOCUMENT may HAVE ITS COSIGNER EDITED
      by an AUTHOR/DICTATOR
  
 Note on UNSIGNED Document Rules:
 Although the new List Manager action EDIT COSIGNER respects USR action
 EDIT COSIGNER rules for UNSIGNED documents as well as for UNCOSIGNED
 documents, we assume that sites already have rules for UNSIGNED documents 
 using USR action EDIT RECORD. Thus, new rules for UNSIGNED documents 
 should not be necessary.
