Description: 
============

 This patch fixes the following problems:
  
 1) The wrong Radiology data displayed to the user in the Edit a Procedure
    option.
  
 The Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE] option can display radiology
 report data from the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine package if the Women's
 Health procedure entry is linked to a Radiology/NM procedure entry via the
 Radiology/NM day-case number. The day-case number value is used to find a
 Radiology patient's procedure in a Radiology/NM file cross-reference. The
 day-case number may not be a unique value at an integrated facility. The
 Women's Health package took the first entry it found. A facility reported
 having two entries with the same day-case number in the cross-reference
 for two different patients which resulted in the wrong radiology report
 data being displayed to the user. The routine WVRADWP was modified to make
 certain the correct entry is selected.
  
 Associated NOIS: GNH-1298-42141
  
 2) The Pregnancy Test labels on the Procedure Statistics Report [WV PRINT
    PROCEDURE STATS] are reversed.
  
 The Procedure Statistics Report [WV PRINT PROCEDURE STATS] output displays
 counts of patients and procedures. The labels for PREGNANT and NOT
 PREGNANT under the Pregnancy Test procedure are reversed. Also, for the
 procedure counts a label of NORMAL appears which should read NOT PREGNANT.
 The routine WVRPPCD1 was modified to fix the problem.
  
 Associated NOIS: LEB-1298-21991
  
 3) Up-arrow does not take user out of the Print Notification Purpose &
    Letter File [WV PRINT NOTIF PURPOSE&LETTER] option.
  
 If the output from the Print Notification Purpose & Letter File
 [WV PRINT NOTIF PURPOSE&LETTER] option is displayed to the terminal screen
 and an up-arrow is typed at the 'Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit:'
 prompt, the user is not exited from the option. The routine WVPURP and
 print template WV PRINT NOTIF PURPOSE&LETTER were modified to fix this
 problem.
  
 Associated NOIS: LEB-1298-21991             
  
 4) Undefined variable error with the WV CASE MANAGER file (#790.01).
  
 The data dictionary of the WV CASE MANAGER file (#790.01) has a check for
 the value of the KERNEL variable XQY0. If an IRMS user does a sort/print
 or inquire of the file using the FileMan sort/print or inquiry utilities,
 there is an undefined variable error. The routine WVUTL1A was modified to
 fix the problem.
  
 Associated NOIS: None. The problem was reported by SQA.
  
 5) No PACKAGE file (#9.4) entry for VISTA WOMEN'S HEALTH package.
  
 Facilities that have the Indian Health Service (IHS) version of the
 Women's Health package may not have an entry in their PACKAGE file (#9.4)
 for the VISTA version of the Women's Health package since the package
 names are the same. The VISTA version (1.0) and WV*1.0*3 entries in the
 BUILD (#9.6) and INSTALL (#9.7) files may point to the IHS version entry
 in FILE 9.4. The routine WV4PST will task a job to run two minutes after
 this patch is installed. It will add an entry to FILE 9.4 for the VISTA
 version if one doesn't already exist. Also, it will point the BUILD and
 INSTALL file entries for VISTA version (1.0), WV*1.0*3 and WV*1.0*4 to the
 correct FILE 9.4 entry.
