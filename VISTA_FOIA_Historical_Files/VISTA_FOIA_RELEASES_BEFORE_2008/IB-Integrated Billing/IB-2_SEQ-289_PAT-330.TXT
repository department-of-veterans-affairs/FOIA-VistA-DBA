 *******************************************************************
 The software to implement the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
 wide maximum outpatient medication co-payment cap was released in prior 
 software patch, IB*2.0*168.  IB*2.0*330 patch will implement the 
 necessary changes to make the cap software active.
  
 On November 30, 1999, the Millennium Health Care Act, Public Law 106-117, 
 Section 201, was signed giving VA the authority to increase the billing 
 rate and to establish a Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) wide maximum
 cap for outpatient medication co-payment.
  
 The official effective dates for the changes to the Outpatient Medication 
 Co-payment is January 1, 2006.  This patch, when installed, will update 
 the rates and implement the VA wide co-payment cap functionality.
  
 Effective January 1, 2006, the charge for each 30 days supply of 
 Outpatient Medication will be increased from a $7.00 to $8.00 co-payment.
 This change will apply to all veterans whom currently pay Outpatient 
 Medication Co-payments.
  
 Along with the rate change, there continues to be a VA wide maximum
 outpatient medication co-payment cap.  The cap amount was officially
 approved as $960 per calendar year for priority level 2 - 6 patients.  
 Priority level 7 and 8 patients will have no co-payment cap.
