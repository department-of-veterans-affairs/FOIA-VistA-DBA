Description: 
============

 NOTE: There are 2 steps to install this patch. The first step is to install
       the server (VISTA) software released as a KIDS build and the second
       step is to install the client software. The patch MUST be installed
       in this order.
 
 This patch is designed to be a major improvement to AICS functionality and
 particularly to the scanning process.  The primary functionality is
 related to removing "Phantom" data that is found during scanning.  Other
 workstatation and server changes are also included.
 
 The patch is comprised of both a client (PC workstation) component and a
 server (KIDS build) component.  It is  necessary that the KIDS build be
 installed on the server prior to installation on the client workstations.
 
 The workstation installation is a full AICS client installation (minus the
 tutorials) and can be used to install AICS on a PC where AICS did not
 previously reside.  However, Paper Keyboard and RPC Broker v1.0 must both
 be previously installed.  The  workstation installation will also install
 a copy of the Forum description in text format in the same directory as
 where the AICS software is installed (the default value is C:\Vista\Aics)
 
 The following nineteen NOIS calls are being addressed in this patch:

 Phantom Resolution
 ------------------
 A number of changes have been made to reduce the "Phantom" data found in
 hand print fields.
 
    1.  The logic for scanning hand print fields has been
        improved so that frequently found bad data or phantoms are 
        automatically removed.  If the phantom value contains
        only a series of dots and/or dashes, then this value is 
        deleted and no user intervention is needed.
 
    2.  A new site parameter has been added that allows a small
        reduction in size of the area paper keyboard searches 
        for each hand print field.  This will allow AICS to 
        "look inside" of the series of dots that may not be 
        removed.  The installation will automatically set this
        value to 5 and thus reduce the recognition area by
        .5mm on each side.
 
    3.  Two new site parameters have been added that effect the
        darkness of the dots.  Thus if a site has a printer
        that prints darker than other sites, though the same 
        values are used, they can lighten the printing of dots 
        that form bubbles and hand print fields.
 
 Storing Hand Print Field Data after Scanning
 --------------------------------------------
 When scanning encounter forms with hand print fields where a user had
 written in the "Other" diagnosis or procedure information, it was possible
 for several related problems to occur.
 
    1.  If the bubble preceding a hand written procedure is filled
        in but no narrative or code is entered then a treatment 
        with the narrative of "Other#" was being added to PCE.  With
        this patch these will no longer be sent to PCE and AICS will
        no longer log an error.
 
    2.  AICS will now pull the appropriate narrative from the CPT
        or ICD-9 file if the narrative for handprint ICD or CPT
        codes is not specified on the encounter form.
 
 List Errors Fixes
 -----------------
 When initially loading the List Errors window in the AICS Workstation
 software the list of Errors will be immediately displayed.  If the error
 chosen has Health Factors an RPC Broker Error may occur due to an error
 on the server.  This is fixed in this patch.
 
 Auto Logoff During overnight Logon
 ----------------------------------
 When AICS is left running overnight, the connection to VistA may be
 disconnected due to the timeout process.  When this occurs users would
 have problems in using AICS.  This is fixed in this patch.
 
 Sorting of Clinics During EF Printing
 -------------------------------------
 A number of sites have complained that during the printing of
 encounter forms the order of the clinics does not necessarily
 come out correctly.  This is improved in this patch.
 
 Scrunching of CPT Narratives Fix
 ---------------------------------
 If a CPT related data element was scanned and the narrative
 contained the same digit as the quantity field for the CPT code,
 usually a "1", the narrative was scrunched.  That is,
 the character before the digit, the digit, and the next character
 were erroneously removed from the text.  This is fixed in this patch.
 
 CHECKOUT DATE@TIME Problem
 --------------------------
 When the hand print field for the checkout date and time was
 placed on the form, a "9" was automatically placed as the first
 digit in a 2 digit year.  This digit will no longer be printed
 or scanned so that problems do not occur beginning in year 2000.
 
 AICS Enhancements
 -----------------
 In order to improve the ease of using the AICS software for 
 scanning the following enhancements were made:
 
    1.  Images will now be created when a forms data does not 
        pass to PCE successfully.  If an encounter form consists
        of more than one page the only image that is created is 
        of the final page to be scanned. 
 
    2.  The Close button, on the main screen has been removed.
        The use of this button has previously caused confusion
        and occasional problems.
  
    3.  The Workstation menus have been changed.  The 
        Show/Hide tool bar and stat bar options are now shown
        with check marks like the "Ask when Deleting" option.
        This is consistent with Paper Keyboard.  Clear Links 
        was removed from the Scanning menu and save preferences
        was removed from the File menu.
 
    4.  Two messages in the master formspec that occur in 
        Attended operations (validation mode) but lose focus 
        (move to the background) will no longer be displayed.
        These messages had the potential to stop processing.
        The information provided by these messages is displayed 
        in AICS thus allowing the processing to continue.  
 
    5.  When changing the workstation mode to Validation, the 
        duplex scanner field will automatically switch to off.
        When changing from Validation mode to another workstation
        mode the duplex scanner field will return to the
        value stored in the Vista.Ini file.
 
    6.  Hitting the F1 key will now bring up the AICS help for
        the main screen and for preferences.
 
    7.  When a form is scanned or an image is loaded, the initial  
        picture will now be in the upper left hand corner 
        instead of the bottom right hand side.  This will be 
        most obvious when dealing with problems and shouldn't
        affect daily scanning.
 
    8.  When in centralized mode and the scanner runs out of 
        paper the view on the monitor should now return to AICS's
        main screen.
 
    9.  The miss-spelled word "Repors" in a Paper Keyboard dialog
        box has been corrected.
 
   10.  When using the Error List box it was possible to get an
        error.  This occurred when:
            a.  click the more button to get a longer list
            b.  click the corrected box
            c.  do not save the correction
            d.  change the type of list  
        This is fixed in this patch.
 
   11.  The checksum values are no longer hidden during
        scanning.  If the anchors for a form are found but 
        there is difficulty in retrieving data from the top 
        line of the form, the user will be allowed to correct
        all values scanned during attended operations.
        If a form was previously scanned where there were 
        problems, users were prevented from making
        reasonable corrections to the checksum values.
 
 Guidelines for Reporting Scanning Problems
 ------------------------------------------
 If you ever have problems with scanning that you believe
 should be reported to Customer Service (NVS) or development
 (Technical Services) then the following is offered as
 guidelines for viewing the problem and consequently
 reporting the problem.
 
    1.  Start Paper Keyboard (before starting AICS).  On Windows
        95 click on the Start button, first select programs, 
        and click on the Paper Keyboard folder.  Click on Paper
        Keyboard to start the application.
 
    2.  Under the Edit/Preferences option in Paper Keyboard
        check the field called Inspect Each Field.
 
    3.  Click OK but do not save the settings.
 
    4.  In Paper Keyboard, under View, the line Show Bounds 
        should have a check mark by it.  If its missing, select
        Save Setting to turn on this feature.
 
    5.  Start AICS and Log in.
 
    6.  In the AICS preferences option make sure that the 
        Attended Operations box is checked and the box for
        Show Raw Data is checked.
 
    7.  Click the Start Button to begin scanning.
 
    8.  Click the Accept button on the Field Value Box until you can
        see where the form spec is not picking up a correct value.
 
    9.  If you have a problem with AICS not identifying a field 
        correctly, you will generally see the red box outline for the
        recognized field surrounding incorrect printed value..
 
   10.  What needs to be reported is the relationship of the red box
        to the field value, is it too high, too low, too far left, 
        too far right or does it pick up text that confuses it, etc.
        Is the error occurring in one of the master form specs 
        (aicsmstr.fs) or in the form specific form spec 
        (i.e. ef2555.fs).  Normally problems are reported to Customer
        Support, however, if you are testing a patch the problems 
        should be reported in the POC message for the patch.
 
   11.  If you choose to report the problem then it is recommended
        that via Exchange you include a copy of the image, a copy 
        of the forms spec file for that image, and a copy of the 
        displayed text in the notebook for the image.

 *******************CLIENT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS************************
 DESCRIPTION:
 This installation is a complete AICS workstation installation
 and must be done on each AICS workstation.  It can be used when 
 setting up new installations on a PC without having to previously
 install other versions.  However, there are 3 tutorials that are
 part of new user help that are not included in this installation.
 The tutorials can be obtained by first installing the initial
 AICS workstation software and then installing this patch.
 
 RPC Broker v1.0 and Paper Keyboard v2.53 must be installed on
 on each workstation prior to installing AICS patch IBD*3*25.
 
 The installation on each workstation will install new versions of
 the AICS software (IBDSCAN.EXE and IBDABOUT.DLL) and new master
 formspec files (AICSMSTR.FS and AICSSCAN.FS).  In addition, an
 update to the Paper Keyboard software will be made.  Existing
 formspec files for each version of the encounter form will be
 deleted and the new ones will automatically be loaded as
 necessary on the workstation.
  
 FILES RETRIEVAL: 
 ----------------   
 The client software and the documentation files are available
 on the following CIO Field Offices' Anonymous.Software directories.
 Use the appropriate FTP capability to retrieve the files.

 You will be prompted to indicate whether you would like to create
 backup copies of all files replaced as an option during the
 installation.  When installing this patch, the AICS Scanning 
 Workstation application MUST NOT be running on the workstation.  
  
 **NOTE:  The Client software is all-inclusive.  It includes all previously
          released workstation patches.  The IBD_3_25.EXE file may be run on
          new workstations or on top of a pre-existing version of the
          software.
 
  1.  Get the IBD_3_25.EXE file using FTP. This must be obtained from the 
      appropriate aonymous software directory.   Make sure to set transfer 
      as BINARY. Depending on the FTP software, this file might be placed in 
      the c:\WINDOWS, c:\, or some other directory.  Careful attention to 
      the FTP client's setup should show where downloaded files will be 
      placed. If you cannot find it use Win 95's Find File or Folder
      functionality.  
   
  2.  Copy the file IBD_3_25.EXE file into an empty (temporary or scratch) 
      directory.  
   
  3.  Run the IBD_3_25.EXE   This starts the AICS installation.
      Double click on the file name from within EXPLORER or use 
      the RUN option on the START menu and type IBD_3_25.EXE 
   
      Take all the default prompts unless they were overridden during the 
      original install of AICS V3.0 on the workstation.  The actual 
      install should take less than one minute.  
 
  4.  When finished, start the AICS workstation software.  If AICS and
      Paper Keyboard both start successfully you can safely delete the
      IBD_3_25.EXE file from the workstation.
