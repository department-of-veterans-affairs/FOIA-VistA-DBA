Subject: MODIFICATIONS TO IB*2*184

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch corrects several issues related to Insurance Identification 
 and Verification functionality.  The first issue is where Insurance Company  
 specific data in the Insurance Buffer could not be edited when a new        
 Insurance Company (not in current Insurance Company and Auto Match files) was
 entered.  This problem was unique to entering a new Insurance Company using  
 the Process Insurance Buffer option.  A second issue identified and         
 corrected by this patch concerned response processing where Critical messages
 were generated erroneously.  Third, the IIV Payer Link Report was modified  
 to address some formatting issues.  Also, data entered for an 'Insurance    
 Company Keyword Search' will no longer be case sensitive.  Fourth, a problem  
 that predates patch IB*2*184 was identified during the testing phase of this  
 patch.  The Add action of the Insurance Buffer option had the potential of  
 generating a blank Insurance Company Name. Lastly, terminology that was     
 confusing to some users was changed in the Auto Match options.  The word    
 "link" was replaced with "associate" to separate the linkage concept in     
 Auto Match from that of the Insurance Company/Payer functionality.

 POR-0903-52494         BUFFER FILE PROBLEMS
 BAY-1003-30706         Critical Message received from IIV
 LOU-0903-42302         IIV Payer Link Report /column

 Overview of Patch Items:
 ------------------------
                  
 1)  Problem:    POR-0903-52494         BUFFER FILE PROBLEMS
     --------
     IIV user reported frustration at having to page through the insurance 
 lister and possible Auto Match lister once before adding the Insurance 
 Buffer entry and when editing the Insurance Buffer entry.  Further, 
 entering a caret '^' at the first prompt quits the activity and at the 
 second, drops the user down into editing the Group Buffer information 
 preventing the user from updating Insurance Company related information 
 from within the Process Insurance Buffer option.  
                      
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The functionality was changed to permit the caret '^' to quit the 
 lister, but allow the user to proceed to the next prompt rather than 
 quitting the editing session for that section. 
                      
 2)  Problem:    BAY-1003-30706         Critical Message received from IIV
     --------
     A problem with response processing was discovered after patch 
 IB*2.0*184 was released nationally.  When responses are received as a result  
 of a true "cache hit", a safety check was triggered that prevented the 
 response from being filed, due to the fact that the EC sends the DFN from 
 the original transaction to the site receiving the cached information.
  
     The DFN will always be different at the second site, however the ICN is 
 the same nationwide.
                  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The safety check was revised to be more sensitive to the ICN, as 
 opposed to DFN changes.
  
 3)  Problem:
     --------
     Sites had suggested that the error messages associated with NOIS: 
 BAY-1003-30706 should not be marked as CRITICAL but instead should be 
 changed to IMPORTANT.
                  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified the error text for the error condition, so that the message 
 is not quite so alarming and added the ICN value to the message to assist 
 with troubleshooting.  
  
 4)  Problem:    LOU-0903-42302         IIV Payer Link Report /column
     --------
     Fields in the IIV Payer Link Report were being truncated and spaces 
 were missing between adjacent fields causing the report to be difficult 
 to read.    
                      
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The report was adjusted to a 132-character format allowing sufficient 
 space for all columns and including spaces between columns.
  
 5)  Problem:
     --------
     Users requested that the "Enter an insurance company search keyword" 
 prompt be modified to be case insensitive.  Therefore if "Aetna" were 
 entered at this prompt, AETNA, Aetna, aetna, etc. would all match this 
 criterion.
                     
     Resolution:
     ----------
     The field is now case insensitive.
  
 6)  Problem:
     --------
     While testing a modification to the Insurance Buffer, we determined 
 that there is a problem with the Add Entry action.  If an Insurance 
 Company name is entered that is less than the minimum 3 character field 
 length and no entries are selected from potential matches identified in  
 the Insurance Company and/or Auto Match files, a blank Insurance Company 
 Name is filed in the Insurance Buffer.
                     
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Added a format check (and the display of help text, if appropriate) 
 before allowing the user to add a new buffer entry.
  
 7)  Problem:    UNY-1003-12260         <NULLSUBSCR>VALID+5^IBCNEUT4
     --------
     A Null Subscript error was returned when performing an Expand Entry 
 action in the Insurance Buffer for selected entries.  This occurred when 
 an Insurance Company was created.  Next, an Auto Match entry was linked to  
 this company.  Then a buffer entry was added with the same name as the Auto  
 Match entry, but it was identified as a new entry.  Finally, the Insurance  
 Company is deleted.
                      
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The routine was modified to validate the existence of the Insurance 
 Company before validating the payer link.
                 
 8)  Problem:
     --------
     There was some confusion expressed by the users in the use of the 
 word "link" to both explain the connection between the Auto Match and 
 Insurance Company files and the relationship between the Payer and 
 Insurance Company files.
                     
     Resolution:
     ----------
     In order to distinguish between the meaning of an Auto Match link and 
 a Payer link, the terminology used with Auto Match entries was changed 
 from "link" to "associate."
                 
 9)  Problem:
     --------
     An IIV user reported that when running the IIV Payer Link report,  
 using the Insurance Co List option, certain insurance companies were not 
 displayed.  Although they met the criteria.
                     
     Resolution:
     ----------
     The code was revised to terminate a loop through the Insurance 
 Company file based on the truth value of variable IBINS rather than based 
 on a format check.
  
                 
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should not be installed while the IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS is 
 running.  If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that
 the following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
      Process Insurance Buffer  [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS]
      IIV Payer Link Report     [IBCNE IIV PAYER LINK REPORT]
   
 In addition, the IIV SERVER HL7 Logical Link must be stopped using the 
 Start/Stop Links [HL START] option prior to performing the install and 
 restarted once the installation process has completed.  This is required 
 as the routines that perform response processing have been altered in 
 this patch. Also, unschedule the IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS option in 
 TaskMan.
