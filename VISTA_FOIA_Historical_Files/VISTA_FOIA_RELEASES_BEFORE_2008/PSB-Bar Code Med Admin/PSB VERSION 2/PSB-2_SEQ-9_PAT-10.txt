Subject: BCMA LABEL PRINT OPTION DRUG VALIDATION   

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
   Patch Description:
   =================
   Problem: In reference to the Label Print [PSBO BL] option, a problem was
   discovered in the drug validation process used to compare the selected
   drug with medication orders listed for the patient. The drug validate
   process was performed only if the system device was set to BROWSER or
   the user device.
  
   Corrective Action: The Label Print [PSBO BL] option was modified to
   perform the drug validate process before the device selection process.  
   Therefore, the drug validation process will be performed if the system
   device was set to BROWSER or queued to a device.
  
   Problem: In reference to the Label Print [PSBO BL] option, a problem was
   discovered in the coding logic that created an entry in the BCMA REPORT
   REQUEST file (#53.69).  If the user canceled the label print process as
   a result of a mismatch between the selected drug and patient, an
   impartial or bogus entry would remain in the BCMA REPORT REQUEST file
   (#53.69) occupying vital system resources.
  
   Corrective Action: The Label Print [PSBO BL] option was modified by
   inserting the necessary coding logic to delete the impartial or bogus
   entry in the BCMA REPORT REQUEST file (#53.69) when the print label
   procedure is cancelled as a result of a mismatch between the selected
   drug and patient.
  
   Problem: In reference to the Label Print option, a problem was
   discovered in the ScreenMan data input functions.  If the selected
   patient requires a Means Test, the option will abruptly display a
   message to the user indicating "*** Patient Requires a Means Test ***"
   and the ScreenMan data input process was rearranged out of order.
  
   Corrective Action: The Label Print [PSBO BL] option was modified by
   inserting the necessary coding logic to refresh the ScreenMan data input
   screen when the Means Test notification message rearranged the data
   input process.  By refreshing the screen, the data input flow will
   return to the next data input field.
  
   Problem: In reference to the Label Print [PSBO BL] option, a problem was
   discovered in the coding logic used to set a variable that contained the
   internal entry number of the selected drug.  This problem was not
   discovered in the initial release of BCMA V. 2.0.
  
   Corrective Action:  The Label Print [PSBO BL] option was modified by
   inserting the correct coding logic to extract and store the selected
   drug internal entry number in the proper variable.
  
   Problem: In reference to the Label Print [PSBO BL] option, a problem was
   discovered in the drug validation process used to check the patient
   medication orders. The option only validated medication orders that were
   classified a Unit Dose and it did not validate medication orders that
   were classified as IV orders containing IV Additives and IV Solutions.
  
   Corrective Action:  The Label Print [PSBO BL] option was modified by
   inserting the proper coding logic to validate IV orders that contained
   IV Additives and IV Solutions.
