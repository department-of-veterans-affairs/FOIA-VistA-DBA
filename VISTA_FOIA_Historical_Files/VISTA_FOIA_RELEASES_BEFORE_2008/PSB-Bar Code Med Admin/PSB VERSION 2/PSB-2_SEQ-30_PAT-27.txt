     The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option 
     and the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option displays
     the Pro Re Nata (PRN) Effectiveness reasons on one continuous sentence 
     rather than wrapping the information to several lines for viewing.

     option and the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] 
     option display the PRN Effectiveness reasons using word wrap.

     The Patient Due List Report and the Ward Administration Time Report 
     will not display a "due" medication, on the correct day, for schedules  
     with frequencies greater than 24 hours, (i.e.,Q36).
     
     Corrective Action: The Patient Due List Report and the Ward 
     Administration Time Report display "due" medication, on the correct
     day, for schedules with a frequency greater then 24 hours.
 
 
 6.  Problem: NOIS MAD-0303-40194 
     The Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option, Medication Log 
     Report displays the medication as "GIVEN" with the incorrect dosage value, 
     after the medication status was marked as "Not Given" on the VDL.
  
     Corrective Action: The Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option
     and the Medication Log Report display the medications administration  
     units of zero when the medication is set to "NOT GIVEN" on the VDL. 
 
 
 7.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30482

     column, for all days on the report, even after the medication is 
     taken Off Hold.

     option, Medication History Report, displays "HOLD" in the Date column 
     on the days that the medication was placed On Hold, through the end 
     date of the report. When the medication is taken Off Hold, the word
