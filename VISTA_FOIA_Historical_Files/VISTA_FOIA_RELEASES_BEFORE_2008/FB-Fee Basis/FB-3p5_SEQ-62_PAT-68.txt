Description:
============

 ******************************** N O T E ********************************
 CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with the 
 FB-CoreFLS development team.
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch corrects two faults with the Fee Basis software.  An undefined
 error may occur during entry of a pharmacy invoice.  Applicable adjustment
 data for an EDI claim is not always included in transmissions to the Fee
 Payment Processing System (FPPS).

 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1. PREVENT UNDEFINED ERROR WHEN RX ADDED TO EXISTING PHARMACY INVOICE
    (MIN-1103-40659)
  
    An undefined error (variable FBFPPSC) occurs when the Enter Pharmacy
    Invoice [FBAA ENTER PHARMACY INVOICE] option is used to add
    prescriptions to a previously entered invoice.  This fault was 
    introduced by patch FB*3.5*61.
  
    A previously entered invoice can be accessed by responding to the
    option prompts as follows.
  
       Select Pharmacy Fee Main Menu Option: ENTER Pharmacy Invoice
  
       Are you sure you want to enter a new invoice? Yes// NO
  
       Do you want to continue a previously entered Invoice? No// YES
  
       Select FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE NUMBER:
  
    Patch FB*3.5*68 corrects the problem by setting variable FBFPPSC when
    a previously entered invoice is selected. 
  
  
 2. SEND ADJUSTMENT DATA TO FPPS WHEN AMOUNT IS NEGATIVE (ISW-1103-20349)
  
    Patch FB*3.5*61 introduced a new interface.  For EDI health care 
    claims, VistA Fee Basis transmits payment advice messages to the Fee
    Payment Processing System (FPPS) at HAC (Denver) using HL7 messages.
    The message content is built by the Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS 
    TRANSMIT] option.
  
    The new interface has a fault. It does not include the adjustment data
    in the HL7 message when the adjustment amount is less than 0.
  
    Civil Hospital claims may have a negative adjustment amount since the 
    amount paid by VA can exceed the amount claimed by the non-VA hospital.
    This can occur when the amount returned from the Austin Pricer is
    greater than the amount billed by the vendor.
  
    Patch FB*3.5*68 corrects the software so negative adjustments are sent
    to FPPS.
  
 ======================= INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =======================
  
 If installed during the normal workday it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible
