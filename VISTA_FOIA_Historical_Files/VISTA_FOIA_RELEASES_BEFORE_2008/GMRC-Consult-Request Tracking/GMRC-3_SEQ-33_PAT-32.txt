Description:
============

 This patch is intended to correct one possible error exported in patch 
 GMRC*3*31. It also includes a follow-up step to any problems reported by the 
 post-install from GMRC*3*31.
  
 Issue 1:
 The post-install routine from GMRC*3*31 (D POST^GMRCYP31) could produce an 
 error if the output was sent to a printer, but no items appeared on the
 report. This problem is corrected with this patch.
  
 Issue 2:
 The post-install of GMRC*3*31 produced a report on inter-facility consults of
 any activities where the possibility exists that extraneous line(s) of
 text may be appended to comments of some activities sent from a remote
 site. Only Inter-facility Consults that have had the FORWARD and SIG
 FINDINGS UPDATE actions utilized upon them at the remote site have the
 potential of causing this problem. This problem can only occur on comments
 that are greater than one line in length. 
  
 This patch provides an option that may be assigned to Clinical
 Coordinators to aid in the administrative correction of the extraneous
 comments previously identified. Only those actions meeting the criteria
 for having extraneous comments will be available for editing. If the
 comment associated with an action is edited, an additional activity is
 added to the consult/procedure request to document and provide an audit
 for the administrative correction.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch should be installed at non-peak hours due to the high volume
 use of the routines included. Installation should take less than 5 
 minutes. Users may remain on the system during installation.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*32):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRC*3.0*32
  6.  When prompted " Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//",respond NO.
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//'
      respond NO.
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  
 POST-INSTALLATION:
 ==================
 There are several steps involved in determining the need for any post-install 
 activities. If the post-install for GMRC*3*31 (D POST^GMRCYP31) was run and 
 the report showed no items, or all items were verified to have correct 
 comments, then there is no additional work to be done with this patch. If 
 your site is unsure of the items on the report from GMRC*3*31, it SHOULD 
 be run again. Running POST^GMRCYP31 from a programmer's prompt, will 
 produce a report.  After reviewing the report:
  
 1) If all items on the report appear to be correct (refer to the patch 
    description for GMRC*3*31), stop. If any items require correction,
    proceed to step 2.
 2) Assign the Limited IFC Admin corrections [GMRC ADMP31 CORRECTIONS]
    option to a clinical coordinator or another designee.
 3) Use the new option to review and identify any activities requiring 
    correction.
 4) Edit the incorrect comments to assure they match the comment on file at 
    the consulting facility. 
 5) Optionally, the POST^GMRCYP31 entry point may be run again to verify that 
    all comments are now correct.
