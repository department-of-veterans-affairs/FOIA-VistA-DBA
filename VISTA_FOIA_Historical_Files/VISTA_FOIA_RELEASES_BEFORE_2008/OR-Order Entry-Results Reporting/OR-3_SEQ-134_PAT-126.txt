Subject: Using JAWS with CPRS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

  
 Information in this patch concerns any site that uses the JAWS screen 
 reader software and CPRS GUI.  Instructions are listed below to assist 
 users in setting up a JAWS configuration file, which will help JAWS 
 recognize many of the custom screen elements in CPRS.
  
 This information is given as a first step in making CPRS more accessible 
 for JAWS users.
 
  
 JAWS Configuration Files
 ========================
  
 Users can create a JAWS custom configuration file for any application.  The 
 configuration file tells JAWS how to behave for certain elements in the 
 application, including elements it may not know how to process.
  
 Screen elements in Windows are commonly called "screen controls" or just 
 "controls".  Several custom controls were developed to make CPRS more 
 functional and easier to program.  Most of these controls were built on 
 pre-defined Windows controls (like buttons and drop-down lists.)  In 
 updating the JAWS configuration file, we will tell JAWS to treat these 
 custom controls like the standard Windows controls.
 
 For example, one of the custom buttons in CPRS is the "New Note" button on
 the Notes tab.  If you use JAWS and use the tab key to reach this button, 
 JAWS only says "New Note".  At this point, if you're a visually impaired 
 person, you're not sure what the component is that you've landed on.  After
 implementing one of the options below, when you tab to that button, JAWS 
 will say "New Note button".  This scenario is the same with the other controls
 listed in the instructions below.
  
 There are 4 ways to set up the JAWS configuration file for CPRS.  The 
 first, and easiest, is to download a ready made configuration file from one 
 of the ANONYMOUS FTP directories.  The second is to cut and paste text into a 
 configuration file.  The third method is to create a new file and cut and 
 paste into it. The fourth method, creating the file while running the JAWS
  application, is given in case you have difficulty with the first three.
 
 Option I:  Download the configuration file from the FTP site.
   1.  Download a file named CPRSChart.JCF from the ANONYMOUS directory.
   2.  Save the file in the ...\SETTINGS\ENU folder under your JAWS 
       folder. (The standard location is C:\JAWS37U\SETTINGS\ENU for JAWS 
       version 3.7 and C:\JAWS40\SETTINGS\ENU for the new JAWS version 4.0.)
   3.  If there is already a file CPRSChart.JCF on the workstation, you 
       probably do not want to overwrite it.  To preserve the current
       settings, you can copy the contents of this file or the 
       [WindowClasses] list from Option II at the bottom of the existing 
       CPRSChart.JCF file.
 
 
 OPTION II: Cut and Paste Information into the Existing Configuration File 
   1. Open CPRSChart.JCF using Notepad. (The standard location for JAWS
     version 3.7 is C:\JAWS37U\SETTINGS\ENU and for the new JAWS
     version 4.0, it is C:\JAWS40\SETTINGS\ENU.)
   2. Copy and paste the following text at the end of the Notepad document:
      [WindowClasses]
      TORComboEdit=EditCombo
      TORListBox=ListBox      
      TORAlignButton=Button
      TORTreeView=TreeView
      TORAlignEdit=Edit
      TORListView=ListView
      TORCheckBox=CheckBox
   3. Save the document. 
  
 Option III:  Create a configuration file by hand.
   1.  Open a blank document using Notepad.
   2.  Cut and paste the following text into the Notepad document:
  
 [WindowClasses]
 TORComboEdit=EditCombo
 TORListBox=ListBox
 TORAlignButton=Button
 TORTreeView=TreeView
 TORAlignEdit=Edit
 TORListView=ListView
 TORCheckBox=CheckBox
  
   3.  Save the document as "CPRSChart.JCF" in your JAWS 
       settings folder.  The standard location of this folder is 
       C:\JAWS37U\SETTINGS\ENU for JAWS version 3.7  or 
       C:\JAWS40\SETTINGS\ENU for the new JAWS version 4.0. Use the quotes
       when entering the file name in Notepad, otherwise Notepad will try to
       save it with a .txt extension.
 
 Option IV:  Make JAWS create the configuration file.
   1. Start JAWS and CPRS.
   2. On the patient selection list box, make sure the cursor is in the edit
      box where you type the patient name.
   3. Press Insert + F2; JAWS will open a dialog called "Run JAWS Manager".
   4. Cursor down to "Window Class Reassign", and select the "OK" button.
   5. JAWS then opens the "JAWS Configuration Manager" and a "Window Classes"
      dialog.
   6. In the "Window Classes" dialog, the "New Class" edit box should read 
      "TORComboEdit".
   7. Go to the "Assign to:" list box, and select "EditCombo".  Then select 
      the "Add Class" button.
   8. The assignment should show up in the "Assigned Classes" list box.
   9. Repeat the above two steps, each time substituting the values below for 
      the "New Class" and "Assign to" entries:
 
 TORListBox             Assign to:      ListBox
 TORAlignButton         Assign to:      Button
 TORTreeView            Assign to:      TreeView
 TORAlignEdit           Assign to:      Edit
 TORListView            Assign to:      ListView
 TORCheckBox            Assign to:      CheckBox
 
   10. When the entire list is entered, select the "OK" button.
   11. JAWS will now use this configuration file when using CPRS, and will 
       recognize the custom controls in CPRS.
 
 
  INSTALLATION FILES:
  =================
  
  
 The following files are available for downloading from the ANONYMOUS 
 directory:
   
     File Name               Contents                      Retrieval Format
     ---------               --------                      ----------------
     CPRSChart.JCF           Configuration File for JAWS        ASCII
     CPRSGUITM.PDF           CPRS GUI Technical Manual          BINARY
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred  
  method is to FTP the files from:  download.vista.med.va.gov.
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
  may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
  follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
