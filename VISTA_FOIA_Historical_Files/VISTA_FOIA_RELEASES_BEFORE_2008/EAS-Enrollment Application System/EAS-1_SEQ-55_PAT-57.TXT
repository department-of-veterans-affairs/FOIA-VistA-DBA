Subject: 1010 EZ PHASE 3 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 EAS*1*57 is an enhancement and modification of Electronic 
 1010EZ Processing.  The enhancement is necessary to keep
 VistA synchronized with changes on the public 1010EZ web
 site and the official, OMB-approved 1010EZ paper form dated
 February 2005.
  
 This patch will install along with DG*5.3*624 - each a part
 of a single host file.  DG*5.3*624 will:
 1.      Create several permanent VistA storage locations for
         1010-related  fields.
 2.      Update the help text of several fields added with
         DG*5.3*597.
 3.      Allow the display and edit of fields added with
         DG*5.3*597 within the Registration, Patient Load/Edit,
         and Means Test options.
 4.      Remove routines, options, and protocols related to
         printing obsolete 1010 forms.
 Please read the patch description of DG*5.3*624 to see the
 registration components added, modified and deleted.  KIDS
 will install DG*5.3*624 before it installs EAS*1*57.
