Description:
============

 The Project Management Division, Health Eligibility Center (HEC) and the 
 Chief Business Office (CBO) are requesting an enhancement to the electronic 
 enrollment process that presumes the care provided to combat veterans is 
 related to the combat experience. This requires a modification to the current 
 VistA application when a provider is prompted to respond whether the care 
 being delivered is related to combat service. The modification presumes 
 combat experience to assure that combat veterans do not pay co-payments for
 health care provided for care of combat-related conditions.  It will also
 eliminate the need for VA providers to annotate that each episode of care
 was related to combat experience, saving time and provider resources.
  
 The Patient Care Encounter (PCE) and Scheduling (SD) applications prompt a 
 user during the completion of encounters with the question, "Was treatment 
 related to Combat?". This question must be answered before the encounter or
 requested service will become active. An affirmative response exempts the 
 veteran from any co-payments for services rendered.  Presently the default
 is "NULL" and must be answered by entry of either YES or NO. It is believed
 that the current process results in an undercount of veterans receiving 
 combat related care. This patch changes the default "NULL" response to "YES". 
  
 This patch SD*5.3*519, along with the Registration patch, DG*5.3*761, is 
 being released in a single KIDS software distribution (Host file) 
 SD_53_P519.KID.
