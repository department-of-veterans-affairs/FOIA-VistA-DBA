Subject: UNKNOWN ACTION STATUS CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000092269
      Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) software errors at line 
      "EN+78^PSBVDLPB" when a BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79) record 
      being processed has its ACTION STATUS field (#.09) equal to "".
      This error occurs when opening up the Virtual Due List (VDL).
      The incomplete record is the result of an administration not
      properly saved when using Manual Medication Entry 
      [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.
  
      Corrective Action:
      BCMA will no longer error when a record with a null action status
      is encountered when opening the VDL. Instead BCMA will send a MailMan
      message to members of the mail group that is specified in the BCMA
      Site Parameter - "Mail Groups/Due List Error", when such a record is
      encountered.  The subject line of this MailMan message will read 
      "BCMA - Admin XXXX Problem". The subject line of this message will 
      contain the Internal Entry Number (IEN), of the entry in the BCMA 
      MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79). PSB*3*11 will allow access to the 
      entry via the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option 
      for correction.  Only users who hold the PSB MANAGER key or the user 
      associated with the entry will be able to access the entry and 
      correct it.  The MailMan message will contain data necessary to 
      access the entry via the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
      ENTRY] option. The following is an example message generated when 
      the ACTION STATUS field (#.09) of an entry in the BCMA MEDICATION 
      LOG file (#53.79) is null.

  Subj: BCMA - Admin 11111 Problem  [#22222222] 07/13/05@13:37  12 lines
  From: JACKSON,TODD ELLIS  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following administration was NOT displayed
    on the Virtual Due List
  
    Order Number....: 21V
    Orderable Item..: HEPARIN SOLN
    Patient.........: BCMAPATIENT,ONE (000-00-9678)
    Ward/Bed........: 7A GEN MED 724-A
    Reason..........: JUL 13, 2005@07:00 admin's ACTION STATUS is "UNKNOWN".
    Schedule........: Q3H
    Action Dt/Tm....: JUL 13, 2005@11:32:50
    BCMA Med Log IEN: 11111
    User............: ( # 00000000000 ) BCMAUSER,ONE
  
  
  
      In the example the entry in the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79) has
      an IEN of 11111.  The specified "User" or a person holding the PSB 
      Manager key may use the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
      ENTRY] option and add a status to the ACTION STATUS field (#.09). 
      The administration which needs an action status added is the
      administration listed in the message, JUL 13,2005@0700, for the
      patient specified in the MailMan message. In the example the patient
      is BCMAPATIENT,ONE.
     
      Exceptions to using the Manual Medication Administration
      [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option are entries with a schedule type of 
      PRO RE NATA (PRN).  A MailMan message triggered by an incomplete 
      administration of a PRN medication must be fixed using VA FileMan.
      The IEN of the entry that needs correction is labeled "BCMA Med Log
      IEN:" within the MailMan message as well as displayed in the MailMan
      message's subject line, immediately after the text "BCMA - Admin".  
      PRN schedule types are an exception because there are no defined
      administration times and the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW
      ENTRY] option is based on scheduled administration times.
  
      It is possible to correct any incomplete BCMA MEDICATION LOG file 
      (#53.79) entry using VA FileMan and the IEN supplied by this MailMan 
      message.
  
  
 2.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000093022
      The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option does not 
      maintain the "Given" status for medication patch administrations on 
      the BCMA VDL.  The user is unable to determine which administered 
      patch must be removed when the VDL does not display the patch as 
      "Given".  
      
      Corrective Action:
      A patch administered via the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG 
      NEW ENTRY] option will show as "Given" on the BCMA VDL.
  
  
 3.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000103739
      The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option 
      malfunctions when attempting to administer an "odd schedule" order 
      on days the order is not scheduled to be administered.
  
      Corrective Action:
      Display appropriate data when "odd schedule" order administrations 
      are attempted.
