Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-071 - This patch MUST be installed before 
 January 1, 2005.  The patch may be installed out of sequence.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for income year 2004 provided 
 in VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-071, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST 
 THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2005 are distributed with this patch.  The 
 updated values for GMT THRESHOLDS file #712.5 are used in the 
 determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year, based 
 on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index.  The geographic based 
 income limits for FY 2004 can be found at: 
 http://www.huduser.org/datasets/il/il04/index.html.
  
 Note that this patch updates the thresholds for the Geographic-Based 
 Means Tests.  Patch DG*5.3*637 will address the annual updates for the 
 Means Test thresholds.
