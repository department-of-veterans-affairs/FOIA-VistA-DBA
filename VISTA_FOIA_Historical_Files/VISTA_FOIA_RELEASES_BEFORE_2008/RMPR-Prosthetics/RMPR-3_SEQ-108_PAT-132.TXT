 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1.  HD153994   Issue with P.O. continuation page
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing a GUI P.O by selecting the VISTA print option or reprinting
 a P.O. on VISTA will cause overflow lines on page one without without 
 skipping to a continuation page with message on first page.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPR4P21 and RMPR4P22 to handle a maximum of 3
 lines on the first page, and if any more than 3 lines skip to the 
 continuation page with a message on first page.  
  
 Added new Deliver To Attention field following Delivery To field
  
 Accounted for contination message if item information overflows the 
 continuation page.
  
  
  
 2. HD161835   Prosthetics Inventory message for ROP levels ignores 
               partially filled orders as outstanding.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The nightly task to identify ROP levels for HCPCS items does not recognize
 partially filled orders or more than 1 outstanding order (only displays 
 last order found).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines RMPR5NU and RMPRPIUD to recognize partially filled
 orders and list all existing orders with ROP message.
  
  
 3. HD162700   Inventory Order Report does not acknowledge partially 
               filled orders and partially filled order cannot later be 
               fully filled with new receipts.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 [PO  Print Order/Receive Item] does not list partially filled orders 
 and a partially filled order cannot later be updated again with a new
 receipt using option [RC  Receive Item from Supply, Vendor or Patient].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRPI09 to list with partially filled orders with the
 outstanding full (not received) orders.
 Modify RMPRPIYY to list for possible selection partially filled orders
 when receiving subsequent quantities.
