   This patch modifies the Input Transform for the EXPIRATION DATE
   sub_field(#3) in the multiple PERSON CLASS field(#8932.1) of the NEW
   PERSON file(#200). The patch also updates the description for the field.
  
   The new Input Transform will prevent the following problems:
   - Users input the EXPIRATION DATE sub_field(#3) less than the EFFECTIVE
     DATE sub_field(#2).
   - Users input the EXPIRATION DATE sub_field(#3) greater than the DATE 
     INACTIVATED field(#4) of inactive Person Class entries in the PERSON
     CLASS file(#8932.1).
  
   Expiration Date field looks like:
   ----------------------------------
   200.05,3      Expiration Date        0;3 DATE
  
      INPUT TRANSFORM:  S %DT="EX" D ^%DT S X=Y I Y<1!'$$ENT^XUA4A73(.D

          LAST EDITED:      MAR 16, 2007 
          HELP-PROMPT:      Last active date. After this date the Person
                            Class is no longer valid. 
          DESCRIPTION:      This field is the date after which this class
                            becomes inactive. This field must be not less
                            than the EFFECTIVE DATE and not greater than
                            the DATE INACTIVATED field(#4) of the Person
                            Class entry in the PERSON CLASS file(#8932.1).
  
                            It will get triggered if a new Person Class is
                            entered or someone edits the field to
                            inactivate the class.
