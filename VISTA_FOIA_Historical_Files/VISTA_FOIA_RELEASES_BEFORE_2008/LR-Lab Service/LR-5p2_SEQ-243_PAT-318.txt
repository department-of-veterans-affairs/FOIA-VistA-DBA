Subject: SUMMARY LIST REPORT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 ***************************************************************
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*318 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*318 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*318 have no effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation 
 of this patch.
 ***************************************************************
  
 Problem #1:
 When an antibiotic sensitivity result is incorrectly input into the system
 and then subsequently deleted, the associated interpretation will still
 display on the Summary List report.   
  
 Problem #2:
 This error occurs when the order entry clerk fails to  make an entry at the 
 SPECIMEN SUBMITTED BY: field when prompted to do so using the 
 option Log-in anatomic path [LRAPLG].  When the summary report 
 [Summary List (extended supervisors')] is executed, the program fails 
 when the record with the blank collection person is processed.  This results
 in a "null subscript" error.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 Problem #1)  BRK-1095-12897 
 ===========================
 1)  BRK-1095-12897 When an antibiotic sensitivity result is incorrectly 
 input into the system and then subsequently deleted, the associated 
 interpretation will still display on the Summary List report.  An 
 interpretation should be paired up with a valid antibiotic sensitivity 
 result on the Summary List report.  When there is no antibiotic 
 sensitivity result, there should not be a displayed interpretation.
 The problem occurs when antibiotics are ordered that should not appear
 on the report. Once sensitivity data has been entered, the technologist 
 must delete the result using the "@" when prompted for a result. When
 the sensitivity is first entered, and the regular microbiology report is 
 generated, a second field is populated called the interpretation field. 
 Both the original sensitivity data and the interpretation data appear on 
 the reports (both the regular microbiology report and the summary list 
 report). When the sensitivity data is deleted the interpretation 
 data remains untouched. The regular microbiology reports ignore this 
 piece of data if the sensitivity data is blank. The Summary List report 
 continues to display the interpretation data on the report.
  
 Resolution #1)
 ===========
 Although the problem with the antibiotic sensitivities was discovered 
 by running the Summary List report, our research indicated that the 
 problem was not with the report routine itself but a reflection of a 
 problem with results entry. We discovered that when the antibiotic 
 sensitivity data is removed using the @ symbol, the interpretation 
 data remains in the global. Our resolution for this is to change 
 the routine (LRMIBUG) used to process manual data entry into 
 antibiotic sensitivities.
  
 Problem #2) ECH-0404-50682 
 ==========================
 2)  ECH-0404-50682 This error occurs when the order entry clerk fails to  
 make an entry at the SPECIMEN SUBMITTED BY: field when 
 prompted to do so using the option Log-in anatomic path [LRAPLG]. 
 When the summary report [Summary List (extended supervisors')] is executed, 
 the program fails when the record with the blank collection person is 
 processed.  This results in a "null subscript" error.
  
 Resolution #2)
 ==============
 LRLISTE was modified to eliminate the possibility of a null subscript 
 error. Rather than having the subscript use a $P of naked reference, the 
 routine now sets up a variable, LRCP, equal to the fifth piece of the full 
 global reference:
 S LRCP=$P(^LR(LRDFN,LRSS(LRAA),LRIDT,0),"^",5).
 If LRCP evaluates to a null, LRCP is set to "UNKNOWN".  This 
 prevents the null subscript error.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 Although this patch may be loaded with users on the system, it is advised
 to install it during non-peak hours.  The install will take less than 10 
 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  [Note: TEXT
      PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text
      only.]
  
  2.  Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*318)
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package LR*5.2*318.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGON during the install? YES//'
      respond NO
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO. 
  
  8.  When prompted to select the protocols that you would like to place
      'out of order', Press Enter since no protocols need to be selected.
  
  9. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion
