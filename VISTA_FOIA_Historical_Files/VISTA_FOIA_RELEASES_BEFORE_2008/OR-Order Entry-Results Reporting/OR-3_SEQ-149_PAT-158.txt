Subject: LOCKING FIX FOR MED CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch fixes two potential patient safety issues with changing 
 medication orders and IV Fluid quick orders, as well as two other problems
 with Inpatient Medication orders.
  
 PROBLEMS and Related NOIS/Remedy#:
 =================================
 1. HD #11167 / CHG #4070  Locking issues between CPRS and Pharmacy
    HD #12188 / CHG #4385
 When orders are being acted on in either CPRS or Pharmacy, the order is 
 to remain locked to prevent another user from taking action on the order 
 at the same time; a loophole was reported in CPRS allowing a pharmacist 
 to finish an order at the same time that a user was changing it in CPRS, 
 which resulted in 2 orders in Pharmacy for the same single order in 
 CPRS.  This has now been fixed, so that once an order has begun to be 
 changed in CPRS no one else may act on the original order until the 
 change order has been signed and released or discontinued.
  
 2. MAR-1201-20370   INPT MED ORDERS DISPLAY IN THE WRONG GROUP
 Prior to this patch, quick orders did not perform all of the usage checks 
 on medications as the regular order dialogs; this allowed IV additives 
 that were unmarked for fluid use, for example, to still be ordered as 
 part of an IV Fluid order via a pre-defined quick order.  This has now 
 been fixed; a future patch will provide a way for orderable items to be 
 specifically flagged in CPRS for quick order use only, so sites may 
 restrict ordering of some items to pre-defined quick orders.
  
 3. BHS-0902-11301   Version 2 Install
    CHG #161
 Prior to this patch, the List Manager interface to CPRS was calling an 
 Inpatient Medications api $$STARTSTP^PSJORPOE inappropriately, for 
 outpatient orders as well as inpatient, which resulted in an undefined 
 error; this is now fixed, so the api will only be called when placing 
 inpatient orders.
  
 4. CLL-0902-42011   UNIT DOSE ORDERS WITH NO PROVIDER
    CHG #4093
 Complex inpatient medication orders are broken into separate orders, one 
 per dose, when signed and released to the Inpatient Medications package; 
 prior to this patch, the ordering provider was only saved with the 
 original 'parent' order containing all the doses, causing the message to 
 Pharmacy to also be missing the provider.  This has now been fixed, and a 
 clean-up routine will be tasked during the post-init to fill in the 
 missing provider information from the parent order.
