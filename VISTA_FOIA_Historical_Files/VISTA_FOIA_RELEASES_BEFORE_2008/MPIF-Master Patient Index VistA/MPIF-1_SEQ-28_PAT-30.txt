Subject: CHANGE ROUTING FOR CMOR CHANGE MSGS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
  of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
  Issue 1: The Health Level Seven (HL7) messages generated when a change to
  the CMOR has been processed currently flows from the CMOR to all the
  sites in the Treating Facility list as well as the Master Patient Index
  (MPI).  This is causing some timing issues because all the other
  messaging flows to the MPI and then out to all the Treating Facilities.  
  The change of CMOR HL7 messages will now flow from the old CMOR to the
  MPI and then out from the MPI to all the sites in the Treating Facility
  list.
  
  Issue 2:  There can be non-Medical Center facilities in the Treating 
  Facility list for a given patient (ie - FHIE, HDR). Only Medical Centers
  can be CMORs. A screen was put in place to ensure that a CMOR isn't
  changed to one of these non-Medical Center facilities.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*30.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) Request  [MPIF CMOR MGR]
         AUTO CHANGE CMOR NIGHT JOB          [MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB]
      
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
