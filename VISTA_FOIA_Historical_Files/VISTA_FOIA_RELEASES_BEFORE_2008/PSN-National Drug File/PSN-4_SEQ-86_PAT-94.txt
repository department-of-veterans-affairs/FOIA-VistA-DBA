Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 NATIONAL DRUG FILE API UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that 
 will be used by calling applications that currently do direct global 
 reads or writes to the National Drug File files.  A review of the 
 previously released APIs showed several entry points where additional 
 pieces of data were required to be returned.
  
 If you have already made code modifications, or have made plans to make
 code modifications to use any of the new APIs, please check the latest
 version of the API manual to verify that the API(s) in question have an
 Active status. The API manual has been modified since the original version
 to indicate Active and Inactive APIs. If the API(s) you need have an
 Inactive status, please contact the Pharmacy Re-Engineering team at the
 Birmingham Field Office.
