Subject: DUPLICATE LABELS WHEN PRINTING FROM SUSPENSE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ****************************** NOTE ******************************
  There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
  Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause 
  any problems.
  ******************************************************************
   When using the option Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] the
   possibility exists that duplicate labels could be printed if
   this option was used previously and is still running.  This patch
   will resolve this issue by delaying the second job until the first
   job finishes.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
 
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*173) 
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*173.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
