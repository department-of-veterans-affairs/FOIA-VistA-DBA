    Problem
    -------
    When using the Third Party Follow-Up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP THIRD
    PARTY] option, it was noticed that when a bill was displayed that was 
    at one time referred to Regional Counsel but then got returned from 
    Regional Counsel, the report was still showing that it was referred - 
    in that it was displaying the REFERRAL REASON CODE (#68.94) field of 
    the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file. This made it difficult to 
    determine which bills were still referred to Regional Counsel and which
    ones were not.
    
    Resolution
    ----------
    Routine IBJDF11 was modified to prevent the REFERRAL REASON CODE
    (#68.94) field from printing on the Third Party Follow-Up Report [IBJD 
    FOLLOW-UP THIRD PARTY] option, if a bill was no longer referred to 
    Regional Counsel.
