 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD 120294     <UNDEFINED>OUTPT+89^IBCEF11
  
  Problem:
  ========
  While the option is copying and cancelling a prescription claim, if no
  soft link exists, the APIs produced the error 
 <UNDEFINED>OUTPT+89^IBCEF11.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  Modified routine IBCEF11 to place the undefined line on the right of the
  FOR command line which is used to search the first prescription
  information, and thus avoid the problem.
