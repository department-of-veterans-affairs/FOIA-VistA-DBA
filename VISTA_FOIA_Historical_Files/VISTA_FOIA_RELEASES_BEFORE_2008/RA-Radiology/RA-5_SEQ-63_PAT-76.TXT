Description:
============

 This patient specific VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine function will 
 return to VistA MPI the exam date/time (in FileMan internal format) of the
 most recent non-cancelled and interpreted case.

 ----
 Return exam date/time for interpreted non-cancelled case.

 VistA Master Patient Index (MPI)                      
  
 Objective
 ---------
 VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine will provide a function that will return
 to VistA MPI the exam date/time (in FileMan internal format) of the most
 recent non-cancelled interpreted case for a specific patient.
  
 Description
 -----------
 This patient specific VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 
 function will return to VistA MPI the exam date/time (in FileMan internal 
 format) of the most recent non-cancelled and interpreted case.  
     
 Please note that an interpreted case usually implies that a provider has 
 transcribed the report. This IA will also consider a "stub" report to be 
 interpreted for the purposes of this IA.  
     
 A "stub" report record in the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS (#74) file has the
 following characteristics:
 (1) The ACTIVITY LOG (#100) indicates that images were collected via VistA
     Imaging 
 (2) The REPORT STATUS (#5) field of the report record is null
 (3) The report record points to an image record in the IMAGE (#2005) file
 (4) No IMPRESSION TEXT (#300) exists for the report record
 (5) No PROBLEM STATEMENT (#25) exists for the report record
 (6) No REPORT TEXT (#200) exists for the report record

 Component (Entry Point)
 -----------------------
 XAMDT
  
 Entry Point Description
 -----------------------
 The XAMDT entry point will be called by the VistA MPI application. VistA
 MPI will provide as input, the DFN of the patient. The VistA
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application will return, in internal VA FileMan
 format, the exam date/time of the most recent non-cancelled interpreted
 case.  
                 
 In the case where the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine is unable to 
 return the exam date/time of the most recent non-cancelled interpreted 
 case the following data string will be returned: "0^an active exam with 
 interpretation was not found for this patient".
  
 Variables:  Input - RADFN
 Input variable description
 --------------------------
 This function requires as input the DFN or record number of the patient.
  
 Variables:  Output - RAXAMDT
 Output variable description
 ---------------------------
 This function returns the exam date/time (in internal VA FileMan format) 
 of the most recent non-cancelled interpreted case.
                             
 In the case where the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine is unable to 
 return the exam date/time of the most recent non-cancelled interpreted 
 case the following data string will be returned: "0^an active exam with 
 interpretation was not found for this patient".

       When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
       YES//", respond YES
  
         When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
         enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med options:
      
         RA*
   
         When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of 
         Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
