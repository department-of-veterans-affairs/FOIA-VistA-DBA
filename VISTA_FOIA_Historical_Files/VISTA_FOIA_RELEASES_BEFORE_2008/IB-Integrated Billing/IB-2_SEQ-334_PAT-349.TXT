 **      ONCE THIS PATCH IS INSTALLED, IT CANNOT BE BACKED OUT!        **
 **                                                                    **
 **  Before installing this patch, you must make sure that your site   **
 **  has a sufficient supply of the new, pre-printed UB-04 claim       **
 **  forms. New forms should be loaded into the default printer(s)     **
 **  for these claim forms at your site. If multiple sites share the   **
 **  same printer for printing claim forms, then this patch must be    **
 **  installed at the same time in each of those sites.                **
 **                                                                    **
 **  Sites are encouraged to review printer set ups (as applicable)    **
 **  to accommodate the printing of the new UB-04 form. See the        **
 **  Pre/Post Installation Overview Instructions in this patch. Sites  **
 **  are STRONGLY encouraged to test the printer set up with the new   **
 **  form in a mirror/test account before installing the software in   **
 **  production.                                                       **
 **                                                                    **
 **  Sites that are using Class III software to interface with         **
 **  Billing/Collection vendor software are responsible for            **
 **  contacting their vendors to ensure compatibility with VA          **
 **  software changes. The vendor(s) may be required to make           **
 **  software changes to ensure a smooth transition to the new         **
 **  UB-04 forms.                                                      **
 **                                                                    **

 Upon installation of this patch, the old UB-92 claim forms may be recycled
 or discarded. Once this patch is installed, it will not be possible to go 
 back and continue to use the old UB-92 claim forms.
  
 This patch also includes the following functionality.
  
 1. Locally printed UB-04 claims will now display a 2 character State, 
    Province or sub-country code (X12 code source 22) when the services on
    the claim are related to an automobile accident. Previously, the     
    user had to be in a HCFA 1500/CMS 1500 or Outpatient UB-92 bill to be
    prompted for the Accident State.
 2. On Billing Screen 8, the free text form locators in section 3, 4 and 
    5 were removed.
 3. Obsolete field PATIENT SHORT MAILING ADDRESS was removed from Billing 
    screen 1. The new UB-04 has provided room for the following Patient 
    Street Address - 40 characters, City - 30 characters, State - 2
    characters, ZIP - 9 characters and Country - 3 characters. The old
    UB-92 only had a total of 50 characters without discrete fields so the
    short address field on Billing Screen 1 provided a place for users to
    enter a short address (47 characters) that could be printed on the
    UB-92. A short address is no longer needed.
 4. On Billing Screen 8, the obsolete Bill Remark field was modified so 
    that a free-text comment can be entered and printed locally on the
    UB-04, FL 80.
 5. Any existing local overrides on the old UB-92 will NOT be carried
    over to the new UB-04. However, these overrides are not being
    deleted. The old UB-92 form type is being archived to a new entry
    in the BILL FORM TYPE file (#353). Therefore, you will be able to
    view any local overrides using the existing Forms Output Utility
    option. If any of these local overrides are needed with the new
    forms, then a new local form will need to be created.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
 --------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000090651  Syntax Code 8888 Invalid Admission Hour
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 HD0000000090651  Syntax Code 8888 Invalid Admission Hour
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Chief Business Office has requested that the validator error 
 generated by Austin, Code 8888  INVALID ADMISSION HOUR, be fixed in 
 VistA by sending "00" as the default admission time for inpatient 
 non-VA (Fee Basis) claims.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. Modified the IB SCREEN4 Input Template to display "12AM" as the 
    default for the NON-PTF ADMISSION HOUR field (#159.5) in the 
    BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) when an admission hour is populated as
    midnight on screen <4> of the Enter/Edit Billing Information option.
  
 2. Modified routine IBCEU to change the default admission hour from 
    99 to 00 if claims have the admission date without the hour. The 
    $$ADMHR function was modified in routine IBCEU.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Both the pre-installation routine and the post-installation routine are
 automatically deleted after this patch is installed.
  
 The pre-installation routine will archive the entry for the old UB-92
 claim form in the BILL FORM TYPE file (#353) and move all of the output
 formatter entries for the old UB-92 to a new entry called LEGACY UB-92.
  
 The pre-installation routine also deletes all of the output formatter data
 entries included with the build as a cleanup so the entries in the build
 get installed cleanly. Finally, some trigger cross reference are deleted
 so that they can be added back with the new field names which were changed
 to reflect the new form.
  
 The post-installation routine performs minor housekeeping items such as 
 setting default value for UB PRINT LEGACY ID parameter, removing the PRINT
 '001' FOR TOTAL CHARGES? field, recompiling some billing screen input
 templates, and updating some file descriptions.
  
  
 Printer Set-up Information and Example
 --------------------------------------
 The NUBC designed the UB-04 claim form to be 82 characters wide at 10 
 characters per inch (cpi) and 63 lines per page at 6 lines per inch.  
 These are the same specifications as the existing UB-92 claim form which 
 is being replaced. However, VistA implemented the UB-92 claim form using 
 only 80 characters per line. This was possible because the UB-92 claim 
 form simply had more room in the boxes. The UB-04 claim form is much 
 tighter and it is not possible to print the form using only 80 characters 
 per line.
  
 Therefore, the VistA implementation of the UB-04 claim form calls for the
 full 82 characters per line at 10 cpi.
  
 One problem that was discovered is that most standard printers in use 
 today can only print 8 inches wide when using the PCL5 printer programming
 language which VistA uses to communicate with the printers. The UB-04
 claim form requires a printed width of 8.2 inches (82 characters at 10
 cpi) or about 8 3/16".
  
 There are printers that can support what is known as "Edge-to-Edge" 
 printing where the horizontal margins can be as small as 2 millimeters.  
 In order to print the UB-04 claim form with the full 82 columns of data 
 using PCL5, we have found that it is necessary to use this "Edge-to-Edge" 
 printing feature.
  
 There are various ways to turn on "Edge-to-Edge" printing for those 
 printers that support it. This patch description documents the methods 
 that we have discovered.
  
  
 HP Printers
 -----------
 There is an HP documented PCL5 command called User Defined Logical Page.  
 It does not work in all HP printers, but it works in some of them. Here 
 is the command.
  
    $C(27),"&a10W",$C(0,108,0,0,0,0,23,16,30,240)
  
 The above command defines a logical page with a Left edge offset of 108 
 decipoints, or .15 inches, a logical page width of 5904 decipoints, or 8.2
 inches, and a logical page height of 7920 decipoints, or 11 inches.
  
 When used as a part of the OPEN EXECUTE field of the Terminal Type entry,
 and when used in printers that support this command, this command allows
 for the printing of 82 characters per line at 10 cpi.
  
  
 Lexmark Printers
 ----------------
 For certain models of Lexmark printers, there is a printer setting called 
 "Print Area" which modifies the logical and physical printable area.  
 There are three possible values: Normal, Fit to Page, and Whole Page.  
 Normal is the default setting. For printing the UB-04 claim form, this 
 should be set to be Whole Page. The Whole Page setting only affects 
 pages printed using the printer's PCL5 interpreter.
  
 Here are instructions for changing this Print Area setting for a Lexmark 
 T644 printer. If you have a different model of Lexmark printer, please 
 refer to your printer's documentation regarding Menus and Messages.
  
 To change printer settings on a Lexmark T644:
  
   - Press the menu button located on the front of the printer panel
   - Use the navigation buttons on the printer panel to scroll up or down
     thru the various options
   - A check mark will appear next to the options as you scroll through
     them
   - Scroll to the 'settings' option
   - Press the 'select' button (indicated with a check mark) on the
     printer panel
   - Scroll again to locate the 'setup menu' option
   - Press 'select' button
   - Scroll again to locate the 'print area' option
   - Press 'select' button
   - Scroll thru to find the 'whole page' option
   - Press 'select' button
  
 It is also possible to remotely edit the Lexmark printer settings using 
 the printer's IP address and a web browser if the printer was set up with 
 this functionality. The menu path may be different depending on the 
 model#. The Print Area setting is on the Setup Menu which is found by 
 clicking on 'Configuration' or 'Printer Settings' or similar.
  
 Important Note about the Lexmark "Whole Page" setting:  This setting 
 affects all printed output from that printer. So if you are using the 
 same Lexmark printer to print UB-04's and CMS-1500's and plain paper 
 output, then all output will be affected. You will need to use the left 
 edge offset registration command for your plain paper output to shift the 
 output to the right if you discover that the first 2-3 characters are 
 being clipped after making the "Whole Page" setting. If this happens, 
 then shifting the output to the right about 1/4" is all you need to do.  
 This command is $C(27),"&l180U". 180 decipoints is equal to 1/4".
  
  
 Other Printers
 -------------- 
 Please note that IRM staff must investigate ways to enable Edge-to-Edge 
 printing on your specific claim form printer. Some printers are not 
 capable of printing Edge-to-Edge and it is not possible to print wider 
 than 8 inches using PCL5. These printers will have to be replaced in 
 order to successfully print the UB-04 claim form.
  
  
 Example Device and Terminal Type Entries
 ----------------------------------------
 Please set the right margin for the UB-04 device/terminal type to 82.
 We have found that the FORM FEED value should be $C(12) rather than #.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal working
 hours when no Integrated Billing users are on the system. However, if
 installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the following
 selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
         Print Bill                           [IB PRINT BILL]
         Print Authorized Bills               [IB BATCH PRINT BILLS]

 **** Do not install this patch when the IB MT NIGHT COMP background job
      is running.
  
 **** Again, do not install this patch until the new UB-04 claim forms
      have been loaded into the appropriate printers.
  
 Also, make sure that electronic claims are NOT scheduled to be transmitted
 via TaskManager while the patch is being installed. It's best to check
 with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB Site Parameter file (#350.9) that may
 contain specific times to transmit bills.
  
 Any future tasks set up in TaskManager based on the field HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) field in the IB Site Parameter file (#350.9) would
 appear similar to this:
  
  5310003: FORMOUT^IBCEFG7, OUTPUT FORMATTER - FORM: IB 837 TRANSMISSION.
           No device.  ACT,ACT.  From Today at 1:01,  By you.
           Scheduled for Today at 16:00
  
 If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will be
 transmitted when the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT
 COMP] job runs.
