Description:
============

  NOTE:  This patch will be released with Registration patch DG*5.3*709
  DATE FORMATS FOR DISABILITIES in host file DVB_4_P57.KID. Please see the
  National Patch Module patch description for DG*5.3*709 for details
  concerning the functionality of that patch. In order to install the host
  file, please follow the instructions listed below, under INSTALLATION
  INSTRUCTIONS.
  
  This patch, DVB*4.0*57, addresses several issues.
  
  1. The first issue is described in Remedy ticket #HD0000000120178. A
  single user at one site reported that when the HINQ returned an error
  message indicating that the identifying number submitted was not found in
  the VBA database, the user's HINQ password was included in the error
  message. This occurred because this user's password contained a string 
  for which the code was checking. This patch will correct the problem.
  
  2. A second issue was identified in the patch tracking message for
  DVB*4*49 HINQ Replacement - Interim Solution. For a new field in the
  PATIENT #2 file, RATED DISABILITIES (VA) #2.04 multiple, EXTREMITY
  AFFECTED #4, there is an error in the external value of one of the codes.
  This patch will correct the problem.
  
  3. This issue is unreported. Two new date fields in the PATIENT #2 file,
  RATED DISABILITIES #2.04 subfile, ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE #5, and
  CURRENT EFFECTIVE DATE #6 are incorrectly using FileMan internal format
  (example:  3060207) rather than external format (Feb 7,2006) in the
  HINQUP features [DVB HUPLOAD-MENU] option. The other patch included in
  host file build DVB_4_P57.KID, DG*5.3*709, corrects the same problem with
  these two fields on Registration screen 11 (see patch description for
  DG*5.3*709).
  
  4. It was reported that the option used by IRM personnel to check the
  HINQ connection does not work. The option is HINQ Transaction Test [DVB
  HREQ-TRANSTEST]. This option is being modified to address the same port
  number as the regular HINQ functionality. This issue is reported in
  Remedy ticket #HD0000000123434.
  
  5. When HINQ requests do not return patient information, the response
  contains an error code. Currently users cannot differentiate between
  error conditions when the user is not assigned as an authorized HINQ
  user and when the user has entered an invalid password. A new code,
  "User not assigned to the HINQ application" is being added and will be
  put into production by the Austin Automation Center once this patch has 
  been installed at all sites. Until the new code is deployed, users will
  continue to see a message that does not differentiate between the two
  error conditions. This was reported in Remedy ticket #HD0000000122873.
  
  
  SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL
  ==================
  
  The software for this patch is not being distributed through the National
  Patch Module. That is because this patch is being distributed as a host
  file. The host file will contain the following two KIDS builds:
  
                  Host file name:     DVB_4_P57.KID
  
                          Builds:     DVB*4.0*57
                                      DG*5.3*709
  
  Sites may retrieve the software directly using FTP from the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field Offices:

 *NOTE:  If your site is one of the ones that installed the two patches 
  that have been marked ENTERED IN ERROR (DVB*4*54 and DG*5.3*693), your 
  Before Patch checksums will not match the numbers listed above in the 
  Before Patch column. They should, however, match the numbers listed 
  above in the After Patch column. This means that if your site installed 
  DVB*4*54 and DG*5.3*693, when you now install (the host file build for) 
  DVB*4*57 and DG*5.3*709, the Before and After checksums for each routine 
  will stay the same.
