Description:
============

 This patch is the Patient Care Encounter(PCE) part of Clinical Indicator
 Data Capture (CIDC) project.  There are no NOIS messages or E3Rs
 associated with this patch.
  
 Overview
 ========
 Patient Care Encounter(PCE) has been identified by the Clinical
 Indicators Data Capture(CIDC) Team as one of the systems that needs to
 be modified in order to send the required data at the optimal time to
 improve the billing process, and thus improve VHA's revenue collection
 process.  The patch PX*1.0*124 represents the PCE portion of the CIDC
 effort of Revenue Improvement.
   
  
 Functional Description
 ======================
 Modifications to the VHA Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package have been made such that the
 Integrated Billing(IB) package be able to distinguish billable from
 non-billable patient care events.  The modifications include:
  
  
 * All diagnoses entered into PCE shall be identified as being Service 
   Connected or Non-service connected, and where appropriate, be 
   classified with Combat Veteran, Environmental indicators, Military
   Sexual Trauma, and Head and Neck Cancer.  The legacy requirement that
   Environmental Indicator classification questions will not be asked
   when the Service Connection is true, is in effect for diagnoses.
  
 * All procedure codes will be identified as having clinical indicators
   which shall be selectable from the VISTA diagnosis list.  
  
 * The changes above will be made to both the interactive PCE 
   functionality as well as the non-interactive Application Programmer 
   Interface(API) driven functionality.
  
 * The Encounter level Service Connection Indicator together with the
   other encounter classifications: Agent Orange exposure, Irradiation
   exposure, Environmental Contaminants, Military Sexual Trauma, Head
   and/or Neck Cancer, Combat Vet, known collectively as the
   SC/EI classification, shall be auto-populated.
   
  
 Technical Description
 ======================
 This patch PX*1.0*124 implements the following functionality: 
  
 1) Enhances the PCE Procedure File to include diagnoses which are 
  associated with the PCE procedures.   
  
 2) Enhances the PCE Diagnosis File to include an Ordering/Resulting field.  
    
 3) Enhances the PCE Immunization File to include diagnoses which are 
  associated with the PCE immunizations.  
  
 4) Enhances the PCE Skin Test File to include diagnoses which are 
  associated with the PCE skin tests.  
  
 5) Enhances the Visit File to include Classification Edit Flags
  
 6) Makes changes to the data filing API's DATA2PCE(IA 1889) and PXCA
  (IA 1899) to enable the use of the new CPT Diagnosis fields and the
     new Diagnosis Classification fields.
  
 7) The Encounter level SC/EI classifications will be auto-populated
   according to the following rules:
  
   If the SC/EI for at least one ICD-9 is "Yes" the Encounter Level
   SC/EI will automatically be set to "Yes" regardless of whether the
   Encounter Level SC (or EI) was previously populated
   ("Yes", "No" or Null).
         
   If the SC/EI for all ICD-9s are "No" the Encounter Level SC/EI will
   automatically be set to "No" regardless of whether the Encounter
   Level SC/EI was previously populated ("Yes", "No" or Null).
         
   If at least one ICD-9 is missing SC/EI determination and none of the
   other ICD-9s SC/EI determination is "Yes" do not change the SC/EI
   determination of the Encounter level.
    
 8) An error in PXAIPL was corrected to treat the PL ADD parameter
   correctly in the DATA2PCE call.  The error was that all diagnoses
   were being sent to the problem list, and not only those with
   PL ADD set to 1. Further, when the diagnosis was sent to the
   problem list without a provider, the problem list was erroring
   with a provider class error.
   
 9) An error in the primary/secondary determination in PXAIPRV was
   corrected.  The error incorrectly warned that a provider was identified
   as primary.
  
 10) Changes made to support the DATA2PCE API 
   a)  The DATA2PCE API now accepts the seven additional Procedure
   Clinical Indicators DIAGNOSIS 2, DIAGNOSIS 3, DIAGNOSIS 4,
   DIAGNOSIS 5, DIAGNOSIS 6, DIAGNOSIS 7, and DIAGNOSIS 8. The results
   are stored in the V CPT (#9000010.18) file for the encounter.  Support
   for the Skin Test and Immunization files are supported through
   the Code mapping file (#811).  The following routine was  modified to
   support the additional functionality:  PXAICPT
   b)  The DATA2PCE API now accepts "P" AND "S" for Primary and Secondary 
   Diagnosis as well as 1 and 0.   The following routines were either 
   modified or added to support the additional functionality: PXAIPOV 
   c)  Typographical errors were corrected in routine PXAIPRV in the TMP 
   subscript 812 and in routine PXAIVSTV for OUTSIDE LOCATION. Changes
   were made to fix warning errors for primary/secondary designations.
   d)  A change was made to PXAIPL to fix an error in the PL ADD
   parameter.  The PL ADD parameter was being ignored.
   e)  The following additions/modifications were made to the DATA2PCE
   parameters:
