Subject: MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS ASSIGNMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
 Field: MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS(#5) in File: SECURITY KEY(#19.1) now allows
 key management personnel to:
  
 1.  Enter a security key that should not be given to anyone,
 see example #1.
  
 2.  Or should not be held with another security key(s), see example #2.
  
 3.  Option:Enter/Edit of Security Keys [XUKEYEDIT] has been revised to
 allow input of the Field: MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS(#5) in File: SECURITY
 KEY(#19.1). For example using the Security Key 'XM GROUP EDIT MASTER':
  
 NAME: XM GROUP EDIT MASTER
  DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Edit other users' mail groups
  DESCRIPTION:   People who need to be able to edit other users' mail
  groups and add new users to them should be assigned this key.  
   
  Holders of this key may edit any mail group, except personal mail 
  groups.  (Personal mail groups are those which only the organizer may
  edit or use.) 
   
  The following users should NOT be given this key, because they already
  possess the privilege this key grants: 
   - Holders of the XMMGR key.  
   - Clinical Application Coordinators, as identified in file 8930, USR
     Class, belonging to the TIU package.  
  
  
 Select Key Management Option: ENter/Edit of Security Keys
  
 Select SECURITY KEY NAME: XM GROUP EDIT MASTER  
 DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Edit other users' mail groups  Replace

 DESCRIPTION:. . .
        . . .
 Holders of this key may edit any mail group, except personal mail
 groups.  (Personal mail groups are those which only the organizer
 may edit or use.)
  
 The following users should NOT be given this key,
 because they already possess the privilege this key grants:
  - Holders of the XMMGR key.
  - Clinical Application Coordinators, as identified in file 8930,
 USR Class, belonging to the TIU package.
  
   Edit? NO// 
 Select SUBORDINATE KEY: 
 GRANTING CONDITION: 
 Select MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS: XMMGR  
   Are you adding 'XMMGR' as a new MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS (the 1ST for 
 this SECURITY KEY)? No// Y (Yes)
 Select MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS:
  
 4.  Finally a New option [XUEXKEY]:
  Allocate/De-Allocate Exclusive Key(s) [XUEXKEY]
              **> Locked with XUEXKEY
 has been created to allow Allocation and De-Allocation of a Mutually
 Exclusive key(s) to a primary key.  This option has been added to the 'Key
 Management [XUKEYMGMT]' and requires that the 'Security Key' XUEXKEY to be
 allocated before it can be accessed.  For example:
  
 Select Key Management Option:  Allocate/De-Allocate Exclusive Key(s)
 Select Primary Allocated Key(s): ZZKEN1  
 Select MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS: ZZKEN1  
   Are you adding 'ZZKEN1' as a new MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS (the 1ST for 
 this SECURITY KEY)? No// Y (Yes)
  
 Select MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE KEYS: 
  
 Example #1:
 ===========
 To allow a key NOT to be accessed by any user, set the primary key
 Exclusive to itself.  An example would be setting key 'ZZKEN1' as
 Mutually Exclusive Key to 'ZZKEN1', any attempt to give this key to a
 user will result in the below message being displayed:
  
 "Key 'ZZKEN1' may not be given to any user at this time no action
 taken"
  
 Select Key Management Option: Allocation of Security Keys
 Allocate key: ZZKEN1  
 Another key: 
 Holder of key: ORMSBY,SKIP       SO       
 Another holder: 
 You've selected the following keys: 
 ZZKEN1
 You've selected the following holders: 
 ORMSBY,SKIP
 You are allocating keys.  Do you wish to proceed? YES// 
 ZZKEN1 being assigned to:
      ORMSBY,SKIP
 Key 'ZZKEN1' may not be given to any user at this time no action taken
  
 Example #2:
 ===========
 Using the 'XM GROUP EDIT MASTER' key as an example, by setting the
 Mutually Exclusive field with 'XMMGR', the user will not be able to be
 given access to both keys simultaneously.  Should any attempt be made to
 assign the 'XM GROUP EDIT MASTER' key to a user that has already been
 assigned the key 'XMMGR', the following message will be displayed:
  
  "You are not AUTHORIZED key 'XM GROUP EDIT MASTER' with EXCLUSIVE key
 'XMMGR' no action taken"
  
  
 Select Key Management Option: Allocation of Security Keys
 Allocate key: XM GROUP EDIT MASTER
 Another key: 
 Holder of key: ORMSBY,SKIP     SO       
 Another holder: 
 You've selected the following keys: 
  
 XM GROUP EDIT MASTER
  
 You've selected the following holders: 
  
 ORMSBY,SKIP
  
 You are allocating keys.  Do you wish to proceed? YES// 
  
 XM GROUP EDIT MASTER being assigned to:
      ORMSBY,SKIP
  
 You are not AUTHORIZED key 'XM GROUP EDIT MASTER' with EXCLUSIVE key 
 'XMMGR' no action taken
