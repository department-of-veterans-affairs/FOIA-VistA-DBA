Description:
============

  PLEASE NOTE:
  ============
  Austin Master Patient Index patch MPI*1*40 constitutes a change in
  the business process that updates the patient identity fields across
  VA facilities.  That patch will phase out the use of the facility
  Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) concept, and introduce the 
  Primary View methodology.  Primary View is an enterprise view of
  the most current data for a patient based on authority scoring and
  the latest data rules.
    
  Austin patch MPI*1*40 is scheduled for installation on the Master
  Patient Index on Saturday, March 24, 2007.  Patch MPIF*1*46 must be
  installed at all facilities prior to that, to enable the
  installation of MPI*1*40 on schedule.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*41 and MPIF*1.0*44 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*46.
   
  Issue #1
  When MPI*1*40 is in production on the Austin MPI, hard errors can occur 
  on the VistA side when IMDQ uses the Mismatched Patient Record Resolution
  option on the MPI.  The issue is related to code in MPIFA43 not properly
  handling the HL7 PID segment when it is greater than 245 characters.  
  Routine MPIFA43 was changed to address this.
   
  Issue #2
  An inadvertent issue was introduced in patch MPIF*1.0*44.  Prior to
  that patch, the MPI's Application Programmer Interface (API) in
  routine MPIFAPI prompted for identity fields in the first part of
  PIMS Registration options for new patients.  In patch MPIF*1.0*44,
  a change in the program structure caused the API not to prompt for those
  fields for new patients unless a specific field in a future DG patch was
  present.  This has been corrected in routine MPIFAPI.
    
  Issue #3
  Within the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  a change has been made to the screen that restricts the action taken
  for Potential Matches Returned exceptions.  In the future, when
  MPI*1*40 is in production on the Austin MPI, this new screen will
  prevent Primary View Reject exceptions from entering the Potential
  Matches Returned logic.  Routine MPIFDUP addresses this issue.
   
  Issue #4
  Within the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  the Exception Text for the new Primary View Reject exceptions has
  been changed as per IMDQ request.  Routine MPIFA31B addresses this issue.
