Subject: 1010EZ Online Processing Phase 2.5

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
         ======================= General =======================
  
 EAS*1*51 is an enhancement and modification of Electronic 1010EZ 
 Processing.  The enhancement is necessary to keep VistA synchronized with 
 changes on the public 1010EZ web site and the official, OMB-approved 
 1010EZ paper form.  
  
 This patch will install along with DG*5.3*597 - each a part of a single 
 host file.  DG*5.3*597 creates several permanent VistA storage locations 
 for 1010-related fields.  Please read the patch description of DG*5.3*597 
 to see the fields added.  KIDS will install DG*5.3*597 before it installs 
 EAS*1*51.
  
 Changes revolve around the data elements collected, filed, and printed.  
 There are no changes to the functional flow of existing 1010EZ 
 processes.  The data elements of in-process 1010EZ applications received 
 prior to installation of this patch will be displayed, filed, and printed 
 as before.  1010EZ applications received after installation of this patch 
 will display, file, and print the updated list of data elements.
  
  
         ================ Data Element Changes =======================
  
 Certain new data elements will be added to file 711 (1010EZ Mapping)
 for collection, display, updating, filing, and printing.  They include:

 Note #1:  Receipt of Nose and Throat Radium Treatments will be captured 
 on the online 1010EZ application, but EAS*1*51 shall not file the data 
 into VistA since additional nose and throat data, which is not collected 
 on the online 1010EZ, is required to correctly file the information.
  
 Note #2:  The new online 1010EZ will allow the collection of 4 additional 
 Health Insurance policies for the patient and EAS*1*51 shall file the 
 associated data elements for up to 4 additional Health Insurance policies 
 in the Insurance Buffer File.
  
 Note #3:  The total amount itself for children 1 thru 19 for 
 Farm/Business Income shall not be filed into VistA, instead the 
 individual amounts for children 1 thru 19 are filed.
  
 Note #4:  The new 1010EZ will allow the collection of financial data for 
 up to 19 children.  EAS*1*51 shall file the Gross Annual Income data for 
 each child separately.
  
 Note #5: The individual amounts for children 1 thru 19 for 
 Assets/Previous Year Net Income shall not be filed into VistA, instead 
 the total amounts for children 1 thru 19 are filed with the net income 
 amount of the Veteran.
  
 Note #6:  The new 1010EZ will allow the collection of financial data for 
 up to 19 children.  EAS*1*51 shall file the total of Previous Calendar 
 Year Net Worth amounts for all the children added into the Net Worth 
 amount of the Veteran.
  
 Note #7:  The total amount itself for children 1 thru 19 for Gross Annual 
 Income shall not be filed into VistA, instead the individual amounts for 
 children 1 thru 19 are filed.
  
 Certain existing data elements are considered obsolete and will not 
 continue to be collected.  The entries in file 711 (1010EZ Mapping) will 
 remain active so 'old' in process applications can be displayed, filed, 
 and printed as before.  They include:

 Data elements not included in either list above remain as already defined 
 within the 1010EZ package.
  
 Note #8:  The new online 1010EZ application will no longer offer 
 "Enrollment" as a selection for question "Type of Benefit(s) Applied 
 For".  This field shall not be filed by EAS*1*51 because it is part of 
 Registration.  For the same reason, this field is not filed by the 
 existing EAS routine(s).
  
 Note #9:  The new online 1010EZ application will no longer ask "Does the 
 Spouse have Health Insurance (Other than Medicare) Y/N".  This field shall 
 not be filed by EAS*1*51 because health insurance coverage is determined 
 by the IB and Insurance Buffer File routines.  For the same reason, this 
 field is not filed by the existing EAS routine(s).
  
 Note #10:  This was an instructional (Yes/No) statement that will no 
 longer be presented on the new online 1010EZ application.  Please note 
 the new Farm/Bus. Income item:  It collects actual dollar figures rather 
 than Yes/No.
  
  
         ================ Display Changes =======================
  
 There have been minor modifications to the help text available when a 
 user attempts to update certain display only total child income (Ch+) and 
 individual child asset amounts.
  
 There have been minor modifications (for consistency) to certain display 
 names within the interface.
