Description: 
============

  When using the List Manager choice EP  Edit Parameter Grp., in the option
  IBDF SETUP AUTO CLINIC PRINT [Setup Automatic Print Queues], the device can
  be entered using lower case.  The lookup on the Device (#3.5) file appears
  to be successful.  But, what is actually saved in the PRINT MGR'S QUEUING
  PARAM NAME (#11) multiple, field DEVICE (#.09) of the ENCOUNTER FORM
  PARAMETERS (#357.09) file is the lower case device name entered by the user.
  The DEVICE (#3.5) file's NAME (#.01) field value should have been stored
  instead.  This patch will correct this.
