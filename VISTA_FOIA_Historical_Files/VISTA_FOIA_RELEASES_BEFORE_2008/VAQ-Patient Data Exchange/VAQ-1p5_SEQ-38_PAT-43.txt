Subject: EXISTING PATIENT CHECK DURING ADD NEW PATIENT PROCESS AND DR VARIABLE LEAKAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will prevent a new patient from being added to the Patient (#2)
 file if an existing patient with the same SSN exists.  It also corrects a
 DR variable leak.
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================
 1. RIC-0202-20894     PDX failure to delete PATIENT entry
 2. ISP-0504-N0567     DR ARRAY VARIABLE LEAKAGE

 TEST SITES:

    Anchorage, AK
  
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. RIC-0202-20894     PDX failure to delete PATIENT entry
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem reported is that data is not being cleaned up properly when
    Patient Data Exchange (PDX) fails to add a new patient to the PATIENT
    (#2) file.  PDX uses the FileMan call FILE^DICN to add new patients to
    the PATIENT (#2) file.  If, during this process it is determined that
    the entry is not new (based on the SSN), the add is aborted.
    Unfortunately, some triggers are already fired in the PATIENT (#2) file
    and these are not cleaned up, leaving invalid entries.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This problem will be resolved by checking for an existing SSN, in the
    SSN cross-reference ^DPT("SSN", prior to making the FileMan call to add
    a new patient.  If an existing SSN (not including pseudo SSNs) is found,
    the add a new patient process will be aborted and the message
    "** Patient not added, SSN in use by existing patient" will be
    displayed.
    
 2. ISP-0504-N0567     DR ARRAY VARIABLE LEAKAGE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The DR variable array is not newed/killed in the PDX API before the
    first Fileman call of ^DIE.  This was discovered while working on a
    NOIS involving the Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP
    BATCH] option.  The leakage occurred with a patient with 2 transactions
    to send.  During the second transaction, the DR array variable is setup
    in routine PPPPDX1 which calls the PDX^VAQUIN01 API.  These DR array
    settings are still around when the first ^DIE call is made in the
    Patient Data Exchange software.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The DR variable will be "Newed" in routine VAQUIN01 to fix this
    problem.  By "Newing" the DR variable in this routine, we prevent any
    further leakage of DR from other packages which may use the
    PDX^VAQUIN01 supported reference.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system.  This patch should not
 be installed while the Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP
 BATCH] option is running.  Installation time will be less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation

           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options

      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when

          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      VAQ*1.5*43.
  
      a.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//", answer NO.
      b.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu 
          Options and Protocols? YES//", answer YES.
      c.  When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':",
