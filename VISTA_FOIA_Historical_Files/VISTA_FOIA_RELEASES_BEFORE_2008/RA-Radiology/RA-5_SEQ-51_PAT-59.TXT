Subject: PERFORMANCE MEASURE CALC CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Routine RAPM1 has been changed to use the initial report verification 
 date in calculating the time elapsed to verification of an amended report.  
 Previously, the last verification date was used and this caused an 
 inflation of the time elapsed to verification.  This change affects the 
 Summary/Detail report [RA PERFORMIN RPTS] option under the Daily 
 Management Reports menu.

 ===============     
 HD0000000084587 Performance Measure Calculations - Correct Calculation
      
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ==============
      
 Problem  
 -------
 The output from the Summary/Detail report [RA PERFORMIN RPTS] option is 
 incorrectly showing the most recent report verification date.  If the
 report has been unverified and then reverified the report will reflect
 the most recent verification instead of the initial verification date.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RAPM1 to quit at the correct time
 to ensure that initial verification date is used.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
      
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.
      
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
      
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RA*5.0*59)
      
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     RA*5.0*59.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
      
  8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
