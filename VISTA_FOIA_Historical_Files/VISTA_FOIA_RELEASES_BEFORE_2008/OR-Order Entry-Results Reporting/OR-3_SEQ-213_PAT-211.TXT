Description:
============

 [PSI-03-047]: This patch adds CPRS support for contrast media changes
 introduced by Radiology patch RA*5*45.  The changes to the Contrast Media
 field of the Orderable Items file include the description modification as
 follows:
  
   OLD (pre OR*3*211):
       M = unspecified contrast media
       C = cholecystogram
       B = barium
  
   NEW (post OR*3*211):
       I = Ionic Iodinated
       N = Non-Ionic Iodinated
       L = Gadolinium
       C = Cholecystographic
       G = Gastrografin
       B = Barium
       M = Unspecified contrast media
  
 Changes to affected CPRS order checks include:
 BIOCHEM ABNORMALITY FOR CONTRAST MEDIA
 GLUCOPHAGE-CONTRAST MEDIA
 The order check logic for these order checks will now look for orders placed
 using an orderable item which contains an intravenous (iodinated) contrast 
 media code of  M, I, or N. In addition, the order check messages have been 
 changed from "Procedure uses non-barium contrast media..." to "Procedure 
 uses intravenous contrast media...".
 
 ALLERGY-CONTRAST MEDIA INTERACTION
 This order check has been modified to use the new contrast media 
 codes.  The order check logic now looks for orders placed using an
 orderable item which contains a contrast media code of I,N,L,C,G,B,M.
 This order check message has also been changed to list what type of
 contrast media is associated with the procedure being ordered as follows:
 
 "Patient allergic to contrast media. This procedure uses: <contrast media
 type>"
 
  
 Testing:
 Locate entries in your Orderable Item file [#101.43] which use the new 
 contrast media codes.  These can be located by looking at the CONTRAST 
 MEDIA field.  Enter orders using those orderable items for patients 
 actively taking a form of metformin (glucophage.)  Repeat the test for 
 patients with a biochemical abnormality (abnormally high or low renal lab
 results: serum creatinine or serum urea nitrogen.)
