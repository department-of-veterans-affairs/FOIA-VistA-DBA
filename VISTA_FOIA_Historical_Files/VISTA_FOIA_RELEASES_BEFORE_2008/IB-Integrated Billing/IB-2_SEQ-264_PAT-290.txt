 After release of the EDI Enhancement patch (IB*2*232) that converted the 
 VistA electronic claims to HIPAA compliant format, an issue was identified
 regarding the printing of the provider's SSN on the claims.
  
 The Central Business Office (CBO) has requested that a change be made to
 the VistA software for locally printed claims so they do not print the
 provider's SSN as a default provider ID. This patch will change the local
 printing of claim forms to print the V.A.'s UPIN number (VAD000) on the
 UB92 if no default secondary ID is found for all performing providers. For
 the HCFA 1500 claim forms, this patch will change the local printing of
 the referring provider ID to print the UPIN number(VAD000) for the
 referring provider if no other default secondary provider ID is found.
  
  The print form locators affected by this change are:
  
          UB92: PERFORMING PROVIDER ID data in form locators 82 and 83   
     HCFA 1500: REFERRING PROVIDER ID data in box 17A
   
  
 Technical Description:
 ---------------------- 
  
 For the UB92 locally printed claim form, the code that formatted and
 defaulted the SSN as the secondary provider ID for boxes 82 and 83 was
 modified in routine BOX82NM^IBCEU4. This code was also modified to restore
 the printing of the current provider's secondary ID along with the
 provider's name.  This latter functionality was inadvertently removed by
 patch IB*2*155 (MRA). The output formatter file entries changed for this
 were #614, #623, #630, #631, #633, #635 in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT
 (#364.7) file.
  
 For the HCFA 1500 printed claim, the code that defaulted and printed the
 SSN as the referring provider ID in box 17A was modified in routine
 DEFID^IBCEF74.  The output formatter file entry changed for this was #353
 in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should be installed after normal working hours when no 
 Integrated Billing users are using the system. Install Time - 2 minutes or
 less. Other VISTA users will not be affected.  The following menus/options
 should be disabled prior to the start of the installation:
  
         Integrated Billing Master Menu [IB MANAGER MENU] 
         Billing Supervisor Menu [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR MENU]
         Billing Clerk's Menu [IB BILLING CLERK MENU]
  
 Also, make sure the auto-transmit of electronic claims option (Queue 
 Auto Transmit EDI Bills [IBCE 837 AUTO TRANSMIT]) is not scheduled to run 
 while the patch is being installed.  It's best to check with your Billing 
 section on this.  There is an IB Site Parameter (file #350.9) called HOURS
 TO TRANSMIT BILLS (field #8.06) that may contain specific times to
 transmit bills.  If there are no specific times set up in this parameter,
 claims will be transmited when the [IB MT NIGHT COMP] job runs.
