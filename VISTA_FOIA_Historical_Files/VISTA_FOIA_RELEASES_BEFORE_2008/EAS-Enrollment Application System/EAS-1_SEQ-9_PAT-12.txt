Subject: APPT BLOCKING DOM MODIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the following NOIS issues:
  
 DUB-0502-30203 - Domiciliary staff are unable to checkout a patient for 
 an appointment because a means test is required. Patient's anniversary 
 date is over a year old.
  
 BIL-0502-30373 - Same problem with domiciliary patients as DUB-0502-30203 
  
 CLL-0502-40647 - Since loading the Auto Means Test menu the Means Test 
 Clerk has noticed that the appointments tied to the patients in our DOM 
 ward cannot be checked in or checked out.  The DOM patients are to be 
 exempt from completing a means test until they are discharged from the 
 DOM.
  
 NJH-0502-20682 - NJ is having a problem checking in or out DOM patients.  
 We have checked the admitting regulation in bed control and found that it 
 is correct.   This appears to be the same issue as in NOIS 
 CLL-0502-40647.  We request immediate assistance as we have over 125 
 patients in our DOM.
  
 PUG-0402-52675 - The Automated MT Letters Summary Report expects the 
 comment field to be filled in for the means test returned information.
  
 TAM-0502-30215 - We were entering data in the option Veteran MT Return 
 Edit the comment section - If we entered more than 20 characters - it ran 
 over (wrapped) into the next patients comment section.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
  
  
 Functional Overview:
 ====================
 As originally released, the means test blocking API did not treat 
 domiciliary patients as inpatients.  As a result, when a DOM patient had 
 an outpatient appointment, the blocking API checked the DOM patient's 
 means test status.  There were two issues affecting the blocking action, 
 first, if the patient had a means test required status which was not 
 updated prior to the patients admission to the domiciliary unit, the 
 blocking API used that status to block the outpatient appointment.  
 Secondly, if the patient had a means test older than a year, the API 
 would indicate that the patient needed to update their means test before 
 the appointment could be checked out.  Based on direction from the HEC, 
 for the purposes of the means test blocking, DOM patients will now be 
 treated as inpatients.
  
 The Automated MT Letter Summary report was corrected to handle means test 
 return information that does not include a comment.  This caused several 
 problems as reported in NOIS's PUG-0402-52675 and TAM-0502-30215.  When 
 this report now prints, if there is a comment added through the Veteran 
 MT Return Edit option, only the FIRST 30 characters of the first line 
 print.  This report is not intended to print the entire comment; just 
 part of the first line to show that additional comment information is 
 available for review.
  
 A modification for DCD sites has been included in the letters search 
 functionality.  If a site is a DCD site, when the letters are added to 
 the EAS MT Letter Status File, instead of the 60-day letters being 
 flagged to print first, the 0-day letters will be flagged instead.  This 
 is a change due to the HEC requiring the DCD sites to send ONLY 0-day 
 letters to the veterans.  Intermediate letters are handled by the HEC.
  
 Technical Overview:
 ===================
 This patch will install updated routines for the means test blocking API 
 and corrections to the Automated MT Letters Summary report.  The Letter 
 status generation is also modified to look for DCD sites and flag only 
 zero-day letters for printing (HEC will handle any letters up to the 
 final zero-day notification).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system; however, it should be 
 installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to scheduling 
 users.  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  [Note: TEXT 
 PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text 
 only.]
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the Routine 
 Summary section of this guide are mapped, they should be removed from the 
 mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the 
 Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
 prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*12):
  
     a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a 
        backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It
        will NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b) Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option 
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are 
        in the transport global.
  
     d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
        the components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EAS*1.0*12.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
 respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 2, they should be returned 
 to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - EASMTCHK

 The check for admission to a domiciliary ward has been removed from the 
 inpatient check.  If the patient is admitted, the API will exempt the 
 patient from further checks.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - EASMTL2

 This routine has been modified for DCD sites.  If a site is a DCD site, 
 the 60-day letter is NOT flagged to print, instead, the 0-day letter is 
 flagged to print.  This allows DCD sites to directly print the 0-day 
 letter without having to print the intermediate letters.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - EASMTRPT

 Corrects for the printing of the MT return comment.  The routine does not 
 expect a comment to exist now.  Only the first 30 characters of the first 
 line of the comments is printed as an indicator that a comment exists.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - EASMTL1

 Update letter search message to display 0-day letter tag for DCD sites.
