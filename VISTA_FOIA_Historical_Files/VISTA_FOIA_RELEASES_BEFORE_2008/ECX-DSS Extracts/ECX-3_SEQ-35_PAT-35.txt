Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch addresses reported problems and modifications to the FY 2001
  release of DSS patch ECX*3.0*33.
  
  QUASAR Audit Report
        Routine ECXAECQ has been modified to report by division if applicable.
        This was reported in NOIS UNY-1100-11132.
  
  Purge Extracts
        Routine ECXPURG has been modified to correctly delete 2000 CLI/CLJ
        extracts. (Files #727.816/#727.818)
  
        In certain instances, the current released version failed to
        completely delete the CLJ extract (#727.818). The post-init
        routine, ECX335PT, is a queued job which will clean up any
        partially deleted (purged) CLJ extract records. This was reported
        in NOIS MIN-1200-11194.
  
  Utility routines
        A potential problem was found with utility routine ECXUTL2 and has
        been corrected to allow future use without error.
  
        The MPI value in routine ECXUTL3 was being returned incorrectly.
         
  Treating Speciality Change Extract
        Fixes an undefined error that happens intermittently.
        This was reported in NOIS FTL-0101-51574.
