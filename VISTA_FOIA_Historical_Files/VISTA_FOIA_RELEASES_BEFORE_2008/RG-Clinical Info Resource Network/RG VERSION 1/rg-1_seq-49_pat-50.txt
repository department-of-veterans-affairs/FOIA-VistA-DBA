Associated patches: (v)RG*1*44     <<= must be installed BEFORE `RG*1*50'

Subject: PRIMARY VIEW REJECT EXCEPTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*44 is a required build for patch RG*1*50.
   
  Because of the volume of Primary View Reject exceptions that are
  being generated in the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING]
  option, Identity Management Data Quality (IMDQ) has requested a change
  to the MPI/PD Exception Purge [RG EXCEPTION PURGE] option.
   
  Previously, IMDQ had specified that for every date that a Primary View
  Reject exception occurred for a patient, an exception should remain in
  the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option for review.
   
  The MPI/PD Exception Purge is being changed to treat this exception
  type the same as the other exception types.  If more than one Primary
  View Reject exception occurs for the same patient regardless of the date,
  AND all are active (NOT PROCESSED), the purge will remove the duplicate
  occurrences, leaving only the most recent Primary View Reject entry for
  that patient.
