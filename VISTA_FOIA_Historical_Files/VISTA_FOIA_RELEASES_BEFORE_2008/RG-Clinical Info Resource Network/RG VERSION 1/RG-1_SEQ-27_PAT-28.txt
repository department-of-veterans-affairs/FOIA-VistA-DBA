Subject: DUPLICATE A03 MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*27 is a required build for patch RG*1*28.
   
  Patch RG*1*28 is distributed as an EMERGENCY patch because it will
  reduce the number of messages that are creating a backlog of incoming
  messages occurring on the Master Patient Index (MPI).
   
  Timeframe for installation of EMERGENCY patch RG*1*28:
  ------------------------------------------------------ 
  If your facility currently has DG*5.3*474, MPIF*1.0*24, and RG*1.0*27
  installed, then RG*1*28 should be installed as an EMERGENCY patch
  (e.g., as soon as possible).
   
  If your facility does not yet have DG*5.3*474, MPIF*1.0*24, and
  RG*1.0*27 installed, then RG*1*28 should be installed immediately after
  the installation of DG*5.3*474, MPIF*1.0*24, and RG*1.0*27.
   
  Duplicate ADT-A03 messages are currently being generated for an
  outpatient encounter, clinic-check out, date/time event.  Code has been
  changed in routine RGADT1 to determine if the date and/or event changed
  before updating and broadcasting the message.
   
  A modification was made to routine RGMTHL2.  This Health Level Seven
  (HL7) messaging diagnostic tool has been enhanced to include better
  patient information for the new messaging protocols.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master
  of Records (CMORs), treating facilities, or subscribers.
