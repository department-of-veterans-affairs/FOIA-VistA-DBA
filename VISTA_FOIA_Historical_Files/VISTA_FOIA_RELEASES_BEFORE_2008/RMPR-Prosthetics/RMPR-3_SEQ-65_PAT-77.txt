 Patch RMPR*3.0*77 includes the following NOIS fixes:
  
 1. The Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR PRINT 2319] option for patient
 with multiple items are showing transactions that belong to different
 patient.  Modified routine RMPRPAT7 to only print transactions
 for the same patient.  Reported in NOIS IND-0202-40748.
  
 2. An undefined error occurs during processing of suspense when users 
 link a suspense, create a Prosthetics letter and back to suspense list 
 manager processing.  The link to the Letter Module was removed while 
 in suspense processing list manager screen. This is reported in nois
 MON-0403-50356, SBY-0103-30481, DUR-0103-30328, SFC-1202-61632,
 DUR-1202-30303, SBY-1102-31355, AUG-0902-30993, CAH-0902-30107,
 SBY-0502-33034, ATG-0402-32747, DAY-0402-41893 and COS-1000-42808.
  
 3. When option DSS HCPCS History [RMPR HCPCS HISTORY] is queued to print
 for a station, a different station entries are printed in addition to the
 queued station report.  Routine RMPRSE2 was modified to fix the
 printout and this is reported in nois HEH-1001-40478.
    
 4. Template RMPR VIEW REQUEST has been modified to print the word 
 processing field (Completion Note) in a separate line.  Reported in NOIS 
 TNV-0602-31189.
  
 5. Using option Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR PRINT 2319],
 the patient 2319 records differ depending on which site is selected.  
 Reported in NOIS CPH-0802-42711. 
  
 6. When Prosthetics user add a patient to Prosthetics using option
 Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR PRINT 2319], some of the required
 information for the patient were not entered.  In order to prevent a
 future problem, the ability of adding a Prosthetics patient was removed
 in this option. Reported in NOIS FAV-0302-71019.
  
 7. An error sometime occurs while running the Home Oxygen report New
 Patients [RMPO-RPT-HONEWPT] and option Generate Letters [RMPO 
 LIST/PRINT MANAGER] when a dangling 'AC' cross-reference of primary 
 item field for a deleted item still exist.  Modified routines RMPOLZA,
 RMPOPED and RMPORNQ in order to prevent the error and use Fileman during
 the deletion of an Oxygen item.  Reported in nois AMA-0503-71417 and
 CHY-0503-51280.
  
 8. When user runs the Billing Transactions [RMPO BILLING TRANSACTIONS] 
 option, a future billing month is allowed to be created.  This causes
 a problem for some Home Oxygen patients that were entered after the
 creation date.  Routine RMPOBILU was modified to prevent the creation
 of future Home Oxygen billing month.  This is reported in nois
 SLC-0103-52515.
  
 9. Not all unlinked 2319 records are printed in the Print Patient Records 
 Not Linked To Suspense [RMPR RECORDS WITHOUT SUSPENSE] report.  Modified 
 routine RMPRSP7 to print all unlinked 2319 records.  This is reported in 
 nois UNY-0303-10990.
  
 10. Undefined error for variable WHO while running option Print NPPD
 Worksheets [RMPR NPPD PRT].  Modified routine RMPRN73.  This is reported 
 in nois CTX-0403-70080.
  
 11. Allows printing of Prosthetics reports to P-MESSAGE device and 
 queuing. Modified routines RMPR5N1, RMPR5N2, RMPR5N3, RMPROPN, RMPROPN1,
 RMPRP55, RMPRSE1, RMPRSE2, RMPRSEA, RMPRSP, RMPRSP1, RMPRPSP2 and
 RMPRSP3.  The following options are affected:
  a. Print Current HCPCS Balance by HCPCS [RMPR INV STOCK BY HCPCS];
  b. Print Current Item Balance by Location [RMPR INV STOCK BY LOCATION];
  c. Print VA Form 10-1210 [RMPR INV PRINT/CHECK BAL];
  d. Print Closed Suspense Records [RMPR SUSPENSE PRINT CLOSED];
  e. Print Detailed Open/Pending Suspense Records [RMPR SUSPENSE PRINT];
  f. Print 5 Day Old Suspense Report [RMPR SUSPENSE PRINT 5 DAY OLD];
  h. Print Summary Open/Pending Suspense Records [RMPR PENDING SUSPENSE];
  i. Print Suspense Statistics [RMPR SUSPENSE STAT];
  j. List Open 1358 Prosthetic Transactions [RMPR PRINT OPEN TRANS];
  k. List Open 1358 Transactions By Initiator [RMPR PRINT OPEN TRANS INIT];
  l. List Open Stock Issues [RMPR PRINT OPEN STK ISS];

  p. Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR PRINT 2319]
 Reported in nois PUG-0801-51599 and TAM-1101-31264.
  
 12. Prosthetics patient encounters should only have one entry
 per patient in a single day.  Since the background job that processes
 Prosthetics encounter to PCE goes back to 90 days, other patient 
 transactions are being process to PCE the next time the background job 
 runs. Routine RMPRPCEB was modified to prevent multiple transactions to be
 processed to PCE.  Reported in nois PRE-0902-60462.
  
 13. Undefined error occurs when running option Print NPPD Worksheets 
 [RMPR NPPD PRT] where the TMP global is not being defined.  Also, 
 execute the proper kill of variables after closing the device. Modified
 routine RMPRN6 and this is reported in nois TAM-0303-30926 and 
 MAC-0201-61936.
  
 14. Undefined error occurs while running options Close Out [RMPR
 CLOSE-OUT] or Complete Form 2529-3 [RMPR COMPLETE 2529-3].  Routine
 RMPR29D was modified.  This is reported in nois PUG-0202-52047 and
