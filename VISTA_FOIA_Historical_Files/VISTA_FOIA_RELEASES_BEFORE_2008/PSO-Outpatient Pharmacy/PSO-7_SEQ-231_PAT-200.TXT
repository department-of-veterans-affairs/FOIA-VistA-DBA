Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

  This patch contains the FY 2007 Quarter 2 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0
 enhancements. 
  
  
 ***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
 Please ensure that your vendor is aware of the changes being made by this 
 patch. There are changes (described below) that affect both the HEALTH 
 LEVEL SEVEN (HL7) messages (content of fields only - no new fields are
 added) and the laser label stream.
  
 If you are using automated dispensing equipment that relies on 
 the data stream sent to the laser labels port, you have 2 options:
   1. Implement the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI) (available with
      released patch PSO*7*156) or 
   2. Contact your vendor to make adjustments based on the new data stream.
  
  
 Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) enhancements: 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Modified to use the new commercial warning label source to send the
 warning label text to the automated filling equipment. The OPAI WARNING
 LABEL SOURCE field (#16.2) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) must be set
 to "N" for "New" to send the warning labels from the new commercial data
 source to OPAI. It can be set by using the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
 [PSS SYS EDIT] option.
  Example:
  
 Select OPTION NAME: PSS SYS EDIT       Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
 Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
  
 PMIS PRINTER: L8150$PRT// 
 PMIS LANGUAGE: English// 
 WARNING LABEL SOURCE: NEW// 
 CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE: NEW//
 OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE: ?
      Enter "N" for NEW to use commercial data source for OPAI warning 
 labels.
      Choose from: 
        N        NEW
 OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE: N  NEW
  
    a. The warning text is sent as one record per warning.
    b. The text is sent in English or Spanish depending on the patient's
       other language settings. 
    c. If the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) begins
       with numbers 1,2,3,4, or 5, the NO TRANSFER warning text from the RX
       CONSULT file (#54) entry number 20 is automatically sent as one of
       the first 5 warnings when the OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE is set to 
       "New".
  
  
 2. If the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (BAI) field (#.121) of the PATIENT file
 (#2) is set, the text "VAB" concatenated with the BAI code is sent in the
 Address field of the PID segment of the HL7 message to the filling
 equipment.
  
 Here are some examples of this field:
  
 When the permanent address is active:
 PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~P~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N||""|||||||||||||||
 |||
  
 When the temporary address is active:
 PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~P~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N^TADD-1~TADD-2 
 TADD-3~PLANO~TX~12345~~C~~""~~~
  
 When the address is flagged as BAI:
 PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~VAB1~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N||""||||||||||||
 ||||||
  
 "VAB1" - indicates Bad Address Indicator and 1 is for UNDELIVERABLE (2 for
 HOMELESS, 3 for OTHER)
  
  
 Laser Label enhancements:
 -------------------------
 1. Print the last 4 digits of the Social Security Number (SSN) instead of
 the last 6 digits.
  
 2. Change the name on the mailing label back to Last name,First name
 format.
  
 3. On the Pharmacy Fill Card portion of the label, replace the text 
 "Mfr ___________________" with:
    a. NDC/MFR_______________ for non-ePharmacy sites
    b. NDC nnnnn-nnnn-nn for ePharmacy sites 
  
 4. Signature log enhancements:
    a. Print current date at top
    b. Do not print user name (if more than 1 prescription was included to
       be signed, the user name could be different for each one).
    c. Correct the spacing and continuation paging issues if one or more 
       of the prescriptions has been discontinued before printing the 
       signature log.
    d. Add a barcode to enable scanning to remove the patient's name from 
       the Bingo Board.
    e. Add as much of the drug name as will fit on the label.
    f. Add hidden action "RS" for Reprint Signature log to the prescription
       profile screen.
    g. While printing original labels (not reprint of the signature log), 
       if all of the fills have a routing of mail, the signature log will
       not be printed.
    h. The line "Relationship_________________ Counseled? _____" is changed
       to "Relation_____ Counseling Refused__ Accepted__".
  
  
 5. When a fill is released, if the BAI is no longer set or there is an 
 active temporary address, the "B" is removed from the status column of 
 the patient profile. (This is removed by making an additional entry in 
 the label log. The "B" comes from the "last" entry having a bad address 
 condition at the time the label printed).
  
  
  
 To address E3R 19820 and Remedy ticket 68810, the following code changes
 are included in this patch:
  
 1. Add the capability to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy
 label printer(s) to control where the ScripTalk labels print for
 multi-divisional sites. The new SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING multiple
 (#47) in PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) has been created to store this
 information in Pharmacy Data Management patch PSS*1*122. The multiple
 contains LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED field (#.01) and SCRIPTALK DEVICE
 field (#.02).
  
 The added functionality works in conjunction with the existing ScripTalk 
 divisional functionality, so a divisional ScripTalk device must be
 defined.  If no mapping is defined in the new fields, ScripTalk labels
 will continue to print on the printer defined for the division.  If
 a pharmacy printer is mapped to a ScripTalk printer, the ScripTalk label
 will automatically be printed on the mapped ScripTalk printer.
  
  
 2. Modify the ScripTalk Device Definition Enter/Edit [PSO SCRIPTALK
 DEVICE DEF'N] option to allow definition of printer mapping for 
 ScripTalk devices.  The user will be prompted to define the ScripTalk 
 printer by division or by printer mapping.  After selecting D for 
 division, the divisional definition has not changed.  After selecting 
 P for printer mapping, the user will be prompted "LABEL PRINTER TO BE
 MAPPED". The device entered into this field corresponds to the label
 printer selected during Pharmacy login and/or the printer selected during
 print from suspense functions. Next, "SCRIPTALK DEVICE" will be prompted,
 and this field should contain the ScripTalk printer to be mapped to the
 regular label printer.
  
  
 MISCELLANEOUS ENHANCEMENTS:
 ---------------------------
 1. A new field FINISH DATE/TIME field (#38.3) is added to the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
 2. When using the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option, if the
 routing is not WINDOW and the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field of the
 PATIENT file (#2) is set (value of 1=UNDELIVERABLE, 2=HOMELESS, 3=OTHER)
 and the patient does not have an active temporary address, the
 prescription fill will not be sent to automated filling equipment and/or
 to the label printer. Also, if the fill's routing is mail and the 
 patient's MAIL field (#.03) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is set to
 "DO NOT MAIL" and the current date is before the MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION
 DATE field (#.05) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), the label will not
 print and the fill will not be sent to the automated filling equipment.
  
 The first time a prescription is not sent/label printed, a MailMan message
 will be generated to the user who queued the print from suspense and the
 members of the PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group. An entry will also
 be set in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) activity log.
  
 Example activity log entry:
 ---------------------------
 Activity Log:
 #   Date        Reason         Rx Ref           Initiator Of Activity
 =====================================================================
 1   02/19/07    SUSPENSE       ORIGINAL         OPPHARMACIST,ONE
 Comments: RX not printed from suspense due to BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR
  
 - or -
 Comments: RX not printed from suspense due to DO NOT MAIL
  
 Example MailMan message:
 ------------------------

 lines
 From: OUTPATIENT PHARMACY PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following prescriptions with a routing of mail were not printed/sent 
 to external interface due to the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR being set and
 no active temporary address or patient has an active MAIL status of DO NOT
 MAIL:
  
 OPPATIENT,ONE   000001234   (BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR)
   100002608  (1)  A AND Z OINTMENT
   100002609  (0)  ASPIRIN 325MG TABS
  
 OPPATIENT,FOUR   000004321   (DO NOT MAIL)
   100002654A  (0)  BACITRACIN OINTMENT 1OZ
  
  
 3. Modify the report from the Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI 
 SUSPENDED] option to allow printing by more than one division and also 
 include prescriptions suspended for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy 
 (CMOP). This report was also changed to not prompt for a start date.
  
 Example:
 --------
 Select OPTION NAME: PSO BAI SUSPENDED     Bad Address Suspended List
 Bad Address Suspended List
  
 This option shows unprinted suspended prescriptions for patients who have
 the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR set in the PATIENT file and no active temporary 
 address.
