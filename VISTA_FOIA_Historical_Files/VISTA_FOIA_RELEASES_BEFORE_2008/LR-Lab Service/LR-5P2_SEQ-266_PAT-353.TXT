 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 The changes to the LABORATORY SITE FILE (#69.9) data dictionary in this
 patch are required to support the Data Standardization of Orders
 project. This requires that fields DEFAULT NATURE OF ORDER (#150.1) and
 DEFAULT DC REASON (#150.2) be screened. This patch will add a screen
 call to $$SCREEN^XTID and an explanation.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000130687    LABORATORY SITE FILE (69.9) DD modifications to
    support Data Standardization of Orders
  
     Problem:
     --------
     During the requirements analysis and coding for the Data
     Standardization of Orders three packages were identified that CPRS
     uses to place orders that do not use expected APIs. The Lab
     package was identified as one of those packages.
  
     The changes needed are very minor and specific directions have
     been provided to make them. For the Lab package changes need to be
     made to the LABORATORY SITE FILE (69.9). This change requires that
     fields DEFAULT NATURE OF ORDER (150.1) and DEFAULT DC REASON
     (150.2) have look-up screen added to them.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A new Kernel Toolkit API $$SCREEN^XTID (DBIA 4631) is added to the
     SCREEN definition of fields DEFAULT NATURE OF ORDER (150.1) and
     DEFAULT DC REASON (150.2) of the LABORATORY SITE FILE (69.9).
