Description:
============

 ****************************** ATTENTION *******************************
 An issue was introduced with patch PSO*7*260 that removed the display
 of Dosage, Verb, Dispense Unit, Noun, Route, and Schedule from the
 VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option.  This functionality is restored in
 PSO*7*264 Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch. 
  
 It is suggested that the Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch PSO*7*264 be 
 installed immediately after the ePharmacy/ECME Enhancements bundle of 
 patches in order to restore full functionality of the option.
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  Below is a list of all the applications
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*260
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*363
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*5
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*127
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*63
  
 The first three patches (BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260) will be
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  Patches PSX*2*63 and
 PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an
 implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution and the
 stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed prior to
 the installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
         
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).
 After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the
 site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy
 product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not
 to activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the Integrated Billing application as described below: 
                                                           
 1. The software supporting the Patient Insurance Info View/Edit option [IBCN
 PATIENT INSURANCE] was enhanced to include the display of ePharmacy specific
 data associated with the Insurance Plan.  The PLAN ID, PLAN NAME, PLAN STATUS 
 (local and national) are to be displayed so that the billing user is able
 to verify that an insurance plan has been linked with an ePharmacy payer and 
 if the payer is turned on for transmission.
  
 2. Claims/bills that have been electronically submitted to the payer are 
 getting the 2nd and 3rd notices printed.  These notices are only necessary 
 for paper claims.  The software supporting the Accounts Receivable Nightly 
 Process Background Job option [PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS] shall be modified to
 prevent 2nd and 3rd notices from being printed when the bill has been
 submitted electronically.
  
 3. The software supporting the ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME
 BILLING EVENTS] has been modified so that the report will print by
 electronic pharmacy division.  These types of divisions are outpatient
 pharmacy dispensing areas which are defined with a National Council for
 Prescription Drug (NCPDP) number and able to submit pharmacy claims to a
 payer electronically.  The user will be able to select one, multiple or
 all ePharmacy divisions.  The E-PHARMACY DIVISION field (#.09) was added
 to the EVENT sub-file (#366.141) of the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14)
 to support the changes.
  
 4. The software has been modified to prevent 1st party copays from being
 put on hold automatically (by the system) for non-electronically billable 
 Over-the-Counter (OTC) drugs; and any electronically billable prescription 
 for which the third party is paying a zero dollar amount.
  
 5. The software supporting the Enter/Edit Billing Information option
 [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] was modified to retrieve the National Drug Code
 (NDC) number from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) instead of the DRUG file
 (#50) when adding/editing a claim.  The software supporting the Copy and
 Cancel option [IB COPY AND CANCEL] was modified to retrieve the NDC# from
 the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) instead of the IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION
 REFILL file (#362.4) when copying data from the old entry to the new entry.
  
 6. The business user has requested that a mail group be created that
 represents ePharmacy-related notifications so that the user can review these
 messages in a more efficient manner. This patch will transport the new mail
 group IBCNR EPHARM and mail notifications that pertain to ePharmacy shall be
 forwarded to the IBCNR EPHARM mail group.
   
 7. The IB software supporting CLAIM INFORMATION screen of the Third Party
 Joint Inquiry option [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] was modified to be
 able to detect what kind of identifier (NCPDP number or National Provider
 ID number) was used in the claim and display the appropriate label when
 generating the screen.

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 There is a bug in the KIDs installation process for multi-builds.  Even
 though you may have requested that the menu rebuild occur for patches
 BPS*1*5 and PSO*7*260 while answering the installation questions, it is 
 possible that the menu rebuild did not occur.  If the rebuild did not
 occur and your system does not do an automatic menu rebuild in a nightly
 TaskMan process, you should do a manual rebuild via the Build Primary Menu
 Trees option [XQBUILDTREE] found in the Menu Rebuild Menu [XQBUILDMAIN]
 option.
  
 The BPS post-install routine delivered with BPS*1*5 will do the tasks
 tasks listed below.  This post-install will be tasked and may take several
 hours to run.  When it is complete, it will send an email to the installer
 and the users in the BPS OPECC mail group.  The post-install routines
 BPS01P5* are being left on the system after the install.  They will be
 deleted with a future patch.
    1.  Delete the files listed in the 'The following is a list of files
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    2.  Delete the fields listed in the 'The following is a list of fields
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    3.  Delete obsolete records from the BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91)
        file.  These records are for National Council for Prescription Drug
        Programs (NCPDP) version 3x, which make these records obsolete.
    4.  Populate the new BPS STATISTICS file (#9002313.58) categories
        (Accepted Reversals, Rejected Reversals, and Dropped to Paper).
    5.  Populate the new SUBMIT DATE/TIME (#6) field of the BPS
        TRANSACTIONS file (#9002313.59).
    6.  Convert the ECME log data from global ^BPSECP("LOG") to the new
        BPS LOG file (#9002313.12).
    7.  Convert the submit processing queue from global ^BPSECP("BPSOSRX")
        to the temporary global ^XTMP("BPS-PROC").
  
 The IB post-install routine delivered with IB*2*363 will populate the
 E-PHARMACY DIVISION field (#.09) of the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14).
 This is a new field delivered with this patch.  The time required to
 accomplish this task may vary from site to site and is dependent upon how
 many electronic pharmacy claims are processed daily at the site.  The post
 install routine IB20P363 is being left on the system after the install.
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
  
 The PSO post-install routine delivered with PSO*7*260 will set the
 REJECT INFO sub-file (#52.25) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) as READ
 ONLY.  This will prevent users from entering rejects through FileMan,
 which causes problems to the Outpatient Pharmacy application.  The post
 install routine PSO260PI is being left on the system after the install.
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
