Subject: MODIFY HANDLING OF IV DURATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. A site reported a problem with the new duration field that was added to
 CPRS GUI v25. In response to a patient safety issue, this field was added 
 to the IV Fluid order dialog. In addition, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 
 was modified to always have the duration field be used for the stop date 
 calculation. This has caused problems in sites where they have policies 
 that say certain medications can only be written for a certain period of 
 time. This patch corrects this problem by modifying Inpatient Medications 
 V. 5.0 to consider the duration the same way as all other stop date 
 parameters, rather than as an override.
  
 In order to assist in communications with the provider, an alert will be 
 sent to the ordering provider whenever the duration they entered is not 
 used to calculate the stop date of the order. HD0000000109618,
 HD0000000111592.
  
 2. Several sites reported an error occurring when entering an IV order 
 that contained an allergy order-check. This patch corrects this problem.
