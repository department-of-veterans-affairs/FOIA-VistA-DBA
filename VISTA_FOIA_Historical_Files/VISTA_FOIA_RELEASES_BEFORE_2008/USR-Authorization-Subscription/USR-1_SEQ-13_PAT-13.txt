Subject: CORRECT EFFECTIVE DATE & EXPIRATION DATE

Category:

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 Since the implementation of Patch USR*1.0*12 the field, EXPIRATION DATE 
 (.04), in file USER CLASS MEMBERSHIP(8930.3) has been incorrect.  When 
 ever a user is terminated the date and time has been placed in the .04 field 
 causing the input transform verification to fail.  The .04 field is now set to 
 contain only the date and not the time.
  
 This patch will correct the user termination routine and also remove the 
 time of termination from the .04 field.
 
 Prior to this patch a person could make an entry in the file USER CLASS 
 MEMBERSHIP (8930.3) field, EFFECTIVE DATE (.03), with a date that follows 
 the entry in the field, EXPIRATION DATE(.04).  This patch will correct 
 this problem.
