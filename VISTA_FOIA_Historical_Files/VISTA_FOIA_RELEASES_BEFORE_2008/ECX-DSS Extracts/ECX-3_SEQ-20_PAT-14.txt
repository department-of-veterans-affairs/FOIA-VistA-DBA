Description: 
============

 [B  ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
    Patch ECX*3*14 addresses a number of issues discovered after release
    of the FY1999 Update patch (ECX*3*8).
    
    (1) Sites have reported missing workload data in the Nursing (NUR) 
        Extract, if Nursing staff did not use the Classify Patients 
        by Ward option on a daily basis.  At some facilities, staff 
   [B     used the AMIS 1106 Acuity Edit option for ward classifications  
        at times when they were short-staffed (e.g., on holidays or
        or weekends).  
   
        The NUR extract process will now compensate for a missing daily
        patient acuity classification.  If a patient has not been 
        classified for a particular day, a classification record will
        be created in the NURSING EXTRACT file (#727.805) for that day.
        The ACUITY LEVEL field (#9) will be set to the patient's last
        known acuity level, while the NURSE LOCATION field (#12) and
        the NURSING BEDSECTION field (#13) will reflect the patient's
        location as of midnight on that day.
   
        This compensation process requires that a patient be classified
        at least once by Nursing staff (i.e., using the Classify
        Patients by Ward option) during the monthly extract period.  No
        extract record(s) will be created for a patient for any day
        before that initial Nursing classification date in a given month.
    
        (See E3R 11583.)
    
    (2) In the Clinic Visit (CLI) Extract, the length of appointment for
        all stop code additions in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68)
        was 29 minutes.  This appointment length data is a part of the
        FEEDER KEY field (#9) in the CLINIC EXTRACT file (#727.803) 
        record.
   
        This patch will now allow stop code additions, which are the 
        result of data transfer from the TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES (TIU),
        to have a Feeder Key that more accurately reflects appointment
        length.  Instead of using 29 minutes, the actual default length
        of appointment for the clinic associated with the stop code
        addition will be used.
    
        Also, setup of extract records for ancillary EKG visits was not
        properly performed, causing overwrite of the patient NAME field
        (#6).  This resulted in record rejects in Austin.  This patch 
        corrects that problem, and also lowers the maximum number of 
        records per transmission message to 150.
   
        (See NOIS BRK-1198-11372, BAC-0199-42123, IND-0199-42474.)
    
    (3) The Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit [ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT]
        option is being placed out-of-order until work can be 
        completed on a revised report.
   
    (4) A cross reference clean-up is performed in the post-installation.
        The obsolete "AINV" index is removed from each DSS extract file, 
        and each extract file description is updated.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*14):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*14.
    
   6.  If you do not intend to queue the installation to run after normal
       business hours, then answer "NO" to the following prompt:
   
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
   
       If you answer "YES", then the installation will require much more 
       than 2 minutes to run due to the menu rebuild process. 
   
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       ECXMENU              Package Extracts ... 
       ECX SOURCE AUDITS    Extract Audit Reports Menu ... 
  
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
   9.  Once the patch has been successfully installed, routine ECX314PT
       should be deleted from your system.
