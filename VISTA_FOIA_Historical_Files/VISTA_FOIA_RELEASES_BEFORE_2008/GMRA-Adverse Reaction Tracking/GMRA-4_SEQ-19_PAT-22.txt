Associated patches: (v)GMRA*4*18   <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRA*4*22'

Subject: HDRApplication Installation

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This is the second patch in support of the VistA Data Extraction Framework
 (VDEF) effort, allowing changes to the PATIENT ALLERGIES (#120.8), ADVERSE
 REACTION REPORTING (#120.85) and ADVERSE REACTION ASSESSMENT (#120.86)
 files to be transmitted to the HDR (Health Data Repository).
  
 The first patch, GMRA*4.0*18, installed the necessary "triggers" to 
 identify when data should be sent to the HDR.  This patch adds the 
 infrastructure needed to create and send the HL7 messages to the HDR.
  
 ** IMPORTANT **
  
 Sites should not install this software prior to your assigned HDR 
 installation date. You will be contacted approximately two weeks prior to 
 your HDR installation date and provided with instructions on when and in 
 what order to install these patches and the VDEF software. Additionally, 
 sites should not configure or attempt to utilize the VDEF software 
 associated with these patches prior to your assigned HDR installation 
 date, at which time Technical Support Office personnel will work with you 
 to activate that application and start your data transmissions to the HDR 
 database. (If you do not know your HDR installation date, you can find 
 that information by going to 
 http://vaww.teamshare.va.gov/hdr_implementation/ and selecting 
 Implementation Schedule from the Quick Launch panel on the left side of 
 the page.)
