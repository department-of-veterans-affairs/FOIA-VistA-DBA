Subject: VistAWeb/CCOW and Miscellaneous VistAWeb Changes

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 At random intervals the patient displayed in VistAWeb is not the expected
 patient. This has occurred when launching VistAWeb from the CPRS tools
 menu where the user's CPRS session is not participating in a patient
 synchronization process known as the Clinical Context Object Workgroup
 (CCOW).   Due to heightened patient safety concerns a change is being made
 to VistAWeb.
  
 The changes to VistAWeb will be performed centrally. No modifications need
 to be performed by field staff, other than communicating to users that
 these modifications have occurred. When a user attempts to launch VistAWeb
 from the CPRS that is not participating in patient synchronization, they
 will see a Patient Mismatch - Web Page Dialog box that has the title
 WARNING - VISTAWEB CANNOT RUN, and then VistAWeb will exit.
  
 In addition to the patient synchronization issue described in the WARNING
 - VISTAWEB CANNOT RUN message, the following corrections have been
 incorporated into this release:
  
 1.  The control panels (menus) were corrected to keep them from
 jumping back to the top when the user collapses a menu selection.
  
 2.  The script timeout period was extended to prevent page loading 
 errors on patients who have a large number of remote sites.
  
 3.  Invalid_Page_Disconnect error messages were removed.
  
 4.  SQL Server INSERT INTO errors are now captured when a patient 
 object hasn't been properly defined.
  
 5.  An error in MDO for Meds was corrected.
  
 6.  An error in MDO for Progress Notes was corrected.
  
 7.  Two pages that were not pointing to the proper timeout page URL 
 were corrected.
  
 8.  Martinez, CA was changed to Northern California HCS.
  
 9.  A new stats page was added to the application.
  
 10. Patient Name and SSN now appear on printed reports.
  
 Coordinating the behavior of different programs running simultaneously on 
 the same PC is not a simple task. The CCOW standard is supposed to assist 
 that effort, and VHA has attempted to follow that standard to help avoid 
 user confusion. However, given the ways users employ CPRS (having 
 multiple CPRS sessions open with different patients displayed in each, 
 etc.), we have found it difficult to account for every situation to allow 
 the standard work as expected. We will continue to explore options to 
 improve how integrated clinical programs interact with one another. The 
 changes we are introducing with this VistAWeb update should make program
 behavior safer. We appreciate your understanding and assistance in
 improving our clinical systems.
