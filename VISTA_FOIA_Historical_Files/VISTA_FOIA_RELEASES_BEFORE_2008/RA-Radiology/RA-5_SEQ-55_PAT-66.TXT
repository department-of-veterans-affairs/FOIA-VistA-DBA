Subject: ACCEPT DX CODE CHANGES FROM TALK AND TRIGGER ALERTS FOR SEC DX CODES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve two issues.
      
 First, when utilizing Talk Technology (such as Talk Station or 
 Power Scribe), current functionality will allow the user to update 
 a diagnosis code but VistA Radiology does not recognize the 
 update.  This gives the user the impression that an update has been 
 accepted and if an abnormal diagnosis code was entered, an 
 abnormal alert would be triggered, but in actuality the alert was not 
 triggered for the abnormal diagnosis code prior to this patch.
      
 Second, Talk Technology does not trigger an abnormal alert if
 a secondary diagnosis code is Abnormal.
      
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS
 =========================
 HD0000000108405 - ALERT NOT CREATED
 HD0000000114302 - Alerts not received on Abnormal Secondary Diagnosis      
    
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 Problem #1
 -------
 When utilizing Talk Technology (Talk Station/Power Scribe), the users
 will attempt to update a diagnosis code on a completed report via
 an addendum.  VistA Radiology does not currently recognize diagnosis
 code updates only addendum text additions.
      
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to the VistA Radiology routines named in this 
 patch to accept both Primary and Secondary diagnosis code updates entered
 via Talk Technology addendum.
      
 Problem #2
 ----------
 Talk Technology does not trigger an abnormal alert for an abnormal 
 secondary diagnosis code.
      
 Resolution #2
 ----------
 A modification will be made to trigger an abnormal alert when an abnormal
 secondary diagnosis code is entered and passed to VistA.
        
 *****Note*****
 Once a report contains an abnormal diagnosis code, an abnormal 
 alert will be generated for each subsequent addendum as long as an 
 abnormal diagnosis code remains with the report.
