Subject: Broken Subclass Pointers

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 When editing user class definitions, via the USER CLASS DEFINITION option, 
 some classes contain subclasses that are nonexistent. The user sees a 
 number instead of class name. This is caused by "broken SUBCLASS" pointers.
 This patch deletes the "broken SUBCLASS" pointers from file 8930, USR CLASS
 FILE. After this patch is installed the user will no longer see subclasses 
 that do not have a name.
