Subject: FIXES FOR HOW MRA SOFTWARE HANDLES NON-MEDICARE INSURANCES

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch prevents a claim from being a Medical Remittance 
 Advice (MRA) request claim when Medicare (WNR) is the secondary 
 insurance, and prevents the deletion of MRA secondary insurance.
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ==================
 1. HD119948   Prevent a claim from being an MRA request claim when 
                         Medicare (WNR) is the secondary insurance
  
 2. HD098602   Prevent MRA secondary insurance deletion

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD119948   Prevent a claim from being an MRA request claim when 
                         Medicare (WNR) is the secondary insurance
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  When the payer sequence is on the secondary insurance and that insurance 
  is Medicare (WNR) this is currently identified as a valid MRA request 
  claim, but both VistA and Emdeon are unable to handle this rare case.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  This patch modifies routines to first check for this scenario and when
  identified prevent an MRA request claim from being submitted.  It then 
  moves the bill payers sequence to the tertiary insurance, prevents it
  from being electronically transmitted, allowing the user to authorize the
  bill and print locally.
  
 2. HD098602   Prevent MRA secondary insurance deletion
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  When a claim is in a Request MRA status when Medicare (WNR) is the 
  current insurance company, the users are allowed to delete the secondary
  insurance from the list of the patient's insurances. When the MRA arrives
  into VistA, the claim is turned into a secondary claim and the claim 
  becomes authorized, but it cannot be successfully sent to Accounts 
  Receivable because the insurance information is gone.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Enhance the set logic for the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file "AE" new style 
  cross reference, which prevents the deletion of insurance policy entries
  from the PATIENT (#2) file if a bill has been created for that insurance
  company, to include the subsequent insurance after Medicare when Medicare
  is the current insurance.
