Description: 
============

   The modifications included in this patch have been made to correct
   earlier modifications made in patch ES*1*21.
    
   (1) Printing a uniform offense report to a slave print device could
       not be accomplished after ES*1*21.  This has been corrected.
       (NOIS DUB-0698-30622)
   
   (2) To address the issue raised in NOIS MEM-0697-71350, patch ES*1*21
       modified the set of codes in the data dictionary definition of 
       the CATEGORY field (#.04) of the ESP MASTER NAME INDEX file (#910).
       That modification is being removed in this patch.  (The code 'O'
       will stand for 'Outsider'.)  To address MEM-0697-71350, the code
       in line CAT^ESPMNI0 is being modified.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the

       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*25.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
