Subject: PHARMACIST WAS ABLE TO ORDER NARCOTIC AND SCRIPTALK LABELS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will modify the process to require a physician to have a Drug 
 Enforcement Agency (DEA) number or Veteran's Affairs (VA) number before 
 they can order controlled substances.
 It will also modify ScriptTalk labels to print 'SIGNATURE IS TOO LONG' 
 verbiage if the instructions are more than three lines.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 TNV-0205-31277          pharmacist was able to order narcotic
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A controlled substance can be ordered using Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option even though the provider does
 not have a DEA# or VA#.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify this option so if the drug being ordered is a controlled substance, the 
 provider is required to have a DEA# or VA#.
  
  
 HD0000000091691         Script Talk label issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The code restricts each line to 46 characters.  This may create a signature
 that overflows to more than 3 lines yet only 3 lines print on the label. 
 Currently, if the signature is longer than 196 total characters, it is
 replaced with the following statement (English) ' SIG IS TOO LONG. REPRINT A
 NON-VOIDED VISTA LABEL AND PLACE OVER THIS SCRIPTALK LABEL' or (Spanish) '
 INDICACIONES MUY LARGAS. IMPRIMA UNA ETIQUETA DE VISTA VALIDA Y APLIQUELA
 SOBRE ESTA ETIQUETA DE SCRIPTALK EN LA BOTELLA.'  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code needs to be modified so if the signature is more than 3 lines (total
 of 138 characters), the previous statement is printed on the label.
