Description: 
============

 This patch provides Incomplete Records Tracking with the interface
 capabilities to the Core Financial Logistics System (CoreFLS).  CoreFLS
 will replace the Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity,
 and Procurement (IFCAP) package.
  
 Vendor information for CoreFLS will be held nationally on a remote
 database.  To alleviate traffic over your network, a local vendor file,
 LOCAL VENDOR (#392.31) has been placed on your local system to be used to
 store and access your frequently use vendors.  The LOCAL VENDOR file 
 (#392.31) is associated with the Beneficiary Travel namespace and has been
 distributed in the DGBT*1*2 Beneficiary Travel patch.
  
 A new menu is added to your Incomplete Records Tracking Menu.  This menu
 called, Add a local vendor (COREFLS), will allow users holding the DGJ
 LOCAL VENDOR key the ability to add CoreFLS vendors to the LOCAL VENDOR
 file (#392.31). This menu will verify the existence of the CoreFLS 
 package before allowing the user to proceed with the CoreFLS vendor query.
  
 A Variable Pointer is added to the TRANSCRIBED BY field (#10.04) allowing 
 a user to choose a CoreFLS vendor from the LOCAL VENDOR fie (#392.31).  
 Users will not be allowed to add vendors (LAYGO) at this field into the 
 LOCAL VENDOR file, similar to accessing a vendor from the VENDOR file
 (#440).  Users can only add CoreFLS vendors through the above mentioned
 'Add a local vendor (COREFLS)' holding the DGJ LOCAL VENDOR key.
  
 This patch may be installed at anytime.  However, the determination to go 
 active with CoreFLS will need to be coordinated with HIMS.
