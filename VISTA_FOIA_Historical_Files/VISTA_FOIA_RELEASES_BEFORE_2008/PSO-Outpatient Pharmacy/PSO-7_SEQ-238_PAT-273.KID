This patch enhances the functionality of PSO59.
"BLD",6337,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",6337,1,3,0)
PSO59 retrieves data from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and has three 
"BLD",6337,1,4,0)
parameters: PSOIEN (optional), PSOTXT (optional), and LIST (required).  
"BLD",6337,1,5,0)
While PSOIEN and PSOTXT are both labeled as optional, PSO59 requires that 
"BLD",6337,1,6,0)
either parameter be passed in or no data will be returned.  PSOIEN is the 
"BLD",6337,1,7,0)
internal entry number (IEN) of a site, PSOTXT is a free text entry that 
"BLD",6337,1,8,0)
works as a search parameter, and LIST is the subscript name used in the 
"BLD",6337,1,9,0)
^TMP global.  This routine will now return field values for the NPI 
"BLD",6337,1,10,0)
INSTITUTION field (#101) and NCPDP NUMBER field (#1008) from the 
"BLD",6337,1,11,0)
OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
