Description:
============

 ** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  executable file. Installation of this GUI is NOT required immediately 
  after the KIDS install for the Patch to function. ***
 
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
  
 1. The user is allowed to view and print the Bar Code Medication 
    Administration (BCMA) ward specific reports via the BCMA GUI (Graphical 
    user interface) application without having to open a patient record.
  
  
 2. When administering a Pro Re Nata (PRN) medication or documenting a PRN 
    Effectiveness, the Medication Log dialog box or the PRN Effectiveness 
    Log respectively will display a vitals table with the vital signs: 
    Temperature (Temp), 
   
    Pulse, Respiration (Resp), Blood Pressure (BP) and Pain. Each of the vital 
    signs will list up to four (4) vital entries made within the last 
    seven (7) days.
  
  
 3. When the user opens a patient record from the BCMA GUI application, the 
    Vitals Cumulative Report can be accessed from the Reports menu.
  
  
 4. When enabled, BCMA will broadcast BCMA Medication Log data to applications 
    that subscribe to BCMA Heath Level 7 (HL7) Messaging.  The events or
    transactions that trigger the message broadcasts are MEDPASS, UPDATE
    STATUS, ADD COMMENT, and PRN EFFECTIVENESS.  Upon the completion of each
    "trigger event," BCMA will send HL7 version 2.4 compliant messages to
    Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications and other subscribing 
    products or applications. The BCMA HL7 interface must be activated 
    after installation for messaging to occur.
    
  
 5. When the user launches the BCMA GUI application, the message box 
    displays information regarding BCMA 508 compliance. This information 
    can also be found in the BCMA Help, About dialog box.
  
  
 6. When the user scans a currently infusing or stopped bag on the VDL IV 
    tab and the associated order has had any changes made to it since the 
    infusing or stopped bag's label was printed, the Scan IV box will display 
    Order changes including bag status and changes made on the associated 
    order.
  
  
 7. A new column "Bag Information" has been added to the VDL IV tab. This 
    column contains the administration status, date and time of the currently 
    infusing or stopped bag on its associated order and one of the following 
    messages if the order has changed since the bag label was printed. 
    "INFUSING bag on changed order" or "STOPPED bag on changed order". 
    This column is updated every time the patient record is opened or the 
    VDL is refreshed. 
    
  
 8. Problem: NOIS MIN-0703-42067
    The BCMA GUI does not print the Medication History Report for large 
    volume IV's on the IV Medication Tab.
  
    Corrective Action:
    The BCMA GUI Medication History Report for IV Medications will print
    for large volume IV's on the IV Medication Tab.
  
  
 9. Problem: NOIS TOM-0903-40220
    When a user takes BCMA offline by deselecting the BCMA On-Line check box
    on the GUI BCMA Site Parameters Facility Tab, the user is unable to
    sign in again to the BCMA Site Parameters application and gets the
    following error: "The BCMA Application is not active for this
    division", followed by an application error.
  
    Corrective Action: When a user takes BCMA offline by deselecting the
    BCMA On-Line check box on the GUI BCMA Site Parameters Facility Tab,
    the users will be able to sign in again to the BCMA Site Parameters
    application without receiving the error messages noted above.
  
  
 10. Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30291
     When a user selects a report from the BCMA GUI Reports menu, the
     "Print by" area of the associated dialog box does not display all
     wards in the Ward list box.
      
     Corrective Action:
     The "Print by" area of the BCMA GUI report dialog boxes displays all 
     wards in the Ward list box.
  
  
 11. Problem: NOIS MAD-0203-42078
     When the user attempts to enter an order via the Computerized Patient 
     Record System (CPRS) Med Order Button, the order is being cancelled 
     due to an error, "missing data, unable to file."
  
     Corrective Action:
     The user will be able to successfully enter an order via CPRS Med 
     Order Button without receiving the above error.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions: 
 ====================================
  
 Sites can retrieve VISTA documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
      available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
