Description:
============

 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface 
        (GUI) executable file. Installation of this new GUI is 
         REQUIRED in order for the patch to function.  The new GUI
         MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after the KIDS install in 
         order for the software to function. This Patch includes a 
         Post install that corrects problem number six below. The 
         installation time frame for this post install will vary based
         on the size of the site. This build will validate the correct 
         version of Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI is in
         use. The correct GUI must be installed to support BCMA 
         Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Med Order functionality ***
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
 1.  Problem: NOIS HWH-0204-41213
     The Instructor information does not display in the legend of the 
     Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option, and the audit log
     of the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option.
  
     Corrective Action: The Instructor information displays in the legend  
     of the Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option, and the
     audit log of the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option.
  
 2.  Corrective Action: When student and instructor information is 
     present at login the GUI BCMA CPRS Med Order button is disabled.
  
 3.  Problem: NOIS HUN-0104-20931
     Infusing IV bags are duplicated on a "following" order after the
     order that was active when the IV bag was infusing has become
     "discontinued".  The Virtual Due List (VDL) attempts to display 
     duplicate bags and associates the same IV bags with multiple orders.
  
     Corrective Action:
     When an order with an infusing bag is discontinued, the VDL will
     either continue to display the infusing bag with the discontinued 
     order, or the VDL will display the infusing bag with an active 
     "following" order, but not both.
     
 4.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0304-30352
     If an IV order with an infusing bag expires and the patient's record 
     is not accessed using Inpatient Medications (IPM) (e.g., the
     Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option) the following message may 
     appear, hindering a user's attempt to take action on the order:
     
            "Either the order status or the current scan status displayed 
            on the VDL does not match the status recorded in VistA! This 
            may be due to someone editing the order in VistA or another 
            individual scanning the medication. Your current action will 
            be canceled and the VDL will be refreshed to reflect the most 
            current order information."
  
     Corrective Action:
     A user will be able to take action on an expired IV order having an 
     infusing bag via the BCMA GUI VDL as appropriate.
      
 5.  Problem: NOIS MOU-0304-32821
     The temporary, scratch global ^PSBORDA is automatically monitored and 
     documented via journaling procedures.  It is not necessary to journal 
     this temporary global since it is used solely as a temporary data 
     storage area.
  
     Corrective Action:
     The global ^PSBORDA will be renamed as an appropriate scratch "^TMP" 
     global with the first two subscripts being "PSB" followed by "$J".
  
 6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0404-31737
     With the release of BCMA Version 2 (PSB*2.0), any unit dose 
     order that is displayed on the "IVP/IVPB" tab and administered will 
     have a Ward Stock number generated and placed in the IV Unique 
     ID field (FIELD #.26) of the BCMA Medication Log (FILE #53.79)
     The Ward Stock number is stored in the BCMA Medication Log global and 
     is not displayed on the VDL or any BCMA Report.
    
     Corrective Action:
     A unit dose order that is displayed on the "IVP/IVPB" tab and 
     administered will not have a Ward Stock number generated and placed
     in the IV Unique ID field (FIELD #.26) of the BCMA Medication Log (FILE 
     #53.79). A post install will clean up all incorrect previous entries.
