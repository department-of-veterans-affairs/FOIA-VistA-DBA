Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*115   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*163'

Subject: INCORRECT UPDATE OF ACL TITLE X-REF

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the issue of old title names being listed along with 
 the edited title names in TIU and CPRS.  Previously, when a TIU DOCUMENT 
 TITLE name was edited, the original un-edited name would still appear in 
 TITLE lists.  After installing this patch, only the new name will appear
 in TITLE lists.
  
 This patch also includes a post-install routine TIUPS163 that adds a new
 Index to the TIU DOCUMENTS file (8925). The new Index is "VS" and is a new
 style cross reference for the Secondary Visit field 1207.  This new index
 is necessary to fulfill an Integration Agreement between TIU and PCE.  The
 Integration Agreement is #1902.  This routine is automatically included by
 the KIDS build utility in order to be executed as the Post-Install
 routine.
  
 The post install routine also reindexes the "ACL" cross-reference in file 
 8925.1.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
 ==========================
 It is recommended that this patch be installed during the next VistA 
 downtime if at all possible.  If this is not possible, this patch should be 
 queued to install at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.  
 This patch will create an index on the TIU DOCUMENTS file (8925).  This 
 process can take a considerable amount of time to complete depending on the 
 size of the TIU DOCUMENTS file at your site, however it does not lock the
 whole global and only affects one record at a time.
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
    
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
    select the Installation menu.  
  
 3. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
    options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*163): 
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global 
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*163.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
    respond NO.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
