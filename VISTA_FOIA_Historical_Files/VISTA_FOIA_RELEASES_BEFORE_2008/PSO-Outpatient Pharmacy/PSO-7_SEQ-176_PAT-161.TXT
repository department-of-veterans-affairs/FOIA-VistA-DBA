Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels
 Phase II project for printing prescription labels.
  
 ***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
 This patch changes the format and content of the laser labels print 
 stream. If you are using automated dispensing equipment that relies on 
 the data stream sent to the laser labels port, you have 2 options:
   1. Implement the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI) (available with
      released patch PSO*7*156) or 
   2. Contact your vendor to make adjustments based on the new data stream.
  
 Although implementing OPAI is not mandated at this time, it is expected 
 to be in the future, so option 1 is the preferred solution. By 
 implementing OPAI, future changes to the label format will not affect the 
 dispensing equipment interface.
 *************************************************************************
  
 To fully implement all portions of the new functionality, the 
 following are needed:
   1. Patch PSS*1*87 from Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 (PDM),to provide 
 an API for retrieving warning labels from the new data source.
   2. Patches PSN*4*86 and PSN*4*88 from the National Drug File V. 4.0
 (NDF) to create and populate a new gender field in the WARNING
 LABEL-ENGLISH file (#50.625) and the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH file (#50.626).
   3. Patch PSX*2*54 from the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy V. 2.0
 (CMOP) to modify the way warnings are sent to CMOP.
  
  
  This patch includes:
   1. Referencing a new commercial data source for printing prescription 
 warning labels.        
   2. Printing warning labels and Patient Information Sheets (PMI) by the
 patient's PMI language preference setting.
   3. A new MAILING COMMENTS field (#.081) is added to the OUTPATIENT SITE
 file (#59) to be used for a site to enter anything they would like to 
 show on the Mail Address label. (i.e. whether mailing is "Forwarding 
 service requested" or  "Address service requested"). The PSO SITE INPUT 
 TEMPLATE for the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) is changed to allow the 
 input of data into the new mailing comments.
   4. A new Manual Print of Multi-Rx Forms [PSO LM MULTI-RX PRINT] option
 is added under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option as well as under 
 the OTH hidden action while in the patient's profile to reprint the 
 Multi-Rx Refill Request form on laser label stock without having to
 reprint the entire prescription's labels. The functionality is also
 changed to stop printing the Multi-Rx refill form on reprints.
   5. Various changes to the content/format of the labels - detailed below
 under each label section.
   6. Correction to only print one ScripTalk label when SIG is continued.
 (NOIS CLE-0304-40723. (The other part of this NOIS is addressed in patch
 PSO*7*182, so this NOIS is not included in the associated patch list 
 below)).
   7. A new Signature Log Reprint [PSO SIGLOG REPRINT] option is added
 under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option. (Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
   8. A change was made to not keep exact duplicates of the control code 
 settings (e.g. when running the set-up routine as a test site and again 
 when the patch is installed in production). NOIS PUG-1103-52110
   9. The other NOIS's listed below were for items already included in the
 Laser Labels Phase II specifications.
  
 Bottle label section changes:
 ============================
   1. Currently long SIG's that do not fit on one bottle label print only 4
 lines of SIG on the first bottle label and up to 4 lines on each 
 continuation label. This patch increases the number of lines of the SIG 
 that print on each bottle label to reduce the total number of labels
 needed. This also will allow the overlapping of the multiple labels on the
 bottle to eliminate the need for cutting the labels to make them fit.
   2. The text "Mfr_________" will print for all prescriptions on the same 
 line as the "Discard after" information.
   3. The text "May refill nX by MMM DD,YYYY" or "NO REFILLS LEFT" or "NO 
 REFILL" was added between the "Discard after..." line and the Qty: line.
   4. On the trailing documents, a signature log will print in the bottle 
 label section for the patient to sign for the medications received. 
 (Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
   
 Warning label section changes:
 =============================
   1. A new API will be called to determine which warnings to print.
   2. Warnings will print in English or Spanish depending on the patient's 
 PMI preference.
   3. If there are fewer than five warning labels, the warning labels will 
 be bottom-justified.
   4. If the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) begins
 with numbers 1,2,3,4 or 5. The NO TRANSFER warning label from the RX
 CONSULT file (#54) entry number 20 will print in the appropriate 
 language.
   5. The new data source contains some lengthy warnings, especially the 
 Spanish translation. For the smallest font, this patch allows a 4th line
 of text to print, if needed.
   6. The top warning label was sometimes printing on or over the 
 perforated line. For some fonts, this patch reduces the white space 
 between the lines of the first warning to make it fit.
  
 Mail address section changes:
 ============================
   1. The current date will print in the upper right corner.
   2. If there are any mailing comments defined, they will print after the 
 MAIL field (#.03) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
   3. Patient name will print first name first instead of 
 lastname,firstname.
   4. When the routing is "Window", the word "Window" will be bolded.
  
 Pharmacy fill card section changes:
 ==================================
   1. Seconds will be removed from the label date/time.
   2. A new API will return the text for the DRUG WARNING list. The DRUG 
 WARNING entries will be separated by commas. If an entry in the list does 
 not have an "N" (for "New"), it is from the RX CONSULT file (#54).
 Otherwise it is from the WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH (#50.625) or the 
 WARNING LABEL-SPANISH (#50.626) file.
   3. A new line containing the patient location and status is being added
 beneath the DRUG WARNING list, so the list is being moved up slightly on
 the label.
   4. Patient name and last portion of the social security number are 
 bolded.
   5. If the bottle cap is "non-safety", it will be bolded.
   6. Currently long SIG's that do not fit on one pharmacy fill card label
 print only 4 lines of SIG on the first label and up to 4 lines on each
 continuation label. This patch increases the number of lines of the SIG 
 that print on each pharmacy fill card label to reduce the total number of
 labels needed.
   7. The words "3rd Party Rx" and the NDC number are added when that 
 information is available. (Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
  
 Patient fill section changes:
 ============================
   1. The barcode will print every time even if there are no refills.
   2. The site telephone number will print when the "PHONE IN OR MAIL THIS 
 REFILL REQUEST" prints.
   3. The text "n refills left until MMM DD,YYYY is changed to "May refill 
 nX by MMM DD,YYYY".
  
 Prescription Document PMI section changes:
 =========================================
   1. The PMI will print in the patient's language preference.
   2. The white spaces between sections of the PMI document will be 
 reduced to result in a few more lines fitting on the page.
   3. If there are more than 5 warning labels, the additional warnings 
 will print at the top of the PMI section.
  
 Trailing document changes:
 =========================
   1. The patient's phone number followed by an underline will print on 
 the address change form.
   2. In the Allergies/ADR section, the name and last six digits of the 
 social security number will be made larger and will be bolded.
   3. In the Allergies/ADR section, if the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), 
 TYPE field (#2) type equals "W" for any prescription printed for this 
 patient in the current print job, then the word "INPATIENT" will print 
 on the line following the patient name.
   4. In the Allergies/ADR section, if some sections do not have data, the 
 header will not print. If no information exists, "No Assessment Made" 
 will print after the Verified Allergies heading.
   5. In the refill narrative or copay narrative sections, if there are 
 more than seven lines from the original text, only the first seven lines 
 will print. (They could appear as more than seven lines if there is some 
 wrapping of the text).
   6. If the Multi-Rx refill section is blank, the SITE NUMBER field 
 (#.06) from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) will print bottom right
 justified.
  
 A utility routine is included in this patch to change some of the control
 codes in the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2). 
 Once the patch is installed, running the routine PSOLLU4 in programmer
 mode will make slight adjustments to PATIENT FILL INITIALIZATION, 
 PHARMACY FILL DOCUMENT WARNING, MAILING LABEL INITIALIZATION, and RETURN 
 MAIL INITIALIZATION settings.
 Note: you must have your FileMan access set to '@' to run the routine.
  
 Note: For sites implementing laser labels for the first time, before 
 running PSOLLU4, run PSOLLU2 and PSOLLU3 in that order to adjust other 
 control codes. The instructions for running PSOLLU2 and PSOLLU3 are the 
 same as for PSOLLU4.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running
  tasks. Do not install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are
  using the software. Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.
  
  
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*161):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*161.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  9. A utility routine is included in this patch to change some of the 
     control codes in the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2) for the laser labels
     printers. Once the patch is installed, running the routine PSOLLU4 in
     programmer mode will make slight adjustments to PATIENT FILL
     INITIALIZATION, PHARMACY FILL DOCUMENT WARNING, MAILING LABEL
     INITIALIZATION, and RETURN MAIL INITIALIZATION settings.
     Note: your FileMan access must be set to '@' to run the routine.
    
     Note: For sites implementing laser labels for the first time, before 
     running PSOLLU4, run PSOLLU2 and PSOLLU3 in that order to adjust other
     control codes. The instructions for running PSOLLU2 and PSOLLU3 are
     the same as for PSOLLU4.
