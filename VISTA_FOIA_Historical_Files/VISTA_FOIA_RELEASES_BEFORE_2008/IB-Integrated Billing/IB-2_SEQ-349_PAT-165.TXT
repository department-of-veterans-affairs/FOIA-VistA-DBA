 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD119316      BILLING LAG TIME REPORT MODIFICATIONS
  
  
  ****Listed below are the issues resolved with this patch****
  
  
  1) Get most recent "Date of Check Out" 
  ======================================
   
  Problem
  =======
  Currently the report is using the check out date of the last encounter 
  to be checked in. However, the last encounter of the day may not have
  been the last encounter to be checked out.
   
  Resolution
  ==========
  Modified the software so it only keeps the check out date if it is 
  greater than the previous date.  This will ensure the most recent date is
  stored.
  
  
  2) In determining "Date of Check Out" use only encounter clinics that 
  match the clinic on the bill
  =====================================================================
  
  Problem
  =======
  When determining the check out date, it uses the bill encounter date to 
  search through all encounters that day for that patient and return the 
  last check out date. The problem is that it is sometimes using 
  encounters that aren't related to the bill.
  
  Resolution
  ==========
  Use only encounters for clinics with procedures on the bill.
  This will screen out encounters not on the bill.
  
   
  3) Exclude encounters checked out after the bill was Authorized
  ===============================================================
    
  Problem
  =======   
  The Central Business Office has determined that bill encounters that are 
  checked out after the bill has been authorized should be excluded from 
  the report.
   
  Resolution
  ==========  
  Before using an encounter check out date, verify that it was checked out 
  before the bill was authorized.  In the case where the most recent check 
  out date is after the bill was authorized, the last check out date 
  before the bill was authorized will be used.
   
     
  4) Get most recent "Date PTF Transmitted"    
  =========================================
   
  Problem
  =======
  Currently the software gets the last date the Patient Treatment File 
  (PTF) entry was "Released for Transmission", and using that date, it gets
  the date it was actually transmitted.  The problem is that an earlier
  "Released for Transmission" date might have actually been transmitted 
  more recently.
   
  Resolution
  ==========
  Modified the software to search through all of a PTF's entries "Released 
  for Transmission" dates to find the most recent "Transmission Date". 
   
       
  5) Exclude PTF transmission dates that occur after the authorization 
  date of the bill.
  =========================================================================
   
  Problem
  =======
  The Central Business Office has determined that the report will exclude 
  PTF transmission dates that occur after the authorization of the bill.
    
  Resolution
  ==========
  Before using a PTF transmission date, verify it was transmitted before 
  the bill was authorized.  In the case where the most recent transmission
  date is after the bill was authorized, the last transmission date before
  the bill was authorized will be used.
   
     
  6) Report Display
  =================
   
  Problem
  =======
  Currently when displaying a record with late insurance on the detailed 
  report an "*" prints after the first date.
   
  Resolution
  ==========    
  The Chief Business Office has determined the "*" should print after the
  bill number, not after the date.
