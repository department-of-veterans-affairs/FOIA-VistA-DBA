 Problem:
 In different situations, the CANCEL DATE field (#26.1) in the 
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is not being populated.
  
  These situations are highlighted following...
  
 -When a Vista D/C (Discontinue) is chosen.
  
 -When a Vista Renew is chosen.
  
 -When a CPRS and Vista Change/Edit are chosen and the '*'Schedule field
 has been changed.
  
 -When a CPRS D/C (Discontinue) and CPRS Renew are chosen.
  
 -Other Situations whereby the cancel date field is not being populated...
  
 -Vista Autocancel due to Admission.
 -Vista Date of Death
 -Vista Drug Interaction/Verfiy

 Solution:
 This patch will correct these issues by setting the cancel date 
 field equal to the last dispensed date.  In situations where the last
 dispensed date is null, the cancel date will be set with today's date.
