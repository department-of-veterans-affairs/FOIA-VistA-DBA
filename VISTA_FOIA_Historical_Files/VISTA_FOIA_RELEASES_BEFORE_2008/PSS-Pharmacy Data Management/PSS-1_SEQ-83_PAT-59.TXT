Subject: INPATIENT MEDICATION ORDERS FOR OUTPATIENTS AND NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Input Template
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. The Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients project will allow a
 user the ability to order unit dose medications for outpatients. This is 
 accomplished through modifications to Inpatient Medications V. 5.0,
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0, and Scheduling V. 5.3.
 The purpose of this patch is to create three new fields in the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55). In the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62), the CLINIC field
 (#130) and the APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#131) have been added. In the
 IV multiple (#100), the APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#139) has been added.
  
 2. A new parameter has been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). It 
 is the AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS field (#26.8). This new parameter will allow 
 sites to control whether or not Inpatient Medication Orders for 
 Outpatients are automatically discontinued during patient movements. This 
 parameter will only be effective if sites are using Inpatient Medications 
 V. 5.0 to control discontinues on patient movements. If the site is using
 the CPRS auto-dc rules, this parameter will have no effect.
  
 3. As a part of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special
 Focus Group IRA project, this patch modifies the definition of schedules
 in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). To accomplish this, the 
 following changes are being made to the PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT input 
 template:
      a. Do not allow entry of a schedule with the name of OTHER. 
      b. Do not allow entry of administration times for odd schedules. 
      c. Display the calculated frequency to the user.
  
 4. Based on the upcoming requirement from the Joint Commission on
 Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, schedule names that are
 considered dangerous will no longer be allowed. The four schedules that 
 will no longer be allowed are: QD, HS, TIW and QOD. These schedules 
 cannot be used either alone or as part of a schedule name. For example: 
 QD is not allowed. Neither is QD ONCE.
  
 5. The Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus Group IRA
 project will prevent users from entering free text schedules for inpatient
 medication orders. This patch helps accomplish this by changing the
 validation of schedules entered through Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) V. 1.0. This validation requires that schedules be defined in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or be a valid day-of-week, PRN or
 administration time schedule before allowing the schedule to be added to
 an inpatient order.
  
 6. A provider entering an order into Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) V. 1.0 must be permitted to place a limitation on the duration of
 an inpatient medication order. This capability exists for Unit Dose orders
 and Inpatient IV orders, but not for IV Fluid orders. This patch helps 
 accomplish this by adding a new field to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), 
 IV multiple (#100) called REQUESTED IV LIMITATION (#152).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 CPRS GUI version 25 consists of three patches. The patches are combined in
 host file OR_3_195_PSJ_PSS.KID in order to simplify installation at
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Installation of this host
 file should be coordinated among the packages affected since only one
 installation is necessary. The patches are:
  
  PSS*1*59       PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT
  PSJ*5*111      INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
  OR*3*195       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
