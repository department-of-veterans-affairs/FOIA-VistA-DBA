 *************************************************************************
  
 This Patient Care Encounter (PCE) patch PX*1.0*184, along with the 
 Scheduling Application System patch, SD*5.3*495, and the Hospital Inquiry
 (HINQ) patch, DVB*4.0*58, is being released in a single KIDS software
 distribution (host file) DVB_4_P58.KID. This patch description includes
 only the Informational portion of PX*1.0*184. Also as part of this
 project are patches PRCA*4.5*250 and IB*2.0*369. These patches must be
 installed before the host file DVB_4_P58.KID.
  
 Please refer to the "Software Retrieval" and "Installation Instructions"
 sections of the DVB*4.0*58 patch description for instructions on how
 to acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
 *************************************************************************
   
 This patch addresses the Automated Service Connected Designation (ASCD)
 project which will automate the Service Connected (SC) decision for
 outpatient encounters using mapped ICD9/Rated Disability Codes at the time
 the clinician enters the ICD9 code for the encounter within the Patient
 Care Encounter (PCE) and Scheduling packages ONLY.
  
 In the current clinical work environment providers are requested to
 designate, at the point of care, if a specific patient care encounter is
 service connected based on available disability rating information. This
 software will computerize the clinician's process at each encounter, i.e.
 mark the encounter service connected (SC) or non-service connected (NSC)
 as appropriate via the PCE & Scheduling packages.  Thus, when a provider
 or clinician chooses the diagnosis code within one of these packages for
 the encounter, the system will automatically determine if the diagnosis is
 related to the veteran's established SC conditions, and will likewise
 automatically make the proper SC/NSC determination.
  
 Additionally, the Class III Service Connection Objective Update Tool
 (SCOUT) software has been converted and implemented as Class I Automated
 Service Connected Designation (ASCD).  This software recognizes
 potentially billable encounters for SC veterans that cannot be
 automatically matched to rated disability codes as well as potentially
 non-billable encounters which were designated NSC but should be SC.  These
 encounters are displayed in reports for coders and/or utilization review
 staff to review the patient visit information and change the incorrect
 SC/NSC designation so they can be billed appropriately.
  
 Patch PX*1.0*184 addresses the following changes/enhancements:
  
 o  Modifications were made to the outpatient encounter checkout process to
    determine if the encounter needs additional review for final service
    connected designation.
 o  Modifications were made to check-out screen under the section "Patient's 
    Service Connection and Rated Disabilities:" to display the VBA DX CODE 
    number before the Rated Disabilities (VA) name.
 o  Modifications were made to PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor  
    [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER] option to allow users to change the ASCD 
    value which will be displayed as the default.  This will allow users to
    access encounters that are not set for review and are not accessible
    via the ASCD review options.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 o  Routine PXBAPI22 was modified to call the Scheduling API routine, SDSCAPI, 
    to determine the response to the question "Was treatment for SC Condition?"
    after each diagnosis code entry.
 o  Routine PXCEVFI1 was modified to capture the IEN of the diagnosis code that
    the user has entered in a local variable.  It is used to make the SC
    determination for each diagnosis code.
 o  Routine PXCEVFI2 was modified to add the VBA DX CODE number to be displayed
    before the Rated Disabilities (VA) name.
 o  Routine PXBAPI21 was modified to correct a problem identified during 
    testing where the classification questions were being asked when
    entering a standalone encounter for a non-count clinic or an inpatient.
  
  
 Functional:
 -----------
 o  The encounter diagnosis code data entry process has been automated to
    determine the response to the question "Was treatment for SC Condition?"
    after each diagnosis code entry.
 o  The VBA DX CODE number will be displayed before the Rated Disabilities 
    (VA) name as follows:-
  
      Rated Disabilities: 6260 TINNITUS (10%-SC)
                          ---- 
 o  The classification questions are no longer asked for a non-count clinic 
     or inpatient standalone encounter.
