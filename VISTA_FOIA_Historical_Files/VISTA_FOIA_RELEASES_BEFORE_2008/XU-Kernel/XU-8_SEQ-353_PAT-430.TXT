  HealtheVet VistA applications that use KAAJEE for Authentication
  will encounter an error when a user attempts to login.
  This only happens when the Administrative Parent associated with
  the current login station has no station number defined
  in the Institution file (#4).
  
  As part of the login process via KAAJEE, the XUS KAAJEE GET USER INFO
  Remote Procedure is invoked to return user demographic information.
  When this information is returned to KAAJEE on the Java side,
  KAAJEE can encounter an error as it attempts to parse the data.
  An example of this situation occurs when an Administrative Parent has no
  station number defined.  This causes an empty string to be passed to
  KAAJEE and in turn causes KAAJEE to skip to the next data element.  This
  causes the user demographic data to shift resulting in an error due
  to misaligned data.
  
  Part one of this fix is addressed by this patch.  This patch will return
  an '^' for the Administrative Parent station number whenever it is not 
  defined.  This will prevent the Java-side code of KAAJEE from skipping.
  
  Part two of this fix will be addressed later by a Java-side patch to 
  KAAJEE to convert this '^' back to an empty string.
