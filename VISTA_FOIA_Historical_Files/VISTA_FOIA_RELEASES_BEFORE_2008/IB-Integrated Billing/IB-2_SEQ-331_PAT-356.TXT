 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD63676  Non Providers Not Screened in Procedures Multiple 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  The PROVIDER (#18) field in the PROCEDURES multiple (#399.0304) of the
  BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file points to the NEW PERSON (#200) file and allows
  selection of anyone in that file.  If a user accidentally enters a non-
  provider in that field, the bill will not be paid and will have to be
  edited and resubmitted.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The data dictionary entry for the PROVIDER (#18) field will have a 'screen'
  applied which will limit acceptable entries to personnel who have been
  assigned a PERSON CLASS (#8932.1) field entry in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.
  The existence of the PERSON CLASS (#8932.1) field entry is an indicator that
  the person is a member of the medical staff.
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 2) HD64317  IB315 entry file 350.8/*232 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  The IB error code 'IB315' is no longer valid and was to be deleted from the
  IB ERROR (#350.8) file by patch IB*2.0*232.  Due to a small oversight in
  that patch, the entry was not removed.  This does not cause any actual
  problem in VistA but it is an extraneous entry in that file and might as
  well be cleaned up.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The pre-init routine will execute code which will delete the IB315 entry
  from the IB ERROR (#350.8) file.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 3) HD64380   Held Charges Report (PTH-1104-20448) 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When a user runs the Held Charges Report [IB OUTPUT HELD CHARGES], requests
  that it be Queued for a later time, and indicates different printer
  parameters than the standard default for that printer, the output does not
  honor the parameter changes.  Specifically, the printer is designated as an
  80 character width device but the report requires 132 characters.  Selecting
  the alternate width with a smaller font did not work if the report were
  queued.
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The report program was not passing the alternate parameters to the queuing
  function.  The routine IBOHLD1 is modified by this patch to pass three
  additional parameters - the terminal type, the margin width and the page
  length.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 4) HD64425   PROVIDER ID QUERY REPORT - TOTAL IS WRONG 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When patch IB*2.0*232 was in development a special routine, ZQ232, was
  distributed to the sites to help clean up insurance data.  Later, a slightly
  altered version of this function was released as option Provider ID Query
  [IBCE PROVIDER ID QUERY] using routine IBCEQ1.  The new version has an
  incorrect value for TOTAL # OF ERRORS/WARNINGS: on the last page.  The field
  always shows zero no matter how many errors were listed on the report
  although the earlier ZQ232 version had worked correctly.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The report program was missing a line of code to add up the errors and
  warnings.  The code has been corrected and the summary now provides the
  same results as the ZQ232 version.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 5) HD64697   ADD OUTSIDE LAB CHARGES TO MAP 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When patch IB*2.0*232 was being developed, a change was made to entry number
  783 (TOTAL OUTSIDE LAB CHARGES) in the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION (#364.6)
  file to make the field no longer available for output on the 837 EDI extract
  for claims.  This was an inadvertent change which needs to be fixed. The
  value for the CALCULATE ONLY OR OUTPUT (#.11) field should be changed from
  "CALCULATE ONLY" to "OUTPUT." 
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The pre-init routine will change the value of the CALCULATE ONLY OR OUTPUT 
  (#.11) field in the designated record to "OUTPUT" as described above.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 6) HD64863   IBJDF51 Spreadsheet (Trans # creates problem) 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When the number of entries in the AR TRANSACTION (#433) file exceeds
  9,999,999 the CHAMPVA/TRICARE Follow-up Report no longer works correctly for
  the Excel spreadsheet version.  Some records were being skipped.  During the
  research on this issue it was discovered that a similar problem could exist
  in the FIRST PARTY FOLLOW-UP REPORT and in the MISCELLANEOUS BILLS 
  FOLLOW-UP REPORT. 
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
  The routines which run the three reports mentioned above were modified to
  allow for 999,999,999 entries in the AR TRANSACTION file.
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 7) HD65904   Problem with Miscellaneous Bills Follow-up Reports 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When running the Miscellaneous Bills Follow-up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP MISC
  BILLS] a user noted that some bills were showing up in the wrong division
  when the report was sorted by Division.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  An analysis of the code in routine IBJDF61 showed that the wrong function
  was being called to determine Division.  A different function is available
  that returns the correct division in this situation.  The report has been
  modified to use this alternate function ($$DIV^IBJDF51).  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 8) HD117969  CHAMPVA/TRICARE Follow-Up Report Detail vs. Summary problem 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  It has been noticed that the summary section of the CHAMPVA/TRICARE
  Follow-up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP CHAMPVA/TRICARE] does not always include
  all of the detail lines when choosing the SHARING AGREEMENTS Detail version.
  The Summary lists the correct number of included records but not all of the
  detail lines were printed.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  A small problem in the code was allowing the records to be totalled for
  the summary but causing some to be skipped in the printing process.  This
  has been corrected and all of the detail lines that make up the totals
  are now printed.
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 9) HD118376 - MRA Filing Error 
    HD123700 - Message storage errors on bill.  (Duplicate)
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  The application is assuming that the number of 'units' is coming in on
  the MRA 835 for anesthesia claims when, in fact, the number of 'minutes'
  is being returned.  This change happened in late 2005 when Emdeon
  started sending the minutes to TrailBlazer in the claim.  MRA's for
  anesthesia claims have not been able to be filed correctly since that
  time.  
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  This patch will modify code in the routine IBCEOB1 to find matches using
  the anesthesia minutes in addition to the existing check using the number
  of units.  Previously this routine was trying to match up number of units
  with the anesthesia minutes.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 10) HD131138   Missing Mail Group - CMOP transmissions fail.  
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  A CMOP transmission failure can occur if the IB SITE PARAMETERS (#350.9)
  file is not configured correctly.  The problem occurs if the
  USER ALERTS (#.14) field is set to YES, and the COPAY BACKGROUND ERROR
  GROUP (#.09) and COPAY EXEMPTION MAIL GROUP (#.13) fields are left blank.
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  This patch adds code that will default to the IB EDI SUPERVISOR mail group
  if the two COPAY groups mentioned above are left blank. This will provide
  a valid mail group and the CMOP transmissions will not fail.
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 11) HD134835   Insurance Buffer Error.  
     HD131701   Error <UNDEF>BR+1^DIE0   (Duplicate)
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  Error generated when processing the Insurance Buffer. When using the
  Patient Policy Edit protocol and using the "^" to jump down to the
  Subscriber ID field the following error is generated: <UNDEF>BR+1^DIE0.
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The DIE call in the routine IBCNBEE will be modified to disallow "^"
  forward jumping.  The jump was bypassing the setting of some required
  values and resulted in an error. The "^" will still be allowed for use
  to back out or exit.
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
   
 12) HD137911  <UNDEFINED>BULL1+5^IBTUBUL 
     HD145085  Error Running Send Test Unbilled Amounts Bulletin   (Duplicate)
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When users try to run the Send Test Unbilled Amounts Bulletin [IBT SEND
  TEST UNBILLED MESS] option they get an <UNDEFINED> type error.  Patch
  IB*2.0*155 added several new lines of data to the regular Unbilled Amounts
  Bulletin but did not add those same lines to the test version of that
  bulletin.
   
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  Several new variables needed to be initialized in routine IBTUBUL in order
  for the test version of the bulletin to supply the required data to the
  bulletin printing function.  The test version will now match the real
  version line for line.  
   
  --------                    --------------------                    --------
