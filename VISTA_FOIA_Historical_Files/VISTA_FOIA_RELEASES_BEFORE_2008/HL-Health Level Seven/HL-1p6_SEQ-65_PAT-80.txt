Description: 
============

 Test sites:    Grand Junction, Greater Los Angeles Regional
                Healthcare (West Los Angeles), 
                Health Eligibility Center (HEC)
                San Francisco, Oakland CIOFO
  
 NOIS:          ISF-0900-60520, ATG-0101-32967
  
 Note:          This patch requires that KIDS build HL*1.6*65
                and KIDS build HL*1.6*72 be installed.
  
 The MSH segment of an HL7 message holds a PROCESSING ID field.  Under most 
 circumstances, the value of this PROCESSING ID field should be obtained 
 from the PROCESSING ID field of the HL7 package parameters.  However, the 
 HL7 package parameters can be overridden, and the PROCESSING ID can
 instead by obtained from the protocol used during the process of message
 creation.  Prior to this patch, the PROCESSING ID was always based on the
 protocol; under no circumstances was the PROCESSING ID obtained from the
 HL7 package parameters.  This patch fixes this problem, and now the
 PROCESSING ID is built correctly from the parameters or the protocol.
  
 In addition to the invalid use of a local variable, HLCSHDR1 contained
 an invalid global reference to ^HL(772) that has now been corrected
 to reference ^HLMA.
  
 The VA Kernel checksums for the routines being changed (calculated using
 CHECK^XTSUMBLD) are listed below.

 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums after patch
 installation.
  
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines being
        changed are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at
        this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options
        listed below.
  
           Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
           TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
        DSM SITES:  Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        This is done using the 'Installation' menu's 'Install
        Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD]' menu option. When using this
        menu option to install the HL*1.6*80 build, you will be asked
        several questions.  The questions, and the answers you should
        supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*80>
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
  
    6.  Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
        DSM SITES:  If you previously disabled a HL7 UCX Service
        for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
    7.  DSM sites should rebuild their mapped routine set if necessary.
  
    8.  Start Link Manager using the 'TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
        START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
