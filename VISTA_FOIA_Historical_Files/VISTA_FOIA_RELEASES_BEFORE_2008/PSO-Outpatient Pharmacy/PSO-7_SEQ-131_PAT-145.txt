Description:
============

 This is the Phase I patch of the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Project
 (TPB). This project provides functionality for the "Medication Prescribed 
 by Non-VA Physicians" to accommodate the Veterans Health Administration 
 (VHA) Directive 2003-047 that allows Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
 to furnish medications from non-VA physicians. It mandates that for
 eligible veterans that meet certain criteria, VHA will fill prescriptions
 written by non-VA physicians. To determine eligibility, a patient must
 meet the following criteria:
  
 1) The patient must be a veteran.
  
 2) The veteran must be enrolled for VA health care system before
    July 25, 2003.
  
 3) Before July 25,2003, the veteran must have requested their first 
    primary care appointment with the VA.
  
 4) The veteran must have no active prescriptions dispensed by the local 
    VHA pharmacy, excluding Supply and Investigational items, for the past 
    485 days from October 22, 2003.
  
 5) The veteran must be waiting more than 30 days for their first 
    appointment with a Primary Care Physician on or after October 22, 
    2003, or the veteran is deemed eligible via an Electronic Wait
    List/Scheduling extract run at each local site.
  
  
  
 This patch is being sent out as a combined build, along with patch 
 SD*5.3*300.
             
  
 Outpatient Pharmacy will provide the following functionality in this 
 patch:
  
 1. A Post-Install routine will scan through the PATIENT file (#2)
 and the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3), and will populate the new Outpatient
 Pharmacy TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) with patients eligible for the
 Transitional Pharmacy Benefit. Patients will either be entered into the
 file as eligible, or ineligible. If they are entered into the file as
 ineligible, an exclusion reason will also be entered into the file. Please
 refer to the documentation for more details.
   
 The average run time of the Post-Install at the test sites was 1 hour.
  
  
 2. The following new options are provided in this patch:
    a. A new report option, TPB Patient Report [PSO TPB PATIENT REPORT], 
       will be provided to display the patients in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file
       (#52.91). Various sort criteria are provided.
    b. The Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Patient Enter/Edit [PSO TPB  
       PATIENT ENTER/EDIT] option will allow sites to add new patients, and
       edit existing patients. Note: This option will be set initially to
       "Out of Order", until the post-install runs to completion.
    c. The TPB Institution Letter Enter/Edit [PSO TPB INSTITUTION LETTERS]
       option allows the user to edit each TPB institution's information
       elements that are to be printed on the letters to be sent to the
       patients.
    d. The Report TPB Patients Letters Printed/NOT Printed [PSO TPB LETTERS
       PRINTED REPORT] option provides the user the ability to generate a
       report of patients' letters printed or not printed.
    e. The Print TPB Patient Letter(s) [PSO TPB PRINT LETTERS] option
       provides the ability to print TPB letters to be sent to patients.
