Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is an informational patch notifying the sites of new and updated
 functionality contained in the V3.08 release of the Voluntary Service System
 (VSS) software.  An addendum to the Voluntary Service System (VSS) User
 Manual is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the IO
 Field Offices.
 
 
 =========================
 NEW/CHANGED FUNCTIONALITY
 =========================
 
 Version 3.08 of the Voluntary Service System software contains enhancements
 for Donations and corrects some NOISs.  Version 3.08 includes:
 
 1. New Donation Menu
 A new menu has been created for Donations.  It contains all functionality for
 Donations with exception to the Donation Site Parameters. The Donation Site
 Parameters option can be found under the Maintenance Menu.  The following is
 the layout of the Donations Menu:
 
   Donations
     Reports
       Detail (Daily)
         Generate Memo
         Generate Receipt
         Grand Total of Donations
     Add/Edit Donation
     Search
 
 2. Donation Search/Data View
 A new search option has been created to allow a site to search the database
 for donations within a specific set of parameters.  On the user interface,
 the user can select the following searchable parameters:
 
   Station
   Donation Date Range, From and To
   Individual (Example: SMI for smith, upper or lower case lookup)
   Organization (Example: Ame)
   Local Branch (Example: 132)
   Other Groups (Example: Fir)
   Donation Type: Check, Cash, Item, Activity, All
   Value (Example: $100.00)
   General Post Fund (Example: 2213)
   Check Number (Example: 392)
   Reference (Example: Menlo)
   In Memory Of (Example: Ralph)
 
 The Station and the Donation Date Range are the only mandatory fields for the
 search.  All other fields are optional and if left blank, or the default of
 All, then all donations will be returned.
 
 The user is also given a list of all data elements stored within the
 donations package.  The user can select which data elements, using a
 checkbox, to display on the data view.  The data view will show the donations
 returned using the selected search criteria.
 
 The search results can be load into an excel spreadsheet using the following
 steps:
   a. After displaying the results, from the browser window click on Edit and
 Select All.
   b. Next, from the browser window click on Edit and Copy.
   c. Finally, start Excel with a new workbook open.  Click on Edit and Paste.
  The result set can now be used within excel.  Sites can save the excel
 spreadsheet on their local hard drive.
 
 3. Donation Site Parameters
 The Site Parameters option under the Maintenance Menu has been modified to
 allow sites to select specific donation site parameters.  Included in the
 site parameters are:
 
 GPF Accounts: Alphanumeric up to 25 characters.  This is site-specific
 General Post Fund account that the user can select when inputting a donation.
 A site can have multiple General Post Fund accounts.  A GPF account can only
 be deleted if no donation values are applied to it.  A site can use the
 Donation Search/Data View to locate specific GPF accounts linked to
 individual donations.
 
 Voluntary Service Signature Line: Type the name of the person signing
 donation letters.  This name will appear at the bottom of the letter. 
 Letters will be included in a future version.
 
 Director's Signature Line: Type the name of the Director signing donation
 letters.  If the parameter below, Set Value Amount for Director's Signature,
 is entered, use the Director's Signature Line instead of the Voluntary
 Service Signature Line on the donation letter.  Letters will be included in a
 future version.
 
 Set Value Amount for Director's Signature:  If this value is entered and the
 donation amount exceeds this value, use the Director's Signature Line on the
 donation letter instead of the Voluntary Signature Line.  Letters will be
 included in a future version.
 
 VA Letter Head: Yes or No selection.  If set to Yes, the VA Letter Head with
 the name of the facility and address will print at the top of the donation
 letters (see functionality below for the ability to add/edit the station's
 address).  If set to No, the VA Letter Head will not print at the top of the
 donation letters.  Letters will be included in a future version.
 
 Reference: Alphanumeric up to 50 characters.  This is site specific Reference
 that the user can select when inputting a donation.  An example is Palo Alto
 where they would like to search donations by clinic.  Using this field, they
 can enter their clinics and link the donation to a specific clinic.  A site
 can have multiple References.  A Reference can only be deleted if no
 donations are assigned to it.  A site can use the Donation Search/Data View
 to locate specific References linked to individual donations.
 
 4. Grand Total of Donations Report
 A new report has been added named Grand Total of Donations Report under the
 Detail (Daily) Menu.  The inputs for the report are: Station, Date Range From
 and To (both are month, day, and year), selectable Donor Type: Organization,
 Individual, Other Groups, Individual & Organization, Individual & Other
 Groups, and All), Summary or Detailed Report (the Summary report will just
 show Subtotals and Grand Totals), Reference all or selected, and the Print
 Format.  If the Donor Type is Organization, the user can select the
 Organizations to print on the report.  The Reference is selected from the
 site parameters for the selected station.  If the Donor Type is Individual &
 Organization, the report is sorted by the Organization followed by the
 Individual.  If the Donor Type is Individual and Other Groups, the report is
 sorted by the Other Groups followed by the Individual.  Subtotals by
 Organization are included.  If the Donor Type is Organization, the report is
 sorted by Organization and then by date.  
 
 5. Add/Edit Donation Changes
 The Add/Edit Donation option has been changed for this version.  The
 following is a list of the major changes:
 
 a. General Post Fund Breakout
 Sites now have the functionality to apply a single donation value to multiple
 unlimited GPF accounts.  Sites can also select the generic GPF account named
 None.  A site can edit a donation and change the GPF account once it has been
 posted.  To remove a GPF account from a donation, a site should select the
 GPF account of None.
 
 b. Five CC Fields Added
 Sites can enter five CC fields for a donation.  The CC fields will be used
 with letters in a future version.
 
 c. Family Contact Field Added
 A family contact field has been added to the donation.  The family contact
 field will be used with letters in a future version.
 
 d. Check Number Field Required
 The check number field is now required for a donation type of check.
 
 e. Individual/Organization Type on Add/Edit Donation Problem
 If you select the donor type of Individual and enter a name and then change
 the type to Organization, it printed the individual's name (as an Individual
 versus Organization) on the Donation Memo.  To fix this, change the default
 donor type to none and force the user to select the type.  Once the type is
 selected, allow the user to enter the rest of the donation fields based on
 type.  This is reported in NOIS PAL-0604-60145.
 
 f. Required Fields on Add/Edit Donation Problem
 The following fields are required prior to entering a donation, but they do
 not have an asterisk next to them indication they are required: organization,
 individual and organization, affiliate, and individual and affiliate.  This
 is reported in NOIS BAY-0604-30148.
 g. Change Order of Fields
 The display order of the fields and location on the screen have been changed
 in the user interface when entering or editing a donation.
 
 h. Turn off Check Number
 If the Donation Type does not equal Check, turn off the Check Number and
 Check Date fields.
 
 i. Eliminate in Memory Of
 For Individual and Activity Donations, Eliminate In Memory Of.
 
 j. Change Donor Types
 Change the Donor Type from Individual & Affiliate to Other Groups &
 Individual.
 Change the Donor Type Individual & Organization to Organization & Individual.
 Change the Donor Type from Affiliate to Other Groups.
 
 k. Change Description Field to Remarks
 Change the word Description to Remarks.
 
 l. Show Id Number of Donation Posted
 After posting a donation, show the user the Id number of the donation posted.
 The Id number can be used by voluntary staff to track and follow up on the
 printing of letters.
 
 6. Generate Donations Receipt Problem
 This version fixes the error that occurs when printing a donation receipt or
 memo.  The error reads: Value either too large or too small for an INT 16. 
 This is reported in NOIS UNY-0604-10282.
 
 7. Add/Edit Station Address
 This version provides the functionality to allow the VSS manager at the
 station to add or edit the address of a station.  It does not allow the VSS
 manager to change the name of the station.  Central Office manages the name
 of the stations.  Functionality was added in version 3.07 to allow Central
 Office to add/edit the station name.  The ability to change the address at
 the station will be allowed for any person that has access to the Station
 Edit option under the Maintenance Menu (in most cases the VSS manager).
 
 8. Remove Age on VS28 Report and Fix Visit Count
 The age is removed from the VS28 report and is replaced with A for Adult or Y
 for Youth.  This version also fixes the problem with the visit count as
 reported in NOIS MIW-0704-41629.
 
 9. Hours and Years Award Problem
 Sites can no longer manually post hours and years awards.  This is reported
 in NOIS MWV-0504-21125.
 
 10. Volunteers on Meal List Twice Problem
 A volunteer will no longer appear on the meal list two times.  This is
 reported in NOIS MAD-0304-41312.
 
 11. Remove Volunteer from Meal List
 If a volunteer does not want lunch and they are removed from the maintenance
 screen, their name still appears on the Dietetics Meal List.  This is
 reported in TOG-1203-11691.
 
 12. Daily Volunteer List Not Alphabetical
 The Daily Volunteer List does not always print alphabetically.  This is
 reported in NOIS DET-0604-41261.
 
 13. Voluntary Service Directory Display Problem
 Under the Voluntary Service Directory, the Chief and VISN Liaison fields
 always display No regardless of what is set in the database.  This is
 reported in NOIS TOG-0604-11701.
 
 14. Orphan Hours
 There are currently hours in the hours table linked to station where the
 volunteer does not have a Volunteer Station Profile set up for the station. 
 Most of the entries are from migration.  This problem causes some of the
 counts to be off (hours are correct).  There are currently over 300
 volunteers that have this problem.  The solution to clean these up is by
 creating a Volunteer Station Profile for the hours and then terminating the
 volunteer.
 
 15. Remove Merge from VSS Menu
 This version will remove the option for the Merge functionality.  Sites that
 have a need to merge volunteers should submit a NOIS.
 
 16. Annual Report Optimized
 The Annual Report has been rewritten in an attempt to increase the speed. 
 This is a known problem that several large sites have trouble with timeouts
 when they attempt to print the Annual Report (for example: Bay Pines).
 
 17. Address Labels Problem Selecting Volunteers
 This version fixes the problem that occurs when selecting 30-40 volunteers to
 print addresses.  An error will occur as identified in NOIS CHY-0903-52043.
