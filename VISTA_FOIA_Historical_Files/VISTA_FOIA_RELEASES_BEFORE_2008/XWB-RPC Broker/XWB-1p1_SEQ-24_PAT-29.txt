Subject: Client install for ESSO and Shared Broker

Category: 
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This patch provides an installation executable for advanced RPCBroker 
 features that must be installed, or at least registered, on the client 
 workstations.  
  
 The xuesap.tlb type library is related to the Enterprise 
 Single Sign-On which uses the user's NT Username and Domain via an 
 Authentication Proxy Server to connect the user to a VistA server.
  
 The RPCSharedBrokerSessionMgr1.exe is the session manager for the 
 SharedRPCBroker which permits applications compiled with it to use a 
 single partition on the VistA server when the AllowShared property is set
 to True.
  
 These are required to support the capabilities of RPCBroker versions 
 which are being compiled into future applications of VistA Client 
 applications.
