Subject: CLEAN UP INGREDIENTS AND INTERACTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 It has been noted that several sites have made local entries in the DRUG
 INGREDIENTS file (#50.416).  This should not have been done.  Patch
 PSN*4*89 changed the data dictionary of that file to prevent further
 additions.  Some of these local entries may have already been overwritten
 by national entries.
  
 It has also been noted that some sites have added local entries in the
 DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) involving these locally added ingredients.
 If the locally added ingredients have been overwritten, these interactions
 will check for ingredients other than those indicated by the name of the
 interaction.
  
 This patch performs six functions.
  
 1.  It creates a new style cross-reference on the NAME field (#.01) and the
     PRIMARY INGREDIENT field (#2) of the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416). 
     This new cross-reference replaces the old "P" cross-reference on the
     NAME field (#.01). The "P" cross reference was not working properly
     and included entries that should not have been referenced. This
     corrects the Patient Safety Issue PSI-05-008.
  
 2.  Any entries in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416) with an internal
     entry number (IEN) greater than that of the last nationally entered
     ingredient will be deleted. These would be locally entered ingredients
     that would eventually be overwritten with national ingredients released
     with NDF Data Updates.
  
 3.  Any entries in the DRUG INTERACTIONS file (#56) which have ingredients
     pointing to these deleted locally entered ingredients will be deleted.
  
 4.  Any entries in the DRUG INTERACTIONS file (#56) which point to ingredients
     other than those indicated by the name will be deleted. These would 
     be interactions created with a locally entered ingredient that was
     subsequently overwritten by a national ingredient.
  
 5.  A mail message with the subject INGREDIENTS AND INTERACTIONS DELETED
     will be sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the mail group NDF DATA,
     holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the
     patch.  This message lists deleted ingredients, interactions deleted
     because they pointed to deleted ingredients, and interactions which
     pointed to ingredients other than those indicated in the name.  In
     the last case, both the name (containing the original ingredients)
     and the current ingredients are displayed.
  
 6.  The GMR ALLERGY field (#1) and the DRUG INGREDIENT field (#.01)
     of the DRUG INGREDIENTS multiple field (#2) in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file
     (#120.8) and the DRUG INGREDIENT field (#.01) of the DRUG INGREDIENTS
     multiple field (#2) in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) point to the
     DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416).  Any entries in these fields that
     point to ingredients that were deleted as described in item 2 above
     will be deleted.  In addition, the selection of drug ingredients in the
     PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) should allow the selection of only
     primary ingredients.  Any entries that point to ingredients that are
     not primary ingredients will be repointed to the proper primary
     ingredient.
