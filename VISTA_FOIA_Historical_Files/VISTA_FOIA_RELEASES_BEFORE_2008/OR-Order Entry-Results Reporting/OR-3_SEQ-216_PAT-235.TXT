 Patch OR*3.0*235, CPRS GUI version 25.42, resolves one patient safety 
 issue and the defects listed below.
  
 -- MEDICATION ORDERING
  
 HD 93966:  Days Supply Defaults to 0 Instead of the Value Associated with 
 the Pharmacy Patient Status
  
 PROBLEM:  OR*3.0*195 inadvertently changed the days supply value for the
 outpatient medication order dialog to default to zero instead of the value
 associated with the Pharmacy Patient Status.
  
 RESOLUTION:  OR*3.0*235 reinstates the functionality where the days supply
 value for the outpatient medication order dialog defaults to the value 
 associated with the Pharmacy Patient Status.
 -The software will no longer default to zero.
 -When the dosage for medication is entered, the Days Supply is populated.
 -When the schedule is entered, the Quantity box is populated in 
  relationship to the value in Days Supply Box.
 -As user toggles schedule (i.e. between QD, BID, TID, QID & QOD) the
  quantity box value adjusts accordingly.
  
 HD94529: Auto-calculate for Quantity Not Functioning for Outpatient 
 Medications for certain free-text schedules.
  
 Reported PROBLEM: The system is functioning correctly. In this case, the 
 issue was that the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) had an invalid 
 frequency. HOWEVER, during the research on this issue, a more serious 
 problem was discovered. That problem is explained below.
  
 RESOLUTION: If Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 is unable to calculate a 
 quantity for an order, the Quantity box in CPRS will default to 0. If the 
 Quantity is not correct, the site should verify the setup of the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file 
 (#51). For a full description on how quantity is calculated, please refer 
 to Appendix B of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 User Manual.
  
 Discovered PROBLEM: CPRS retains an old value for the Quantity box on 
 Outpatient Medication orders. If a provider switches the schedule on an 
 Outpatient order and the new schedule is not valid for calculating 
 quantity, the previous value is displayed in the Quantity box. For 
 example: Days Supply is 30, the schedule is Q8H and the calculated 
 quantity is 90. The provider switches the schedule to OIUY, an invalid 
 schedule. The Quantity box would still display 90.
  
 RESOLUTION: OR*3.0*235 modifies population of the Quantity box, such that 
 when a provider changes the schedule of the order, the Quantity box 
 display changes to match the new schedule.
  
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES RESOLVED BY THIS PATCH:
 =============================================
 HD 94904  PSI-05-045 When transferring a medication from inpatient to 
 outpatient or vice versa, the dosage field may be blank
  
 PROBLEM: An information window appears in the dialog which appears to show
 the original sig for medication being transferred. The information
 displays in such a fashion that the Name and Strength of the original sig
 shows but not the actual dosage that the patient may be taken. The next
 line in this information window is a blank line, then the actual sig
 appears on the third line.
  
 RESOLUTION:  Increase the size of the box 3 pixels larger. Then 2 lines 
 of text will be seen as in CPRS GUI v24.
  
  
 The KIDS portion of the installation will simply update the version number
 of the OR CPRS GUI CHART option to be 1.0.25.42. The .ZIP file contains an
 updated CPRS executable.
