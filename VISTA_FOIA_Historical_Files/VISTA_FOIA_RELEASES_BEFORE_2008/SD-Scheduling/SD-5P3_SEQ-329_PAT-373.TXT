 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.  Users do not have to be off the system.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still display the patch text
    only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be

 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter SD*5.3*373)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*373.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
        APPOINTMENT LIST  SDLIST     Appointment List
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
