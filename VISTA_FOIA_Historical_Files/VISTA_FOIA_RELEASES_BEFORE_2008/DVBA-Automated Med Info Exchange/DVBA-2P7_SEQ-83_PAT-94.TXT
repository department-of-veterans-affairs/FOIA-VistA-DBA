 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:

 HD0000000089574 - Updates to AMIE Joints (Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee
                   Ankle) C & P Worksheet
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE C & P worksheet for Joints (Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle),
     to change the text in several of the existing paragraphs.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA94PI which will deactivate the
         current Joints (Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle) worksheet
         (file 396.6, IEN 185), and activate the new Joints (Shoulder/
         Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle) worksheet (file 396.6, IEN 201).
     b)  Created routine DVBCWJW5 that contains the text for the new
         Joints (Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle) worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWJW4 to access the text routine in b), and
         print the new Joints (Shoulder/Elbow/Wrist/Hip/Knee/Ankle)
         worksheet.
