Subject: Y2K CHANGES FOR INCIDENT REPORTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 This patch contains routine changes that will prevent potential problems
 at year 2000, for the Incident Reporting software.
  
 The fix entails removing code that took a two digit year from user input
 and added 1900 to it.  Now, the code calls DD^%DT to convert the two digit
 year to a four digit year, as per the Y2K task force.
  
 There are no E3Rs or NOIS messages associated with this patch.
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other DHCP users will not be affected.
  
        [QAN INCIDENT MAIN MENU]        Incident Reporting Main Menu
        [QAN MANAGER MENU]              Incident Reporting Managers Menu
  
 Install Time - Less than 5 minutes.
