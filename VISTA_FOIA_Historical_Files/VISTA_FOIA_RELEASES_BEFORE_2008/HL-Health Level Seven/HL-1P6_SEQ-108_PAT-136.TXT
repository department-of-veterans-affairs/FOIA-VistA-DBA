Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*134  <<= must be installed BEFORE `HL*1.6*136'

Subject: HLO PURGE SETTINGS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem of unusually high CPU utilization that some
 sites experienced after installing patch HL*1.6*134.  Patch HL*1.6*136 should
 be installed immediately after installing HL*1.6*134.
 
 This patch changes the HLO purge process to stop multiple instances
 of the purge process from running continuously.  Instead, only one purge
 process will be started every 20 minutes, and it will terminate
 once there are no more HLO records to purge.
  
 Also, on production systems the HLO DAILY STARTUP option is scheduled by the
 post-install routine to run daily.  If this option is not scheduled to run
 daily after installing this patch, then please do so manually. It can run
 at any time.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  Use the STOP HLO action of the HLO System Monitor option to
        temporarily stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several
        minutes to insure that all HLO processes have terminated.
  
        NOTE: There is a pre-install routine that will abort the installation
              if any HLO process is still running.  If the installation
              is aborted, verify that HLO is stopped, and restart the
              installation.
    
    3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    4.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
        The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
        the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
  
        When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
        patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
        and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*136>
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
        
  
      A pre-install routine will verify that all HLO processes have been
      stopped before the installation will complete.
  
      A post-install routine will automatically change the settings to the 
      PURGE OLD MESSAGES entry in the HLO Process Registry file.  It changes
      the minimum number of those processes running at one time to 0 and 
      the maximum number to 1.
 
      On production systems, the post-install routine will also schedule
      the HLO DAILY STARTUP option to run daily.
   
    5. Use the START HLO action of the HLO System Monitor option to 
       resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
       This step is optional in test systems.
