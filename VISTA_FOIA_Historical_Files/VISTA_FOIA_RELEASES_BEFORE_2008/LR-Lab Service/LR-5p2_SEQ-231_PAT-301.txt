Subject: LAB CHANGES FOR VBECS RELEASE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released in support of the VBECS (Vista Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software) Blood Bank Modernization Project.  In 
 the future, data will be transitioned from the existing M database to a 
 Microsoft SQL database.  This patch will begin the Lab packages 
 transition to the new database.
  
  
  Routine     Area Affected
  
  LR7OR1      This routine provides an API for the retrieval of Lab
              results for a patient.  All references to the BB subscript
              (BLOOD BANK subfile #63.01) of the LAB DATA file (#63)
              have been removed.
  
  LRDPA1      The retrieval of ABO data for a patient has been
              transitioned from direct global reads to the ABO^VBECA1
              API (DBIA 3181-B).
              The retrieval of RH factor data for a patient has been
              transitioned from direct global reads to the RH^VBECA1
              API. (DBIA 3181-C)
  
  LRDPA2      The retrieval of Blood Bank Comments for a patient has
              been transitioned from direct global reads to the
              BBCMT^VBECA1 API (DBIA 3181-H).
              The retrieval of Antibodies Identified for a patient has
              been transitioned from direct global reads to the
              ABID^VBECA1 API (DBIA 3181-D).
              The retrieval of Transfusion Reactions for a patient has
              been transitioned from direct global reads to the
              TRRX^VBECA1 API (DBIA 3181-G).
  
  
  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*301 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*301 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
  RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*301 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
  
   NOTE: This KIDS install does not place any options out of service
         during the install and no user options are affected.
         If KIDS prompts:
   
         "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
          Install? YES// NO"
         "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO"
         "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
         Protocols? YES// NO"
  
         The site should answer "NO" to all three questions.
             Note: You may not receive all three prompts at your site.  
   
         1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
            This option will load the KIDS package in this message onto
            your system.
         2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they
            should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
         3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on
            your system. You now need to use KIDS to install the
            Transport global.
            On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
            following options:
                Print Transport Global
                Compare Transport Global to Current System
                Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                Backup a Transport Global
         4. Users may remain on the system.
         5. No options need to be placed out of service.
         6. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off peak
            hours and less the 5 minutes during peak hours.
         7. Installation of this patch requires no additional memory
            space.
         8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the
            option 'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'LR*5.2*301'
            and proceed with the install.
         9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should
            be returned to the mapped set once the installation has run
            to completion.
