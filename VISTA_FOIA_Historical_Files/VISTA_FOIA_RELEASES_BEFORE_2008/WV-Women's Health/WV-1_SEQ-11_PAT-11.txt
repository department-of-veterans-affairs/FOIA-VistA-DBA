Description: 
============

 Associated NOIS: None
 Associated E3Rs: None
  
 The Military Sexual Trauma (MST) Software Directive 99-039, dated August
 27, 1999 mandates the screening, tracking and documentation of MST for ALL
 enrolled veterans (men and women) who utilize VHA. This patch will aid
 Women's Health (WH) package users to meet the directive.
  
 This patch makes the following enhancements:
  
 1) Adds the MST Status Add/Edit [DGMST ENTER NEW MST] option to the
    Patient Management menu. This is the same option used by the MST module
    of the Registration package. This option allows the WH user to enter
    (MST) data directly into the MST module from a WH menu. Permission to
    add this Registration package option to the WH menu is granted in
    IA #3108.
  
    The option is added to the menu by the post-installation routine.
  
  Code Changes:
  =============
  Routine: WV11PST
  
 2) Adds a new option, List Sexual Trauma Data [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA LIST], to
    the Management Reports menu. This option displays a list of WH
    patients, their WH Sexual Trauma value, and MST module value.
  
    The option is added to the menu by the post-installation routine.
  
  Code Changes:
  =============
  Routine: WV11PST, WVMSTL, WVMSTL1
  
 3) Adds a new option, Add Sexual Trauma Data to MST Module [WV ADD TO
    MST], to the File Maintenance menu. This option will copy sexual trauma
    data from the WH package to the MST module. The option will display a
    list of patients whose WH data was successfully added to the MST
    module. Also, it will display a list of WH patients whose data could
    not be added to the MST module.
  
    The option is added to the menu by the post-installation routine.
  
  Code Changes:
  =============
  Routine: WV11PST, WVMST, WVMST1
  
 4) Adds "(WH only)" to the menu text for the [WV SEXUAL TRAUMA SUMMARY]
    option. After the patch, the menu text will be "Sexual Trauma Summary
    Report (WH only)". Otherwise, the option remains unchanged.
