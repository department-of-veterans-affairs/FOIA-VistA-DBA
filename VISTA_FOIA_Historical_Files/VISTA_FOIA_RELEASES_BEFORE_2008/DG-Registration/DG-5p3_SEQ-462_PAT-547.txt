Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*244  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*547'

Subject: PATIENT NAME VARIABLE CLEANUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a name component array left defined by the Patient
 Name Standardization functionality implemented with patch DG*5.3*244.  
 This variable left open the possibility for the incorrect name component
 values to be stored during the MPI patient demographic editing
 functionality implemented with patch MPIF*1.0*28.
  
 NOIS Addressed:
 ==============
 AMA-0703-70985     Name from previous patient since patch 28 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the option DG LOAD PATIENT DATA and editing a second patient's
 name immediately after editing the first patient, the name component
 values from the first patient would carry over into the second patient
 during the name component editing functionality implemented with MPI patch
 MPIF*1.0*28.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The name component array, DG20NAME, will be killed upon completion of the
 name editing functionality in the DG LOAD PATIENT DATA option.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Dublin, GA
 Amarillo, TX
