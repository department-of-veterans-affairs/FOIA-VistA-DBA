Subject: CBO DATA EXTRACT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem with the VistA IB/AR (Integrated Billing/
 Accounts Receivable) Data Extract for CBO.  Only bills that have been
 previously authorized should be included with the extract.  However,
 during the internal testing of PRCA*4.5*228, VistA IB/AR Data Extract
 Phase II, Part 1, it was discovered that bills which were cancelled but
 not authorized were also being included.  This will no longer happen after
 this fix.
  
 If an authorized bill is later cancelled, then this bill will still get 
 extracted.  No change has been made to this functionality.
  
 This patch also provides a new IB (Integrated Billing) API (Application 
 Program Interface) to extract IB and MRA (Medicare Remittance Advice)
 information.
  
 The existing VistA IB/AR Data Extract for CBO will be updated to use this
 new API.
