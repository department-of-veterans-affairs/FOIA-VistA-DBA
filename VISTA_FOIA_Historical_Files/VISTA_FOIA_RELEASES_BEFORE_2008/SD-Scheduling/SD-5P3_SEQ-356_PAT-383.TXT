Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*76   <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*383'

Subject: CORRECTION OF CLINIC AVAILABILITY DISPLAY.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem in the Display Clinic Availability option. 
 If this option is chosen for dates prior to the actual start date of the 
 clinic or for dates where there is no current availability, it will 
 incorrectly create availability for those dates. This allows the
 scheduling of patients on dates when the clinic is not open.
  
 Please note that there are limitations to this fix. It will only prevent 
 the creation of invalid availability dates when the Display Clinic 
 Availability option is run after the patch is installed. False 
 availability may exist for clinics with future start dates if the Display 
 Clinic Availability option was run and a date earlier than the clinic's
 start date was selected for the date range. An automated clean up of the
 bad availability dates is not possible because the system does not
 permanently store a true clinic start date.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 HD63992 - Clinic not jumping to next available.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user runs the Display Clinic Availability option for a date prior to 
 the start date of a clinic or for a date where there is no availability
 and the current availability pattern is set to continue indefinitely,
 availability will be created for that date using the existing pattern.
 Once these days have availability, the users and the system (auto re-book)
 can schedule appointments for these dates even though the clinic is not
 open.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. Take out the code that creates availability via this report.
 Availability should be created using the "SET UP A CLINIC" option.
