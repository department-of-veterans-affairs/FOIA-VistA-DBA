Subject: Routing Mailman Acks

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 This patch 
  
 1. Resolves an issue with how to address responses to messages
 arriving over a Mailman-type Logical Link. 
  
 If ROUTING LOGIC is defined, the response will be dynamically addressed
 using the SOURCE DOMAIN provided by querying Mailman. In some cases this
 could result in a response being returned over a logical link that is
 different from the one the message arrived on. Specifically, the source
 domain will resolve to one of the VA-namespaced logical links exported
 with HL*1.6*39. If this is the case, it is important to insure that the
 links on both the sending and receiving systems are properly configured
 and enabled.
  
 If there is no routing logic defined on the subscriber protocol, Vista HL7
 will assume that the link defined on the subscriber protocol is the
 correct return path and Mailman will not be queried.
  
 2. Fixes a corrupted node found on the logical link, LR NCH-L which
 prevented patch HL*1.6*57 from converting this link.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  
  
   2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
  
       the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from 
       the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3.  Shutdown all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers, and
       the Link Manager. Use the options:
  
         Filer and Link Management Options -> 
             SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
             LM     TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop
  
   4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
  
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
       options: 
  
          2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
          3 Print Transport Global 
          4 Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          5 Backup a Transport Global 
          6 Install Package(s) 
              INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*60
                            =========
  
         Answer 'YES' to 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees upon Completion
         of Install?'.
  
         Answer 'NO' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?'.
   
         Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols?'.  
  
   6.  Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers. Use the 
  
         Filer and Link Management Options ->
             RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
         (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need to
         be restarted manually)
    
       For DSM sites ONLY, if you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
       for this installation, you may now enable it.
  
   7.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
  
   8.  Start Link Manager using the option: "TCP/IP
         Link Manager Start/Stop."
