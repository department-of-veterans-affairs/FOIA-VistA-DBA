Subject: Error when printing EF

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 
 AICS prints specific lists of patient or clinic information in a 
 specific space on an Encounter Form.  When space is unavailable on the
 Encounter Form, AICS will print the entire list on a separate Encounter Form 
 Additional Data sheet.  This primarily happens with lists of a patients active
 problems but can occur in other lists such as a list of practitioners.  The 
 information about these lists is stored in the Forms Tracking file (357.96).
 
                   
 This patch fixes a problem that occurs when an overflow sheet is printed 
 for an Encounter Form that is not tracked in Forms Tracking.  For example, 
 when printing Sample Forms [IBDF PRINT SAMPLE ALL CLINICS], information about 
 a specific patient is printed on the Encounter Form but the forms themselves 
 are not tracked in Forms Tracking.  The logic to print these lists and to store
 this information was created prior to the ability to print Sample Forms.
 The need to modify this logic was not realized until the following
 NOIS were entered, consequently the error null subscript occurs.
 
                     
 IBD*3.0*39 resolves this problem, and addresses the
 following NOIS(s):
