Associated patches: (v)HDI*1*2     <<= must be installed BEFORE `HDI*1*6'

Subject: NEW API(S) AND BULLETIN CHECKS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 It was found that the status messages generated during VUID 
 initialization did not always make it to the HDI Central Server.  The 
 local status files were being updated appropriately.  This resulted in 
 inconsistent statuses.  Code was added to routines HDISVM00 and HDISVM02 
 to call a new API $$ERR2XTMP^HDISVU01 which stores the incurred error 
 message in the ^XTMP global.  Another API was created to add a Domain and 
 its related files to the HDIS DOMAIN File.
  
 The above changes are for HDI internal use only, and have no visual 
 effects at local sites.
  
  
  API for Insuring Test Account Integrity 
  ----------------------------------------
  The following API is distributed by this patch.  The API will be
  used by the HSITES and are documented under DBIA 4856.
  
    $$TESTACT^HDISVCUT()
    
 Sets the HDIS SYSTEM file fields to reflect a mirrored test account 
 and remove any multiple entries.

         DESCRIPTION:                        TYPE: Routine
    API will be used by HSITES as part of their software to insure that 
    mirrored test accounts are setup properly.  
  
      ROUTINE: HDISVCUT
    COMPONENT:  TESTACT
                This API will be used by HSITES. HSITES has a software tool
                which sites use to insure a test account has been setup
                properly.  This API will change the mirrored production
                account data to function properly in the test site
                environment.  It will update the Domain/IP Address and the 
                System Type (Production or Test) in the HDIS System file
                (#7118.21).  
  
 The following API is distributed by this patch.  The API will be used 
 internally by HDI routines to add entries in the HDIS DOMAIN (#7115.1) 
 file.
  
   $$UPDTDOM^HDISVCUT(HDDOM,.HDISDFFS)
       HDDOM - Domain Name  (i.e. ORDERS)
       HDISDFFS - An array equal to the files included in the Domain
                     (i.e. HDISDFFS(100.01)="")
