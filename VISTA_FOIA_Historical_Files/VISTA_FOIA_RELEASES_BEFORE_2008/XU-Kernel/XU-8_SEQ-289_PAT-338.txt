    the affected routine.
  
 3. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 4. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
    option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
 5. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.

                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
