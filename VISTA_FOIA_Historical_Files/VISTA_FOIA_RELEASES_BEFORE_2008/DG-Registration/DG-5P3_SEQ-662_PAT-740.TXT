Subject: Fix IN1 Segment Builder

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Issue
 -----
 A patch released 10/20/05, IB*2.0*317 SEQ #283 Claims Tracking
 Enhancement, added a new data value, -1, to be returned from the 
 INSUR^IBBFAPI Application Programmer Interface (API) if an error condition
 occurred or there was bad data. Because the HL7 full data transmission Z07
 builder that creates an insurance (IN1) segment was not accordingly
 updated to accept the new data value, in the rare instance when the
 INSUR^IBBFAPI API returned a -1, an IN1 segment would not be created.
 As a result, when the batch Z07 message was sent to the Health Eligibility
 Center (HEC), all of the records with missing IN1 segments were rejected
 because HEC interpreted these as incomplete or bad transmissions.
  
  
 Solution
 --------
 If the data value returned from the INSUR^IBBFAPI API is not equal to 1,
 then build an IN1 segment.

       ================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==================
  
 If possible, sites should install this patch during off hours in order to
 minimize the impact to HL7 transmissions. It is recommended that the
 following menu option (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible conflicts
 while running the KIDS Install.
  
   IVM BACKGROUND JOB  [IVM BACKGROUND JOB]
  
 You may wish to stop the HL7 filers prior to the install to prevent
 possible 'No Source Errors' from occurring. No transmissions will be lost
 if the filers are stopped first; they will be picked up once the filers
 are restarted.
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes.
