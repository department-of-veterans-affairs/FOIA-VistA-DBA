Subject: CORRECTIONS TO APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 2 issues with Appointment Management.  First, if a 
 user selects the action 'AL' Appointment Lists and then sub-action 'TA'  
 Total Appointment Profile, a list of all appointments for the selected 
 clinic will be displayed.  However, if the user selects sub-action 'CI'  
 Checked In, they always get the message:  "No appointments meet criteria".  
 Second, if a user selects the action 'NS' No-Show for an inpatient 
 appointment, they will get a message indicating inpatient appointments 
 cannot have a status of no-show and the appointment is automatically 
 canceled.  It is true that the inpatient appointment cannot have a status of 
 No Show, however, the appointment should not be canceled.  If the user then 
 selects action 'EP' Expand Entry, the user who made the appointment no longer
 is displayed but it should be.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD96992   Appointment management list of appointments
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If a user selects the action 'AL'  Appointment Lists and then 
     sub-action 'TA' Total Appointment Profile, a list of all appointments
     for the selected clinic will be displayed.  However, if the user then
     selects sub-action 'CI' Checked In, they always get the message:  
     "No appointments meet criteria".
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     During assessment of this issue, it was discovered that an appointment
     will never have a status of just 'Checked In'.  When appointments are
     checked in, they always have a status of 'Act Req/Checked In'.  
     Routine SDAM1, which builds the list of appointments to display for
     this option, will be modified to check for appointments with the
     status of 'Act Req/Checked In' when sub-action 'CI' Checked In is
     selected.
  
 2)  HD100280  Data Entry Clerk Disappearing from appointment data
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user is in Appointment Management and selects action 'NS'
     No-Show and then selects action 'EP' Expand Entry the user who
     made the appointment no longer displays.  This problem only occurs 
     with inpatient appointments.  Secondly, when a user does attempt to 
     No-Show an inpatient appointment, they are not allowed to, which is 
     correct.  However, the appointment is then automatically cancelled, 
     which is not correct.  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDN2 has been modified so that the user who made the 
     appointment will be displayed and when a user attempts to No Show
     an appointment, the message "Inpatient Appointments cannot reflect no-
     show status!" will still display, but the logic to automatically
     cancel the appointment has been removed.
