If the value of the Data Qualifier shall be passed to PCE as the VALUE,

this field should be set to one.  Doing so will prevent the data in the

This file contains a description of all of the interfaces with other packages.

The form will invoke the proper interface routines by doing a lookup on
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",3,0)
this file and then calling the routine by indirection. The
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",4,0)
Data will be exchanged between the encounter form utilities and other
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",5,0)
packages by putting the data in at @IBARY. Interfaces that pass a single
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",6,0)
value or record will will reference data as in: S DATA=@IBARY. Interfaces
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",7,0)
that pass lists of records or values will reference the data as in:

Note that multiple entries in this file can have the same entry points

into routines. This is for efficiency purposes. For example, patient name,
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",12,0)
DOB and sex are all located on the same node of the Patient file. Each of
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",13,0)
these items of data can have its own entry in the Package Interface file,
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",14,0)
but by using the same entry point there is a savings because all of the
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",15,0)
data on that node can be obtained at once. The routine that invokes the
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",16,0)
entry points keeps track of those already invoked so that they are not
"^DIC",357.6,357.6,"%D",17,0)
