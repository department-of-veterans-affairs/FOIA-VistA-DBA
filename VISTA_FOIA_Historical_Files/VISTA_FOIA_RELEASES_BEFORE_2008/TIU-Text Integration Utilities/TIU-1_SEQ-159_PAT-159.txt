Subject: WRIISC Template and Objects

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 In May 2001, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi approved two 
 new War-Related Illness and Injury Study Centers - WRIISC (pronounced 
 "risk").  These new centers are located at the Washington, DC, and East 
 Orange, NJ, VA Medical Centers (VAMC).  Veterans may be referred by their 
 VA physician to a WRIISC center for clinical evaluation.
 
 Prior to accepting referrals to the WRIISC evaluation program, primary care 
 physicians need to complete the electronic WRIISC CPRS template.  Paper 
 referrals are problematic as they are frequently lost or illegible.  This 
 electronic point and click CPRS template will make it easier for the 
 referring physician.  Additionally, the WRIISC referral template will become
 a permanent part of the CPRS medical record.
 
 The WRIISC program is asking VISN directors and registry coordinators to 
 assist with getting this template activated within their local CPRS 
 systems.  This WRIISC template will need to be imported onto local CPRS 
 systems throughout the national VAMC system.
  
 This patch provides a CPRS template to be used in conjunction with a new 
 PROGRESS NOTE title along with the necessary TIU Objects needed for all 
 referrals to the War Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC).  The 
 use of this template for all submissions to the WRIISC is mandatory.
 
 Completed referral notes should be printed and faxed to the following:
 
      Sr. Environmental Health Coordinator
      Environmental Agents Service (131)
      Department of Veterans Affairs
      810 Vermont Avenue, NW
      Washington, DC 20420
 
      Phone:  (202) 273-8463
      FAX:    (202) 273-9080
 
 An informational letter, WRIISCMEMO.PDF, is also available for more 
 information and can be downloaded along with the template via the FTP sites 
 detailed below.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 
   Pre-Install Instructions
 
     Downloading and Importing the Template
 
     Local IRM personnel and Clinical Application Coordinators will need to
     import the .TXML file into their respective CPRS systems and be 
     authorized to add new template fields.
 
     1.  Download the template (WRIISCASSESSMENT.TXML) via FTP in ASCII mode
         to your local system.
     2.  Import the template into CPRS and copy it to the DOCUMENT TITLES 
         folder.
     3.  (OPTIONAL)  Create a new DOCUMENT CLASS entry under PROGRESS NOTES
         where the new note title, WRIISC ASSESSMENT NOTE, will be installed
         by this patch.  Alternatively, a pre-existing DOCUMENT CLASS within 
         PROGRESS NOTES may be used.
 
   Install Instructions
 
     This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it 
     should be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the 
     users.  Installation of this patch should take less than 5 minutes.
 
         **  User input is required for this installation **
         **  Do NOT queue or print the installation of this patch  **
 
     Due to inconsistencies in the local naming conventions throughout VAMCs
     for various lab tests, you will be prompted with a generic lab test
     name so that you may map your site's locally name spaced corresponding
     lab test -- See Install Step 12 for the prompt.  These lab tests are
     used with the TIU Objects installed with this patch.  
 
     Your site's LAB ADPAC should be consulted to determine which lab tests 
     are to be mapped to the LAB TIU OBJECTs that will be created during 
     the installation of this patch.
 
     4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.
     5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
         select the Installation Menu.
     6.  From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following
         options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*159):
           a.  Backup a Transport Global
           b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
     7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and enter TIU*1.0*159.
     8.  When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO.
     9.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols?  YES//', respond YES, and DISABLE the TIU* Options
         and Protocols.
    10.  When prompted, 'DEVICE:HOME//', accept the default value of HOME.
    11.  When prompted, 'Select the DOCUMENT CLASS where the new title will
         be installed: ', respond with the name of the DOCUMENT CLASS where
         the new TIU PROGRESS NOTE title WRIISC ASSESSMENT NOTE will be 
         installed.  The title MUST be installed under PROGRESS NOTES.
    12.  When prompted, 'Enter your site's local lab name for <LAB TEST 
         NAME>:  ', respond with your sites corresponding local test name.
         If you exit the installation by entering a '^' for a local lab 
         name, you may re-initialize the note title and object creation by
         entering EN^TIUWRII1 from the programmer prompt.  EN^TIUWRII1 may 
         also be used if you wish to change a lab test that was previously 
         selected; EN^TIUWRII1 may be ran as many times as needed and will
         not cause duplicate entries for the note title or objects.
 
   Post-Install Instructions
 
    13.  In CPRS GUI, link the imported template, WRIISCASSESSMENT.TXML, with 
         the WRIISC ASSESSMENT NOTE.
    14.  In CPRS GUI, verify the functionality of the newly created WRIISC 
         ASSESSMENT NOTE title and template and make any corrections to any 
         data objects not found.
