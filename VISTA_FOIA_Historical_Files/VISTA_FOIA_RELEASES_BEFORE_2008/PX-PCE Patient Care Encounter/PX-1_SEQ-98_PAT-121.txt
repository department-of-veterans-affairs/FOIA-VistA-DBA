 **************************************************************************
 *               THIS BUILD IS PART OF THE CSV PROJECT AND                *
 *          MUST BE INSTALLED AT ALL SITES BY SEPTEMBER 30, 2003          *

 This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
 Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
 routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
 the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
 Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
 implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
 and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
 This patch is contained in the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS):
   CSV MS 1.0
  
 Installing the CSV MS 1.0 build provides all of the updates
 listed below.  Sites will use the KIDS to
 ensure the proper order of installation for the VISTA Packages
 in the Management Systems Product Line.

 I. BACKGROUND
    ============
 
 Gail Graham, Director of Information Assurance, requested modifications
 to the VHA Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) Patient
 Information Management System (PIMS) package that allows the use of
 multiple versions of the code sets employed in financial transactions.
 This includes multiple versions of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
 diagnostic related grouping software, also known as the "VHA Grouper".
 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulates that
 diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes
 that were applicable at the time the service was provided.  This initative
 is commonly referred to as the Code Set Versioning (CSV) project.  For this
 project, four code sets required by HIPAA legislation are date sensitive
 and needed modification. These include:
   * International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modifications
    (ICD-9-CM),
   * Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) Codes, which is part of the ICD-9
    code set,
   * Clinical Procedure Terminology-4 (CPT-4), and
   * Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) Level II Codes.
 
 Additional code sets may be determined by the Department of Health and 
 Human Services for future inclusion.
 
 
 This patch addresses the changes done within the Patient Care Encounter
 package in compliance to the specifications of CSV.  Modifications were done
 within the Patient Care Encounter application to assure validity of CPT codes,
 and CPT modifiers, and ICD diagnosis and CPT procedure codes, by utilizing an
 API that return codes for a given encounter date.
 
 The changes affects to the following options:
      PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY        PCE Encounter Data Entry
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER       PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE    PCE Encounter Data Entry and Delete
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE   PCE Encounter Data Entry without Delete
      PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER            PCE Encounter Viewer
      PX PCE CLINICIAN MENU            PCE Clinician Menu
      PX PCE COORDINATOR MENU          PCE Coordinator Menu
      PXQ PCE/SD DEBUGGING UTILITIES   PCE/SD Debugging Utilities
      
 The changes affects to the following protocols:
      PXCE ADD/EDIT                    Update Encounter 
      PXCE ADD/EDIT DISPLAY BRIEF      Display Brief 
      PXCE ADD/EDIT DISPLAY DETAIL     Display Detail
      PXCE ADD/EDIT INTERVIEW                 Check Out Interview
      PXCE CPT ADD                     CPT (Procedure)
      PXCE EDIT V-FILE                Edit an Item
      PXCE NEW ENCOUNTER               Add Standalone Enc.
      PXCE POV ADD                     Diagnosis (ICD-9)
