Subject: Patient Services Construct for Java

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
  Patient Service Construct is a Veterans Health Information Systems and 
  Technology Architecture (VistA) re-engineering project based on the Java 
  technologies.  Patient Service is a composite business service that will 
  provide a broad range of high-level patient administrative data.  The 
  data will be based on access to the individual business services such as
  Patient Demographics, Eligibility/Enrollment, and Patient Identification,
  which serve as authoritative sources for that data.   For those
  applications that have been re-engineered, all needs to retrieve patient
  administrative data through a common business service will be met.  The
  Patient Service Construct functionality provided in this patch will be 
  invisible to existing M VistA applications.  It is being released to 
  support upcoming HealtheVet applications such as Blind Rehab, Veterans 
  Personal Finance System (VPFS) and Replacement Scheduling Application 
  (RSA). 
  
  NEW OPTION:
  ----------
  
  DGRR PATIENT SERVICE QUERY, Patient Service Query, is a new Broker  
  (Client/Server) type option added by this patch to provide access for 
  the Patient Service Construct users.
  
  REMOTE PROCEDURE CALLS:
  ----------------------
  DGRR GET PATIENT SERVICES DATA -  This RPC will return an XML via 
  VistaLink  containing Patient Service Demographic information for any

  parameters to the RPC are:
  
       (Rq) Required parameter  (Op) Optional parameter
   
       (Rq) PARAMS("PatientId_Type")      = the three letters "DFN" or

       (Rq) PARAMS("PatientId")           = the actual value of the 
                                            patient DFN or ICN (ICN

   NOTE:  ICN is the preferred value for the PatientId_Type and Patient_Id 
          parameters.  Retrieval of patient demographic data by DFN will be
          supported until all records have been enumerated.
  
  Entry point for this RPC is PATIENT^DGRRPSGT.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
  will take less than 5 minutes.  These installation instructions apply 
  to the M portion of the application.
                  
                                  **Warning** 
  When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
  is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question. If you choose to have KIDs rebuild 
  the menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may
  take several hours.
  
  Note: Most sites have a nightly batch job that rebuilds the menus so if
  you queued the installations ensure that it will complete prior to the 
  batch job.  Or, if you are installing several builds, wait until the last
  one to use the KIDs rebuild functionality.
  
                                      ****
  
  1.  Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION Menu, and 
      enter: DG_53_P557.KID.
  
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*557): 
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      DG*5.3*557.
  
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES??//',respond NO.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
  7.  Assign the DGRR PATIENT SERVICE QUERY option to the appropriate 
      users as needed.
