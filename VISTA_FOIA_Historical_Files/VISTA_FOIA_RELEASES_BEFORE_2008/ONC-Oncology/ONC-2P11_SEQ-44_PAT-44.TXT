 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator.
  
 This patch contains the following problem resolutions and modifications.
 
  1) SITE-GP (#165.5,.01) BREAKOUTS
 
     The following modifications have been made to SITE-GP values:
 
     LUNG
     a) The SITE-GP LUNG has been renamed LUNG NOS.
     b) A new SITE-GP called LUNG SMALL CELL has been created.
     c) For all lung cases, if the HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) value is one of the
        following values, the SITE-GP will be changed from LUNG NOS to LUNG
        SMALL CELL:
 
        8041/2  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU
        8041/3  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA, NOS
        8042/2  OAT CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU
        8042/3  OAT CELL CARCINOMA
        8043/2  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU, FUSIFORM CELL
        8043/3  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA, FUSIFORM CELL
        8044/2  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU, INTERMED CELL
        8044/3  SMALL CELL CARCINOMA, INTERMEDIATE CELL
        8045/2  COMBINED SMALL CELL CARCINOMA IN SITU
        8045/3  COMBINED SMALL CELL CARCINOMA
        8246/2  NEUROENDOCRINE CARCINOMA IN SITU
        8246/3  NEUROENDOCRINE CARCINOMA  
 
     MELANOMA
     For all melanoma cases, the SITE-GP will be changed to MELANOMA.
 
     RECTUM/ANUS
     a) The SITE-GP RECTUM/ANUS has been renamed RECTUM.
     b) A new SITE-GP called ANUS has been created.
     c) If the PRIMARY SITE CODE value is one of the following values, the
        SITE-GP will be changed from RECTUM to ANUS:
 
        C21.0 ANUS NOS
        C21.1 ANAL CANAL
        C21.2 CLOACOGENIC ZONE
        C21.8 RECTUM/ANUS/CANAL OVERLAP
 
  2) HISTO-MORPHOLOGY (#165.5,27)
 
     The computed field HISTO-MORPHOLOGY was using HISTOLOGY ICD-O-2
     (#165.5,22) values to compute the HISTO-MORPHOLOGY value.  This was
     incorrect.  The COMPUTED-FIELD EXPRESSION has been changed to use
     HISTOLOGY ICD-O-3 (#165.5,22.3) values.
 
  3) OPTIONS PLACED "OUT OF ORDER"
 
     The following options have been placed "Out of Order".  If no interest is
     expressed in retaining them, they will be deleted in a future patch.
 
     In the FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU] menu:
 
     SR  Follow-up Status Report by Patient (132c) [ONCO FOLLOWUP-STATUS REPORT]
              **> Out of order:  Marked for deletion
 
    In the UTL *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU] menu:
 
    PI   Patient/Primary Inquiry [ONCO UTIL-PATIENT INQUIRY]
              **> Out of order:  Marked for deletion
 
    RD   Print Oncology Patient Record [ONCO UTIL-RECORD DUMP]
              **> Out of order:  Marked for deletion
 
  4) BASAL CELL INDICATOR (160.1,2)
 
     The ONCOLOGY site parameter BASAL CELL INDICATOR has been removed.
     Laboratory casefinding has been modified to always exclude basal cell
     neoplasms.
 
  5) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
      NC Print Abstract NOT Complete List [ONCO ABSTRACT-NOT COMPLETE]
 
     CLASS OF CASE (#165.5,.03) has been added to the PRIMARY ABSTRACT
     NOT-COMPLETE Report.
 
  6) New field TNM BEST (#165.5,40.1)
     Staging field name changes
 
     A new computed field, TNM BEST, has been created.  This field will display
     the "best" TNM string as determined by the clinical/pathologic hierarchy
     rules.
 
     Also, the following field names have been changed:
 
     Old name: CLINICAL TNM (#165.5,37)
     New name: TNM CLINICAL
 
     Old name: PATHOLOGIC TNM (#165.5,89.1)
     New name: TNM PATHOLOGIC
 
     Old name: CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (#165.5,38)
     New name: STAGE GROUP CLINICAL
 
     Old name: PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP (#165.5,88)
     New name: STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC
 
     Old name: AJCC STAGE (#165.5,40)
     New name: STAGE GROUP BEST
 
  7) NO STAGING FOR PANCREAS, ISLETS (C25.4)
 
     No TNM coding/staging is available for the PRIMARY SITE PANCREAS, ISLETS
     (C25.4).  These cases will be stuffed with the appropriate "no staging"
     values.
 
  8) RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE (#165.5,51.3)
 
     If SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) (#165.5,58.6) and SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F)
     (#165.5,58.7) had code values of 98 (Hematopoietic/reticuloendothelial,
     immuno/myeloproliferative), the RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE value was
     stuffed incorrectly.  It should be stuffed with 0 (No rad and/or surgery).
     This has been fixed.  Any old cases which satisfy this new stuffing
     criterion will be stuffed with 0.
 
  9) LATERALITY (#165.5,28)
     MENINGES, CEREBRAL C70.0
 
     MENINGES, CEREBRAL (C70.0) became a "Paired Organ Site" with the
     implementation of FORDS.
 
     2004+ cases for this site will now be prompted for LATERALITY.  Pre-2004
     cases will continue to have their LATERALITY value stuffed with 0 (Not a
     paired site).
 
 10) NAACCR EXTRACT CHANGES
 
     a) The DEFAULT values for the following NAACCR data items have been changed
     to BLANK.  These items should only be reported for pre-2003 cases.  2003+
     cases should report a value of BLANK for these items.
 
     RX Hosp--Scope Reg 98-02  [747]  480-480
     RX Summ--Reg LN Examined  [1296] 863-864
     RX Summ--Scope Reg 98-02  [1647] 941-941
     RX Summ--Surg Oth 98-02   [1648] 942-942
 
     b) ICD-O-2 Conversion Flag [1980] 1147-1147
 
     The ICD-O-2 Conversion Flag extract logic has been changed as follows:
     For pre-2001 cases, ICD-O-2 CONVERSION FLAG = 4.
     For 2001+ cases, ICD-O-2 CONVERSION FLAG = BLANK.
 
     NOTE: These changes were not made to the VACCR EXTRACT V10.1 extract.
     The VACCR EXTRACT V10.1 was left as is as per R. Dorn's request.
 
 11) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
      EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-EXTENDED 80]
      QA Print Abstract QA (80c) [ONCO ABSTRACT QA]
 
     a) The EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c) report has been modified and
        redesigned.
 
     b) A new option, QA Print Abstract QA (80c), has been added.  This
        option replaces the BA Print Abstract-Brief (80c) option.
 
 12) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
      RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-RECURRENCE]
      RADIATION SEQUENCE (#165.51,1)
 
     RADIATION SEQUENCE has been removed from the RF Recurrence/Sub Tx
     Follow-up dialog.
 
 13) UTL    *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]
      CT Create ACOS Data Download [ONCO #SITE-CREATE ACOS DISK]
 
     The default value for "Accession Year" was the current year.  This was
     incorrect.  The default value has been removed.
 
 14) SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ... [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]
      NP Oncology Patient List-NO Primaries/Suspense [ONCO SUSPENSE-NOPRIMARY]
 
     The MENU TEXT for the above option has been changed:
 
     Old MENU TEXT: NP Oncology Patient List-NO Primaries/Suspense
     New MENU TEXT: NP Patients in Suspense with no primaries
 
 15) UP-ARROW (^) OUT
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
      MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts [ONCO ABSTRACT-MULTIPLE]
     
     When displaying multiple abstracts to the screen the users were unable to
     up-arrow out and return to the menu.  This has been fixed.  When the
     users now up-arrow out, they will see the following prompt: 
 
     "Enter RETURN to go to next abstract or '^' to exit:"
 
     An up-arrow at this prompt will return the user to the menu.  Entering
     RETURN will interrupt the current abstract display and go to the next
     abstract.
  
 16) SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) (#165.5,138.4) code 9 stuffing
 
     In accordance with the FORDS "Instructions for Coding" (FORDS page 138),
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) will now be stuffed with a code 9 (Unknown/NA) in
     the following circumstances:
 
     a) For primaries of the meninges, brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and
     other parts of the central nervous system (C70.0-C70.9, C71.0-C71.9,
     C72.0-C72.9).
     
     b) For lymphomas (M-9590-9596, 9650-9719, 9727-9729) with a lymph node
     primary site (C77.0-C77.9).
 
     c) For an unknown or ill-defined primary site (C76.0-C76.8, C80.9) or for
     hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or myelo-
     proliferative disease (C42.0, C42.1, C42.3, C42.4 or M-9750, 9760-9764,
     9800-9820, 9826, 9831-9920, 9931-9964, 9980-9989).
 
 17) OROPHARYNX, POSTERIOR WALL C10.3
     TNM Edition Number [1060] 593-594
 
     Sixth Edition C10.3 cases were being assigned a "TNM Edition Number" of
     88.  This was incorrect.  The "TNM Edition Number" value should be 6.
     This has been fixed.
 
 18) SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F)        (#165.5,58.6)
     DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE (#165.5,170)
 
     DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE will no longer be stuffed with 00/00/0000
     if SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) = 00 (None; no surgery; autopsy ONLY).
 
     DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE will no longer be stuffed with 99/99/9999
     if SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) = 99 (Unknown; death certificate ONLY).
 
     This item backs out item 4 from patch ONC*2.11*43.
 
     Also, DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE has been relocated within the abstract
     input dialog.  It now appears after SURG PROC/OTHER SITE @FAC DATE.
 
 19) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...[ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
      PF Post/Edit Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-POST/EDIT]
     CANCER STATUS (#165,573,.02)
 
     When posting or editing a follow-up the registrar is prompted to update
     the CANCER STATUS for each primary for this patient.  This updating
     process is now DIVISION specific.  For multidivisional facilities the
     registrar will only be prompted to update the CANCER STATUS of primaries
     which belong to their DIVISION. For single-division facilities this change
     will be transparent.
 
 20) CODE DESCRIPTION CHANGES
 
     For the following fields the descriptions for codes 1 and 2 have been
     changed.
 
     Code   Old code description   New code description
     ----   --------------------   --------------------
      1     Positive               Abnormal
      2     Negative               Within normal limits
 
      CHEST X-RAY          (#165.5,175)
      CT SCAN              (#165.5,176)
      BRONCHOSCOPY         (#165.5,177)
      MEDIASTINOSCOPY      (#165.5,178)

      BARIUM ENEMA         (#165.5,182)
      SIGMOIDOSCOPY        (#165.5,183)
      CT OF ABDOMEN/PELVIS (#165.5,184)
      COLONOSCOPY          (#165.5,185)
 
 21) TNM edition for Lymphoma cases
 
     If the PRIMARY SITE (#165.5,20) had no AJCC staging schema and the
     histologic type was Lymphoma, the TNM edition value was being computed
     as 88 (Not applicable).  This was incorrect.  The Lymphoma staging schema
     takes precedence over the PRIMARY SITE staging schema.
 
     eg. PRIMARY SITE        = BRAIN, CEREBRUM C71.0 (No AJCC staging schema)
         HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) = MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA, NOS
 
     The LYMPHOMA schema takes precedence over the BRAIN AND CEREBRAL MENINGES
     schema.
 
 22) MELANOMA OF THE SKIN
     SIXTH EDITION
 
     For AJCC Sixth Edition Melanoma of the Skin cases the user was unable to
     enter TNM codes N88 or M88.  This has been fixed.
 
 23) UTL *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]
      RS Registry Summary Reports [ONCO UTIL-SUMMARY REPORT]
       A Annual
 
     The RS Registry Summary Reports A Annual option now has an additional
     input prompt: "Analytic cases only? YES//".
 
     If the default response of YES is accepted, the report will only display
     analytic cases: CLASS OF CASE (0-2).  If the user responds NO, both
     analytic and non-analytic cases will be displayed.
 
 24) UTL *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]

     A COUNT has been added to the reports generated by the above options.
     At the end of each report a COUNT of the number of patients will be
     displayed.
 
 25) GRADE/DIFF/CELL TYPE (#165.5,24)
 
     The following field name has been changed:
 
     Old name: GRADE/DIFFERENTIATION
     New name: GRADE/DIFF/CELL TYPE
 
 26) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
      RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-RECURRENCE]
     SUBSEQUENT RECURRENCES (#165.5,72)
 
     The SUBSEQUENT RECURRENCES portion of the above input option has been
     removed.  Existing SUBSEQUENT RECURRENCES data will be retained for display
     purposes.
 
 27) "Out of order" options removed
 
     The following options which were placed "Out of order" in patch
     ONC*2.11*43 have been removed:
 
     In the SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ... [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU] menu:
