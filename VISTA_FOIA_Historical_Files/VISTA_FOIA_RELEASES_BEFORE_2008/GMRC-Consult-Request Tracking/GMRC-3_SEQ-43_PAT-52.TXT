Description:
============

 This patch is being released along with SD*5.3*478 (Scheduling), and 
 PX*1.0*176 (Patient Care Encounter) in host file: SD_53_P478.KID
  
 The Consult/Scheduling Appointment Link modifications include:
  
    1. It provides a new option to set up the linkage between entries in 
       the Consult Services file (#123.5) and the Clinic Stop file (#40.7).
  
    2. For consult services that have stop codes associated with them, the 
       scheduler is asked if they would like to associate a consult or 
       procedure request with an appointment.
  
    3. It automatically updates the status of linked consults or procedures
       when appointments are no-showed, cancelled or rescheduled.  This
       will increase the likelihood that medically sensitive consults are
       re-assessed rather than lost into the system when a patient no-shows
       a "consult-initiated" appointment.
  
    4. It automates the documentation of consult/procedure status for
       appointments that are no-showed or cancelled when patient letters 
       are printed (e.g., if a consult-linked appointment is no-showed the
       consult will automatically be updated with the following comment,
       "No-show letter printed").
  
    5. It will send a notification [via COMMENT] to the initializing 
       provider of the consult when an appointment that has been linked to
       a consult is rescheduled, cancelled or marked as a no-show, even if
       the consult is an interfacility consult.
  
    6. It will add a reason for appointment cancellation to the consult 
       when using the Scheduling option, Cancel Clinic Availability.
    
    7. It will display "CONS" in the Scheduling package Appointment Profile
       to indicate a consult request has been associated with the
       appointment. 
  
 The following modifications are implemented in this patch, GMRC*3.0*52:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  A new field multiple, ASSOCIATED STOP CODE (#688), is added to the
     REQUEST SERVICES file (#123.5).
  
 2.  A MUMPS cross-reference ('AF') is added to the CPRS STATUS field (#8) 
     of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) that will remove the scheduled
     consult link, if one exists, when a status change goes back to a
     Pending (5) or Active (6) status.
  
     A MUMPS cross-reference ('AD') is added to FORWARDED FROM field (#6)
     of the REQUEST PROCESSING ACTIVITY subfile (#123.02) of the
     REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) that will remove the scheduled
     consult link, if one exists, when a consult is forwarded to another
     service.
  
 3.  SERVICE CONSULTS SCHEDULE-MANAGEMENT REPORT (NEW) 
     A new routine called SERVICE CONSULTS SCHEDULE-MANAGEMENT REPORT was 
     created and placed on the CONSULT TRACKING REPORTS menu of the 
     Consult/Request Tracking (GMRC) package. This report functions in a
     similar way as the "SERVICE PENDING CONSULT RESOLUTION REPORT." It
     will provide individual listings of all consults within a time frame
     and/or a summary listing.  The report will identify patients placed on
     the EWL after the initializing date/time of the consult for a SERVICE
     with the same stopcode as the consult.
  
 4.  A post-installation routine for sites running the Class 3 version of 
     Consult/Scheduling Appointment Link will be performed.  This post-init
     process will go down the Class 3 ^GMR(123.5,"AB" cross reference and 
     populate the new ASSOCIATED STOP CODE field (#688).
  
 5.  The SD*5.3*478 patch brings in a new option called CONSULT ASSOCIATED
     STOP CODE [SD ASSOCIATED STOP CODE].  It is a new stand alone option
     that is used to assign stop codes to consult services.  It will need
     to be assigned to the site person (maybe the Clinical Applications
     Coordinator(s)) who will be managing these clinic/consult services
     "links".
