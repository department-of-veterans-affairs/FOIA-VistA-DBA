Subject: ADD LOGICAL LINK FOR FHIE

Category: 
  - Enhancement ()

Description: 
============

 The purpose of this patch is to export the VAFHIE entry in the
 HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.  The VAFHIE node is distributed
 with data in the following fields:
  
     NODE: VAFHIE
     INSTITUTION: AUSTIN
     LLP TYPE: TCP
     DOMAIN: FHIE.MED.VA.GOV
     EXCEED RE-TRANSMIT ACTION: restart
     ACK TIMEOUT: 240
     TCP/IP ADDRESS: 10.224.50.0           
     TCP/IP PORT: 5000
     TCP/IP SERVICE TYPE: CLIENT (SENDER)
  
 The Federal Heath Information Exchange (FHIE) will
 require this enhancement for viewing data from facilities outside
 the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).  Patch HL*1.6*92 is
 distributed as an EMERGENCY patch because it needs to be in place
 at all facilities to enable FHIE to begin data transmissions by April 25, 
 2002.
  
 Instructions in patch XM*999*148 must be followed prior to
 installing patch HL*1.6*92.  XM*999*148 is an informational patch
 with directions for creating the FHIE.MED.VA.GOV domain.
  
 Test Sites:

 The following is a list of the routine(s) included in this patch.  The
 second line of each of these routine(s) will look like:
  
 ;;1.6;HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN;**[Patch List]**;JUL 17, 1995
 CHECK^XTSUMBLD results:
  
 Routine       Before Patch       After Patch      
 --------      ------------       ------------     
 HLP92             N/A              7643045         
 HLP92ENV          N/A              1183086        
  
 Environment Check Routine HLP92ENV:
 ===================================
 The environment check routine, HLP92ENV, checks to see if patch
 XM*999*148 is in place.  It does this by checking for the existence
 of the FHIE.MED.VA.GOV entry in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  If the
 entry is not found, the routine aborts with the following message:
  
     "No DOMAIN (#4.2) file entry was found for FHIE.MED.VA.GOV.
     Follow the instructions in VA MailMan patch XM*999*148 to create
     this new entry in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  After the new DOMAIN
     has been created, re-install patch HL*1.6*92."
  
 Pre-Install Routine PRE^HLP92:
 ==============================
 The pre-install routine, PRE^HLP92, looks for the AUSTIN (Station Number 
 200) entry in the INSTITUTION (#4) file.  If the entry is present, the 
 pre-install is done.  If the entry does not exist, it is created.  This 
 entry is pointed to from the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file by the VAFHIE 
 entry distributed in this patch.
  
 Post-Install Routine PST^HLP92:
 ===============================
 The post-install routine, PST^HLP92, sets the AUTOSTART (#4.5) field
 to Enabled for the VAFHIE entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.
 Then, it examines the system to determine if it is the production or
 test account.  If it is the production account, the post-install is
 finished.  If it is a test account, the TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01) and
 DOMAIN (#.03) fields for the VAFHIE entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870)
 file are removed to ensure that messaging does not occur from a test
 account.
  
 When Installing in Test Account:
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch in your test account, confirm that the 
 DEFAULT PROCESSING ID (#.03) field in the HL COMMUNICATION SERVER 
 PARAMETERS (#869.3) file is set up properly according to the instructions 
 for the creation of a mirror account.  In programmer mode, enter the 
 following command.
   
 >W $$PARAM^HLCS2
 45^FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV^T^51^ISC SALT LAKE CITY^^3^HL7^25^30^85^30
   
 If the third piece of the returned data is NOT "T", then the steps for 
 mirroring a test account should be reviewed and updated.

          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
          patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
