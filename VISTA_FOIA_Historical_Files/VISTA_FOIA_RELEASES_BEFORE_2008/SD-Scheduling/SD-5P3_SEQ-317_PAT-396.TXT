Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 have appointments on same day.  Appointment management 
 indicates encounters are inpatient appointments but encounters

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 DUB-0704-32029  Action required for inpatient appointments
  
 Problem:
 
   Encounter action required report indicates action is required 
   on inpatients who are discharged from hospital to NHCU and 
   have appointments on same day.  Appointment management 
   indicates encounters are inpatient appointments but encounters
   are on the action required report as if they require checkout.  
    
  Resolution:
 
   The routine SDSTAT will be modified to properly handle appointments on 
   the day of discharge/admit.  The routine was not updating the Outpatient
   Encounter File #409.68 with each movement since it saw the appointment
   date as the same as the admit date.
    
   It has been determined that there are only a few such incorrect 
   entries. A cleanup routine SD53396P has been created that will
   fix the incorrect inpatient appointment entries.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 
   This patch can be installed at any time but because some options will 
   be out of service during the installation process, it is suggested 
   that it be queued for non-peak hours.  Users do not need to be off
   the system.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
 
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
   
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
   
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*396):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.   
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*396.
   
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
   
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
     you would like to place out of order, enter:  
   
          DG ADMIT PATIENT             Admit a Patient
          DG DISCHARGE PATIENT         Discharge a Patient
   
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
   
 Installing this patch does NOT do the file cleanup. After installing the 
 patch, we recommend that you run TASK^SD53396P. The task that will locate/fix
 the incorrect entries will be automatically queued to run in the background. 
 
 After you check Taskman to verify the task has completed, you may view the 
 corrected records by running REPORT^SD53396P.  The report is only designed to
 send output to the screen.  If you want to print the output, you will need to
 turn on screen capture and then print the output.
