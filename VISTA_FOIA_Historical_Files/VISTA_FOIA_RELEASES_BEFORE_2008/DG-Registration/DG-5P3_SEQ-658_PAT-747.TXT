Subject: STOP UPDATE OF FIELDS IN PTF

Category: 
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the PTF data entry screen to make the State, Zip Code,
 County, Sex and Date of Birth fields uneditable.
  
 Users have been able to update the State, Zip Code or County in the PTF
 but not make updates to the rest of the address fields, creating a
 potential to adversely affect patient safety in terms of Rx mailouts, etc.
 Changing the Sex and Date of Birth in the PTF bypasses the catastrophic
 edits built into the DG Load/Edit Patient data option.  
  
 All of these updates should be make via the DG Load/Edit Patient data 
 option.  For these reasons, this patch is being released as an emergency
 patch.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD176740 - PTF allows editing of a portion of the address creating
            inconsistency
  
   Problem:
   --------
   It was reported that the PTF software allows editing of the State, Zip
   Code and County, which changes those values in the patient file. 
   It does not change the street addresses or the city, leaving that 
   data intact, possibly creating an inconsistency in the address.
   It was also noted that Sex and Date of Birth could also be edited 
   thereby bypassing critical edits. 
  
   Solution:
   ---------
   Input templates, DG101, DG101F, DGQWK and DGQWKF will be changed so that
   those fields will not be editable.
