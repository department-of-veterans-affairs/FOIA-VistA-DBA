Subject: CMAC 2005

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charges (CMAC) charges have been redesigned 
 beginning with 2005.  This patch will allow the new CMAC charge structure 
 to be uploaded into the Charge Master, so the charges may be applied to 
 bills.  The following are the specific changes included in this patch.
                                        
 Special Note:  Implementation of CMAC 2005 is a two step process.  The 
 first step is installation of this patch, which is mandatory.  The second 
 step is uploading CMAC charges and is optional, depending on if your site 
 uses the CMAC.
                                        
 The effective date of the new CMAC charges is 04/01/05.
                              
 The CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charges (CMAC) charges have been redesigned 
 to define 4 Categories of charges.  Two of these categories of charges 
 will be available to sites:
                                        
 Facility/Physician Charges:  Services of Medical Doctors (MDs), Doctors of 
 Osteopathy (DOs), optometrists, podiatrists, psychologists, oral surgeons, 
 occupational therapists, speech therapists, physical therapists, and 
 audiologists.
                                        
 Facility/Non-Physician Charges:  Services, of all other providers not 
 found in category 1.
                                        
 There are two additional Categories for 'Non-Facility' type sites.  All VA 
 sites have been identified as 'Facility' type sites, therefore only the 
 CMAC 'Facility' type charges will be uploaded.
                                        
 Two Charge Sets will be created in the Charge Master to contain all 
 corresponding charges and will be set up as Professional charges:
 - CMAC xxx FAC/PHYS charges correspond to the first category.  
   These charges will be used as the default when adding charges to bills.
 - CMAC xxx FAC/NONPHYS charges correspond to the second category.  
   These charges must be manually selected on a bill to be used.
                                        
 The effective date of the CMAC 2005 charges is 04/01/05.  If sites have 
 continued billing with the old CMAC charges for care after this effective 
 date, then there may be inconstancies in the charges for the secondary 
 bill.  If the primary bill for care after 4/1 was created before this 
 patch, then the old charges were used on that bill.  If the secondary bill 
 is created after the new charges are installed, then the new charges will 
 be used on the new bill.  This will result in different charges on the 
 primary and secondary bills.  To use the same charges for both the primary 
 and secondary bills the charges on the secondary bill will have to be 
 manually changed to the old charges.
                                       
 The CMAC charges may be set up so the charges for specific procedures are 
 associated with specific revenue codes.  The instructions to do this are 
 at the end of the charge upload instructions below.
                                         
 The Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option has 
 been updated to be able to read the new CMAC files and to store them in 
 the Charge Master.  The process is similar to the upload of previous 
 versions of the CMAC, except now the required Charge Master elements will 
 be automatically created rather than manual.  This includes:  Charge Sets, 
 Billing Regions, and linking the Charge Sets to Rate Schedules that are 
 already linked to other CMAC sets.
                                        
 The Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option has 
 been modified to automatically delete any CMAC Charge Sets and their 
 related elements if the charges are not loaded, so CMAC Charge Sets with 
 no charges are automatically deleted.
                                        
 The Delete Charges from the Charge Master [IBCR DELETE CHARGE ITEMS] 
 option has been modified to allow the deletion of CMAC Charge Sets and 
 their related elements if all the set's charges are being deleted.
                                        
 During the patch installation, all CMAC charges currently defined in the 
 Charge Master will be inactivated.  The inactivation date used for a 
 particular charge will be the date of the next valid charge or 03/31/05.  
 This is essentially a clean-up to ensure only the new charges will be 
 effective on/after 04/01/05.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
                   
 The Post Init will loop through the Charge Master Charge Item file 
 (#363.2) inactivating all old CMAC charges.  This will ensure they will 
 not be used inappropriately after the new charges are loaded.  
 Routine: IBYPPL

 Install Time - less than 10 minutes.  
                                 
 The Post-init will loop through the Charge Item file (#363.2) inactivating 
 existing CMAC charges.  Therefore, the amount of time required for install 
 will vary from site to site depending on how many CMAC charges are loaded.

 6.   UPLOAD CMAC 2005 Charges
      ------------------------
      Follow the instructions below, if needed.
                                        
                                       
 ******* POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Uploading CMAC Charges *********
                                       
                                       
 Upload of the CMAC charges is required only if your site uses the CMAC.  
 The following are the steps necessary for uploading CMAC 2005 charges.
                                        
 Set-Up Steps:
 -------------
                                         
 1.  Determine if CMAC charges are needed at your site.  
     Only continue if your site does use CMAC.
                                         
 2.  Compile the list of Divisions CMAC charges are needed for.  
     This list should include both the Division number and the zip code of 
     the location of the division.
                                         
 3.  Obtain the sets of CMAC charge files required, in ASCII.  
                                         
     These files are available at:  http://vaww.cf.webdev.va.gov/vadod
                                         
     Select CMAC Rates, then CMAC Rates.  Enter the zip code of a primary 
     site that requires CMAC charges.  A file of CMAC charges will be 
     created for the Locality which contains the entered zip code.  Right 
     click on the 3-digit code in the Locality Code column and save the 
     file to your local system.  This 3-digit code is the Locality the 
     charges apply to.
                                         
     The CMAC charges are based on a Locality code.  Many zip codes are 
     contained within each Locality.  Therefore, it is likely that one set 
     of CMAC charges will be applicable to several divisions.  
                                         
     Complete the process for each division zip code charges are needed 
     for.  If the same file, as identified by the 3-digit code, is created 
     for multiple division zip codes, then only one is needed, but make note 
     of all the divisions that are contained within that locality.
                                         
     The CMAC files created will be named:  2005CMACxxx.TXT w/xxx is 
     locality.
                                         
 4.  Move the CMAC files to a directory accessible to VISTA.  Use ASCII.
                                         
 CMAC Upload into VISTA:  
 -----------------------
                                         
 5.  Enter Charge Master IRM Menu [IBCR CHARGE MASTER IRM MENU] option, 
     then Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option.
                                         
 6.  Select 1.1  Load CMAC into XTMP.
                                         
     If there are any CMAC files already loaded, then they will be listed.
     Delete them and continue.
                                 
 7.  Enter the correct Path where the CMAC files were placed in 4.
                                         
 8.  All available CMAC files will be displayed.  Enter the file to load.
                                         
     Note:  CMAC 2005 files name format:  '2005CMACxxx.TXT'
            CMAC files pre-2005 format:   'CMACxxx.TXT'
                                         
 9.  If component charges are desired, then enter the appropriate Modifier.
                                         
     Professional Component Modifier: // 26
     Technical Component Modifier: // TC
                                         
 10. Calculate and Compile CMAC charges into Charge Master form.
                                         
     Enter Yes to 'Proceed with upload now'
     The required Charge Master elements will be automatically created:
     -  Billing Region (there will be a warning about no division)
     -  Charge Sets (2) will be created if not already defined.
        >> CMAC xxx FAC/PHYS
        >> CMAC xxx FAC/NONPHYS
     -  The Charge Sets will be added to Rate Schedules that already have 
        other CMAC charges assigned.  
        >> If there are no Rate Schedules with CMAC assigned then these 
           will have to be added manually. (see step 14)
     -  Division will be asked.  Enter all Divisions whose zip codes are 
        covered by the Locality, as determined in step 3.
        >> These charges will only be applied to the divisions added.  
           Therefore if no division or not all needed divisions are added 
           here then they must be added after the upload.  (see step 15)
                                         
     The end result of this step is a set of temporary VISTA files 
     containing the CMAC charges in a form appropriate for loading into the 
     Charge Master.
                                         
 11. Check Data Validity of charges created
     Select 3 Check Data Validity and print the result.  It is expected 
     that there will be one duplicate charge and 14 Wxxxx procedure charges 
     that can not be found.  This is ok.
                                         
 12. Load charges into the Charge Master
     Select 4 Load into Charge Master.  Select a device to print the 
     result.  The results should be a clean load except for the 14 Wxxxx 
     procedures which can not be loaded.
                                         
 13. Repeat Steps 6-12 for each CMAC Locality file needed.
                                          
                                          
 14. Add new Charge Sets to Rate Schedules, if necessary.
     When the charges are set up in step 10, it will add the new Charge Sets 
     to any Rate Schedule that already has CMAC charges assigned.  If none 
     were found, then the following message is displayed and the links must 
     be manually set.
      *** Warning: CMAC 359 FAC/PHYS not added to any Rate Schedule,
          set manually using Enter/Edit Charge Master option.
     Add the new Charge Sets to Rate Schedules for the Billing Rates that 
     should be billed using CMAC:
     Use the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER] option
     Select Action RS - Rate Schedule, then add the new Charge Sets to the 
     appropriate Rate Schedule.  All 'FAC/PHYS' should be AUTO = Yes.  All 
     'FAC/NONPHYS' should be AUTO = BLANK.
                     
 15. Add Divisions to new Billing Regions, if necessary.
     When the charges are set up in step 10, it will add the new Billing 
     Region that defines the divisions that may use the charges.  If no 
     division or not all necessary divisions were added, then they need to 
     be assigned after the upload.  Any division not assigned to a CMAC 
     Billing Region will not be able to use the CMAC charges.
     
     Add all divisions covered by a CMAC locality to the corresponding 
     Billing Region:
     Use the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER] option
     Select Action CS - Charge Set, then Select Action RG - Billing 
     Regions, then add the Divisions to the appropriate CMAC Billing Region.
                                       
 16. Optional:  Add Revenue Code - CPT links for CMAC.
     The CMAC charges may be set up so the charges for specific procedures 
     are associated with specific revenue codes.  To do this use the 
     Revenue Code - CPT links functionality.  There are two options:
                                       
     a.  Use the Standard Revenue Code Links already defined.
                                       
     If the Revenue Code CPT links already defined will work for the CMAC, 
     then assign the CMAC to the current set.
                                       
     In the Charge Master Main Menu, use the Print Option V-Rev Cd Links to 
     print out the existing links to determine if these will work for the 
     CMAC.
                                       
     If the existing links are ok, then assign the CMAC to the existing 
     special group:  in the Enter/Edit Charge Master, SG - Special Groups, 
     ED - Edit Special Groups:
                                       
           Select Action: Quit// ED   Edit Special Groups  
                                       
           Enter/Edit a Special Group: 
                                       
           Select BILLING SPECIAL GROUPS NAME: STANDARD RVCD LINKS
             REVENUE CODE LINK
                                       
           This was exported Nationally, only the assigned Billing Rates 
           may be edited.
           This group has associated Revenue Code Links.  Type can not be 
           edited.                                      
                                       
           Select BILLING RATE: RC PHYSICIAN MN// CMAC  
             CHARGE SET: 
             ORDER: 
           Select BILLING RATE: 
                                       
     b.  Create new Revenue Code - CPT Links just for CMAC.
                                       
     If the Revenue Code CPT links already defined will NOT work for the 
     CMAC, then create a new set of links just for the CMAC.
                                       
     Create the new links Special Group:  in the Enter/Edit Charge Master, 
     SG - Special Groups, ED - Edit Special Groups:
