Description: 
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
   This patch provides a new executable called the CPRS Query Tool.  It 
   allows users to generate the predefined reports, or to build a custom
   report containing clinical information for a list of patients.  While 
   originally designed to be used with the list of patients on the
   Hepatitis C Registry, the software allows selection of groups of 
   patients from team lists, providers, hospital locations, etc.  The CPRS 
   Query Tool will help users to follow-up on the status or on the results
   of orders, documents and appointments.  Only users that hold the ROR VA 
   HEPC USER security key will be able to access the Hepatitis C Registry
   patient list.
  
   In addition, the patch addresses an undefined Mumps error that occurred 
   when using the Microbiology Results Entry option.
  
 NOTE:
   Users must have the "ORRCM REPORTING" option assigned in order to use
   the CPRS Query Tool application.
  
 PARAMETER: 
   ORHEPC ABNORMAL START - Abnormal Result Enabled Date
   This parameter may be set for a system. It is used to store the initial
   creation date for the "Abnormal Result Flag" in the order file. When a
   user queries the abnormal result report, the available abnormal report
   start date will refer to the value of this parameter. This parameter is
   set automatically during the patch installation.
