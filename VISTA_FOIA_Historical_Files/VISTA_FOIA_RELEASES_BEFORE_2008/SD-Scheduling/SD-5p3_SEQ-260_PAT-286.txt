Subject: ADD STATION NUMBER TO HL7 PRIMARY CARE MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 NOTE: This patch is being implemented in a phased release to minimize
 the impact to network traffic and inbound messages received by the
 Austin Automation Center (AAC.) A representative from Systems Design
 and Development (SD&D) will contact each site individually and,
 assist that site, when it is their scheduled time to reseed the PCMM
 patient data. Even though the patch is in a Released status, the
 software will not be available to the sites until it is their install
 time. It is critical that sites install and implement this patch
 immediately when contacted by SD&D. Legacy system installs will be
 addressed by SD&D in their initial contact with each site.
  
  
 This patch adds a new sequence to the ZPC-VA Specific Primary Care 
 Information Segment that follows PID- of the Transmission of PCMM Primary 
 Care Data. That new sequence #9 is the STATION NUMBER field (#99) (may 
 include suffix) of the INSTITUTION file (#4). The description of HL7 
 Interface Specification for the Transmission of PCMM Primary Care Data 
 will be updated accordingly. The Austin Automation Center must update 
 their receiving part to capture the STATION NUMBER.
  
 The patch was developed in a response to the IT Service Request "Add 
 Institution field to PCMM Patient HL7 Message" submitted by Kathy Frisbee 
 of VSSC on 11/14/2002.  After a review of this request, STATION NUMBER
 described above is added with this patch.
  
 The POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY(#404.52) file is scanned to retrieve 
 the STATUS(#.04) field, if the STATUS(#.04) is active, the record is 
 reseeded. The reseeded messages are sent to the PCMM HL7 MESSAGES
 mail group, transmission errors are sent to the PCMM TRANSMISSION
 ERRORS mail group.  Again, it is critical that each site install and
 implement this patch immediately when contacted by SD&D.
  
 The PROTOCOL(#101) file entry PCMM SEND SERVER FOR ADT-A08 field 
 SENDING APPLICATION(#770.1) is edited from the old HL7 APPLICATION 
 PARAMETER(#771) of PCMM-212 to the new entry (added with this patch)
 PCMM-213.  The FACILITY NAME(#3) field in the new PCMM-213, HL7
 APPLICATION PARAMETER(#771) file should be set the to appropriate 
 facility number.
  
 A new error code is included with this patch. Error code "390M" is 
 added to the PCMM HL7 ERROR CODE(#404.472) file.  It is for invalid
 facility Number/Suffix field added with this patch.
  
 The option PCMM Team file Institution check [SCMC PCMM TEAM FILE CHECK]
 created with this patch. The option should be used to display any 
 TEAM(#404.51) file entries that are not "NATIONAL" INSTITUTION(#4) file
 entries. This is a standalone option that is not attached to any menu.

 During the phased implementation the distribution file will be made
 available to each site individually when contacted by SD&D.  Sites
 should immediately install and implement this patch.
  
 After full implementation is completed, the listed distribution file
 may be obtained using FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at 
 DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV or from specific servers at the Albany
