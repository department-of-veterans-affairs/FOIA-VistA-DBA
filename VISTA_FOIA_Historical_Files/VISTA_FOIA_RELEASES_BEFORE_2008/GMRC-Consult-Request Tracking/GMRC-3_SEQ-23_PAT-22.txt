    (XU*8.0*206 post-install) has been completed at your facility.
  
 2. Although the MASTER PATIENT INDEX VISTA (name space MPIF) package can

    ensure that it is installed and patched up to date in all systems where
    Inter-facility Consults will be implemented.
  
 3. The installation of this patch will file three new VistA mail groups 
    which will be used to deliver mail messages and alerts to staff as a 
    result of problems with proper functioning of Inter-facility Consults.
    During installation, a coordinator will have to be named for each of 
    the three mail groups. Refer to the IFC Implementation Guide for a 
    complete explanation of the three mail groups and their purpose. The 
    coordinators for the mail groups should be decided prior to
    installation and entered during installation.
