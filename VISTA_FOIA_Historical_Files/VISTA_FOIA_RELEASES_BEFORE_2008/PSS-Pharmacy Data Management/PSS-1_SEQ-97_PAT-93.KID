1. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 has requested a 
"BLD",5613,1,2,0)
new Application Programming Interface (API) from Pharmacy Data Management 
"BLD",5613,1,3,0)
V. 1.0. The new API will allow CPRS to request the current status of any 
"BLD",5613,1,4,0)
order for both Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 
"BLD",5613,1,5,0)
7.0. 
"BLD",5613,1,6,0)
 
"BLD",5613,1,7,0)
2. During internal testing, it was discovered that the Expected First 
"BLD",5613,1,8,0)
Dose display in CPRS was inconsistent for PRN orders. If a provider 
"BLD",5613,1,9,0)
checked the PRN box, no Expected First Dose is displayed. However, if the 
"BLD",5613,1,10,0)
schedule selected had PRN in the name, an Expected First Dose is 
"BLD",5613,1,11,0)
displayed which is not correct. This patch assists in correcting this
"BLD",5613,1,12,0)
problem by modifying the TYPE OF SCHEDULE field (#5) in the ADMINISTRATION
"BLD",5613,1,13,0)
SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to allow PRN. This information will then be provided
"BLD",5613,1,14,0)
in an API to CPRS. PSI-05-026.
