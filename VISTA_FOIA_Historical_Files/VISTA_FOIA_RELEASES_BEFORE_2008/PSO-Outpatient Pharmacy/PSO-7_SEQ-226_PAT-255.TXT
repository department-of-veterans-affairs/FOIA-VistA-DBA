Subject: SEND ADDITIONAL DRUG NAMES TO EXT. DISPENSE DEVICE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 *** This patch addresses Patient Safety Information - PSI-06-086 ***
  
 This patch will correct certain scenarios where bottle labels printed 
 through the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) External
 Dispense machines have a slightly different drug name than when sent to
 Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) or printed locally.  More
 information will be sent to give the Vendor's dispense machines access to
 additional drug names, in use by the VA's local labels and CMOP labels.
  
 This patch will also correct an issue where the Method of Pickup was not 
 being included in the HL7 message sent to the External Dispense machines
 in the RXE segment. This only occurs when Method of Pickup is all alpha
 characters.
  
  
 ****NOTE TO SITES****
 All sites will need to check with their individual external dispense 
 vendors to make sure they make the appropriate changes to accommodate the 
 new fields for the OPAI message.  An outlook message was sent to known
 vendors of changes, but it is the ultimate responsibility of each site to
 verify updates are done by vendor.
  
  
 Associated Remedy:
 ==================
 HD91817       Print problem with HL7
 HD143942      Method of Pick-up HL7 problem for window fills.
  
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD91817       Print problem with HL7
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A site noticed that when a CMOP drug is printed locally for window 
 pickup, the drug name that appears on the label printed by OPAI and the 
 External Dispense machines, does not agree with the CMOP label for that 
 same prescription.
  
 It was then noticed upon investigation, that the OPAI labels did not 
 always agree with the drug name printed on Local labels.  The local 
 labels would print any one of three drug names.   
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change was needed to the OPAI HL7 segments to send more information to 
 give the Vendors dispense machines access to additional drug names in use 
 by the VA's local labels and CMOP labels.
  
 New fields called Label name and VA PRINT NAME will be sent to the 
 External Dispense machines in the HL7 RXE.21.2 & RXE.21(1).2 segments 
 respectively.
  
  
 2. HD143942      Method of Pick-up HL7 problem for window fills. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the Method of Pickup field was all alpha characters, this field was
 not inserted into the HL7 message RXE segment sequence 8 and went on to
 the External Dispense Machines.  Only when this field began with a 
 numeric character was it being sent.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Alter routine PSOHLDS2 to test for the existence of any non-null value 
 and send it via the HL7 RXE.8 field.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  The Outpatient Pharmacy Technical Manual/Security Guide has been
  updated to reflect modifications to the HL7 messages sent to the 
  external interface.  The changes are found in Appendix A of the manual.
  
  The revised Outpatient Pharmacy Technical Manual/Security Guide
  is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following
  Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. This file needs to be retrieved
  in binary format.
   
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
   (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
       download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
       first available FTP server.
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
       specific server as follows:
   
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
