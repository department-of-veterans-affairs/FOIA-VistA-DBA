Description: 
============

 1) NOIS #WPB-0702-32552
   
    The caption "PERFORMED AT:" and "PERFORMED BY:" are mispelled in the
    Endoscopy Report for Paracentesis procedure.  The print
    template has been modified to fix that.
  
    Options: Endoscopic Report [MCFPGI]
             Brief Endoscopic Report [MCBPGI]
  
  
    Print Template: MCNONENDOPARAC        FILE #699
   
   
 2) Routines MCARAM5, MCAREO, MCARGEO, MCARPACE, MCARPCE, MCEO, MCPFTE,
    MCPFTI, and MCRH1 have been modified.  Old calls to the GMRCR routine
    have been removed due to the fact this interface was no longer active with
    the release of CPRS in 1997.  The user will no longer need to answer
    the question:
