Subject: CORRECT ALERT SURROGATE PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING **
  
 If your site does not purge old alerts the post install routine,
 which reindexes the "B" cross-reference of the FILE: ALERT TRACKING
 (# 8992.1), may take considerably longer than would be the case if you
 regularly purge.  In that case, you will want to schedule the
 installation so the post installation routine may run on a weekend or
 overnight.
  
 --------------------------- End of Warning -------------------------
  
 1. Surrogates for processing alerts may have an end date and time for the
 surrogate relationship.  The actual removal of the surrogate has been
 performed when the next alert was sent to an individual.  This resulted,
 however, in the user still appearing to have a surrogate after the
 stated end time if another user tried to set them as their surrogate.
 This patch modifies the processing so that the removal of the specified
 surrogate happens on any surrogate related look-up after the specified end
 time.  This will correct the problem that had been reported (E3R #14940).
  
 2. Code has been modified to correct problems identified with setting
 surrogates (BRX-1000-10427, COS-0401-41366, WRJ-1201-11337).
  
 3. The problem indicated as a mismatch in XQAID values (ISL-0200-52883) is
 handled by a re-indexing of the "B" cross-reference in FILE: ALERT
 TRACKING (#8992.1) in the post-installation routine.
  
 4. A small change was made in XQALERT to clarify the way in which alerts
 are referenced from the menu system (ISL-0898-51279) and to correct a
 potential problem with matching the "B" cross-reference in FILE: ALERT
 TRACKING (#8992.1).
  
 5. A cross-reference was added to FIELD: SURROGATE (#.02) of FILE: ALERT
 (#8992) to permit rapid lookup of users who have specified a selected user
 as their surrogate (E3R #15158).  This is made available via the "XQAL
 SURROGATE FOR WHICH USERS" (View Surrogate for Which Users) option on the
 XQALERT MGR menu.  The supported reference API SUROFOR^XQALSURO has been
 added for other applications to access this data.
  
     D SUROFOR^XQALSURO(.LIST,USERDUZ)
  
 will return data in the variable LIST.  The value of LIST indicates the
 number of entries returned.  The array list will return the users DUZ
 value in file 200 and the NAME (.01) field from file 200 separated by an
 '^'.
       LIST = 3
       LIST(1) = "54^LNAME1,FNAME1"
       LIST(2) = "75^LNAME2,FNAME2"
       LIST(3) = "247^LNAME3,FNAME3"
  
 The post-install routine, XQAL173P, also builds the cross-reference for
 current surrogates.  This routine is set to be removed following the
 installation.
  
 6. In addition, it was noted that while interactive specification of a
 surrogate checked for cyclic relationships among surrogates, the API for
 non-interactive setting of a surrogated (SETSURO^XQALSURO) simply set the
 specified surrogate.  While this API can continue to be used, a new API
 (SETSURO1^XQALSURO) has been created which should be used to obtain a
 return value (1 if successful, 0 if not successful) indicating whether the
 surrogate could be set.
  
   S VAL=$$SETSURO1^XQALSURO(USERDUZ,SURODUZ,STRTDATE,ENDDATE)
  
  
 Where USERDUZ and SURODUZ are the internal entry numbers in file 200 for
 the user and selected surrogate, respectively.  STRTDATE and ENDDATE are
 optional date/time values for when the surrogate relationship should
 start and end.  If STRTDATE is not specified, the surrogate becomes active
 immediately.  If ENDDATE is not specified, the surrogate remains active
 until another surrogate is specified or the surrogate is removed.

 Installation Instructions:
  
      1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
      installation but if you have not recently run a scheduled purge of
      old alerts you may want to schedule the installation for off hours.
  
      2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
      3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
      System) package onto your system.
  
      4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
      5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options:
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
            Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":
            Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                =======
             Install Package(s)
             Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*173
                                  ==========

             Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
 YES// NO
       ==
             Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
                                                                   ==
             Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? YES// NO
                  ==
  
      6.  AXP Sites - Answer 'NO' to the question 'Want to MOVE
      routines to other CPUs?'.
  
      7.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
