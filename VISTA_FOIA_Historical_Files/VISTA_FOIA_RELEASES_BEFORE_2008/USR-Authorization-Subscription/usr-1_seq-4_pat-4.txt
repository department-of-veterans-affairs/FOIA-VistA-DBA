 options allow examination but not editing of User Class Memberships.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1.  Options:  USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP
               USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS
               USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP BY USER.
 These three new options provide the User Class examination without edit
 functionality.  USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP is a menu option for the other two. 
               USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS
               USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY USER
 The entry action was changed so that USRTMPL was set to the List
 Template to use before calling MAIN^USRMLST and MAIN^USRULST
 respectively.
  
 2.  List Templates:  USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS
                      USR SHOW MEMBERSHIP BY USER
 These new list templates provide the screens for examining User Class
 memberships.
  
 3.  Protocols:  USR SHOW USER MEMBERSHIP MENU
                 USR SHOW CLASS MEMBERSHIP MENU
 These new protocols are used by the list templates in item 2 to provide
 their actions.
                 USR CLASS ACTION QUIT
                 USR CLASS MEMBER USER CHANGE VIEW
                 USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP CHANGE VIEW
 These protocols must be included in the patch so that the Kernel Build
 can properly create the protocol menu structure.
  
  
 4.  Routines:  USRMLST
                USRULST
 Changed the call to EN^VALM to use the argument USRLTMPL.  USRTMPL
 contains the name of the List Template that EN^VALM is to use.  USRTMPL
 is set in the option that invokes MAIN^USRMLST or MAIN^USRULST.
