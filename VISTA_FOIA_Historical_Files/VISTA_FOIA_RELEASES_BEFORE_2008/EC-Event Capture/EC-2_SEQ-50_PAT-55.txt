 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. ATG-1003-32110     CANNOT INACTIVATE SCREEN ON INACTIVE CPT CODE
       
    Problem:
    --------
    Since the installation of Code Set Version (CSV) patch EC*2.0*47 the 
    user cannot update some screens for a DSS unit. If the user tries to 
    inactivate a screen/procedure for which the CPT code is inactive, the 
    GUI will not allow the user to inactivate. The user receives 
    a pop-up message that says: "Invalid Procedure" and is prevented 
    from continuing with the transaction.
        
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Code changes were made to ECMFECS and ECHECK1 routines. Code 
    Q:$G(ECIEN) was added to the procedure code validation line in the 
    ECMFECS routine (line tag VALDATA). ECIEN is the IEN of the
    EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file.
        
    Problem:
    --------
    In ECS roll-n-scroll, if the CPT code is inactive, the procedure code 
    will not appear on the event code screen display list.  
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Code '$G(ECACTIV) was added to the validation line of remove 
    inactive procedures code in ECHECK1 routine (line tag SET). The 
    ECACTIV variable allows users to select inactivate procedures from 
    the Inactivate Event Code Screens option.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
    
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 2 minutes.
    
     Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
    
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
    
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
    
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
    
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*55)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
    
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        EC*2.0*55.
    
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
    
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
        and Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
    
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
