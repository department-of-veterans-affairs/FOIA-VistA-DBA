Subject: C&P TEMPLATE UPDATES

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 The goal of the Compensation and Record Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation 
 and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) project is to implement the current
 Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) compensation and pension
 exam worksheets in an electronic format that will upload exam results into
 Text Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
 CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*91.  This CAPRI GUI
 version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
 the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
 exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
 Please refer to the user guide for further information on CAPRI CPWM.
  
 No new functionality is being provided with this patch.  This patch only 
 corrects errors and makes necessary updates to the C&P examination 
 templates accessible through CAPRI CPWM.  For a complete listing of all 
 the template updates provided by this patch, please refer to the release 
 notes document associated with this patch outlined in the Documentation 
 Retrieval section of this patch description.
