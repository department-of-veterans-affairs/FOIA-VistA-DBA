Subject: %ZOSVK* Routines Needed for RUM and SAGG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticipation
 of the national release of the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) Version 1.0
 and Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software
 packages.
  
 This patch will not affect the current versions of the RUM and SAGG
 software that is running at the sites.  Therefore, all DSM, MSM and
 OpenM-NT sites are instructed to install this patch.  Test sites which had
 a pre-release of SAGG v 1.8 should also install this patch.
  
 This patch, in conjunction with the future release of SAGG v 1.8, will
 support the collection of global growth data from the following operating
 system platforms: DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT.  
  
 This patch distribution will be adding new %ZOSV* routines to the 
 system-specific manager routine set.  The accompanying installation
 instructions will guide you in adding these routines to your system.
  
 This distribution also contains the following two routines within the new
 KMP* namespace:
  
    KMPENV      An environment check routine which determines which 
                system-specific collection routines should be installed.
                The system variable ^%ZOSF("OS") will be used to determine
                the type of system on which this distribution is running.
  
    KMPLOAD     A loader routine that will be used to rename the ZOSVK*
                routines to %ZOSVK*.
  
 Capacity Management (CM) has been assigned the KMP* namespace for
 routines.  Both of these routines are only necessary for the installation
 of this distribution and can be deleted after successful completion of
 this patch.
                
        
 Installation:
 ============
  
 The installation of this patch does not affect any options.  Therefore,
 this installation can be performed at any time of the day with minimal
 disruption to users.  Provided the information that is listed immediately
 below does NOT apply to your site's configuration, installation should not
 take longer than 10-15 minutes.
  
  
 NOTE:  If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, review the 'NOTE' section in Step 7
        to determine if additional preparation work is necessary.
  
    
   1.   If you are either a 'DSM for OpenVMS' or 'MSM-DOS' site, you will
        not need to review your mapped routine sets since these new
        routines are not presently mapped.
  
  
   2.   Load the patch distribution onto your system by following these
        instructions:
  
        Enter 'X' at the 'Select MESSAGE Action: IGNORE//' (or DELETE//)
        mail prompt and select the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.
  
  
   3.   From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' (KIDS) menu,
        select the 'Installation' menu.
  
  
   4.   You may now elect to use the following options: 
  
              When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter XU*8.0*90
                                                        =========
  
        a.    Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this release.  It will
              NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
        b.    Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
              release is installed.  It compares all components of the
              release (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
              
        c.    Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
  
        
   5.   Use the 'Install Package(s)' option and select the package
        XU*8.0*90.
        =========
  
  
   6.   When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.
    
        
   7.   If you are either a 'DSM for OpenVMS' or 'MSM-DOS' site, after
        successful completion of the installation, move and restore the
        KMPLOAD and ZOSVK* routines to the MGR UCI(s) with the ^%RS and
        ^%RR system routines.
        
        If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must also move these routines to
        all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file and shadow
        servers.   
        
        
        NOTE:   If you are a 'OpenM-NT' site, you must verify that the
                routine mapping configuration on each of your NT system(s)
                contains %ZO* or, at least, %ZOSV*.
               
                You MUST review the mapping configuration on ALL of your
                NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
                VANETB.DEF).
                
                If needed, you will also need to modify ALL of your
                NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
                VANETB.DEF).
                
                Use the following instructions to complete this task:
                
                On the 'Open M NextGen Thin Client' buttons, click on the
                'Configure Open M' (i.e., Wizard) button.
                
                On the top menu line of the 'Open M Configurations' window:
                
                   Select File
                          -
                     Edit Network Configuration...
                          
                On the top menu line of the 'Open M - Namespace/Network
                Configuration' window:
                
                   Select File
                          -
                     Open Configuration [Remote]...
                
                A 'Choose Connection' window opens:
                
                   Choose the appropriate 'Connection' to your NT system
                
                     Click the 'OK' button
                
                Select the correct system from the 'File Name' box
                
                *** You will need to review ALL of your ***
                ***         VISTA configurations        ***
                
                     Click the 'OK' button
                
                Click on the 'Routine Mapping' radial button  -> o
                
                Review the entries and ensure that the following is
                present:
                
                 Routines       Type      Destination Location
                 --------       ----      --------------------
                 %ZO*           ALL       ROU
         (or, at least, %ZOSV*)
                       
                If the above is present, continue to Step 8.
                
                However, if the above is NOT present, click the 'Insert
                Mapping' button and add %ZO* to the routine mapping list.
  
                Then, on the top menu line of the 'Open M Namespace/Network
                Configuration' window:
                
                   Select File
                          -
                     Save Configuration
                
                Restart OpenM after making this change on ALL VISTA
                configurations of the OpenM-NT cluster.
                
                Review ALL of your NT-VISTA configurations and make the
                appropriate modifications, if necessary.
                
                After restarting your OpenM systems, you will log into the
                VAH UCI to complete the next step.
                
        
   8.   All sites must run the KMPLOAD routine in order to rename the
        system specific collection routines to the %ZOSVK-namespace.
  
  
        NOTE:   If you are a 'DSM for OpenVMS' site, you must have
                performed Step 7 and be logged into the MGR UCI in order to
                complete this step as shown below.
  
        NOTE:   If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must have performed Step 7
                and be logged into the MGR UCI.  You must run this routine
                on all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file
                and shadow servers as shown below.
  
        NOTE:   If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, you must have verified the
                routine mapping for every node configuration as outlined in
                Step 7.  You must be logged into the VAH UCI in order to
                complete this step as shown below.
        
        
        Now, once logged into the appropriate UCI as defined above for your
        site, run the KMPLOAD routine.
  
        > D ^KMPLOAD
     
          Loading ZOSVKRx      Saved as %ZOSVKR
          Loading ZOSVKSxE     Saved as %ZOSVKSE
          Loading ZOSVKSxS     Saved as %ZOSVKSS
  
          Finished
  
        NOTE:  The above listing of routines is only shown as an example.
               The listing that you will obtain will vary depending on your
               system configuration.
                
        
   9.   The KMP* and %ZOSVK* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to
        be mapped.
