Subject: VISTALINK AS TCP/IP SERVICE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  This patch contains information to aid IRM site staff in running
  VistALink Listener(s) on an M server as a TCP/IP service.  This patch
  pertains to the Cache/VMS operating system only.
  
  Advantages to running VistALink Listener(s) as a TCP/IP service 
  include the ability to run the TCP/IP service on multiple nodes in a 
  cluster.  This allows for an uninterrupted Listening process by 
  redirecting the job should one of the nodes in the cluster go down. Also,
  the TaskMan process does not need to be running on the same node as the
  node the VistALink Listener(s) reside on.
  
  Test sites currently running VistALink as a TCP/IP service:

    o Boston
    o Brooklyn which includes:
        o Northport
        o Hudson Valley  (formerly Montrose and Castle Point)
        o NY Harbor      (formerly Brooklyn and Manhattan)
    o Greater LA HCS

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
    1) If VistALink v1.0 Listeners were previously managed using the 
       Foundations Management menu [XOBU SITE SETUP MENU], perform the 
       following steps:
  
       a)  Stop all VistALink Listeners.  Under the Foundations Management
           menu [XOBU SITE SETUP MENU], select STP Stop Listener to stop
           each running Listener.
  
       b)  To help prevent accidental Listener startup from within Cache,
           Listener startup configurations (including the DEFAULT
           configuration) should be removed from the system prior to
           running VistALink as a TCP/IP service. From the Foundations
           Management menu [XOBU SITE SETUP MENU], select CFG Manage
           Configurations and '?' to find the name of each configuration.
           Enter the name, and use the '@' sign to delete the record.
  
    2) Delete the XOBV LISTENER STARTUP job from the OPTION SCHEDULING file
       (#19.2) which is set to queue during startup.  From the Taskman
       Management menu [XUTM MGR], select Schedule/Unschedule Options,
       enter Start VistALink Listener Configuration [XOBV LISTENER
       STARTUP], and use the '@' sign to delete the record.
  
    3) A cookbook and associated command files to enable and manage 
       VistALink TCP/IP services have been written by HSITES and can be
       downloaded from the [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE] directory at the 
       following FTP sites:
  
      OIFO                  FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
      ====                  ===========                  =========
      Vista Download Site   download.vista.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
      Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
      Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov      anonymous.software

      VLINK_CREATE_UAF.COM              Used to create OpenVMS user account
      VLINK_CREATE_SERVICE.COM          Used to create the TCP/IP service
                                        for VistALink
      VLINK.COM                         Used by the VistALink service
  
    4) For further assistance with set-up of a TCP/IP service, please
