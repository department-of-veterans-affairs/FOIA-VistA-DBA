The body's response to insult can be documented as one of three levels 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,3,0)
with each successive level building on the previous level. You should

only document the highest level identified using the criteria below. 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,5,0)
 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,6,0)
1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): SIRS is a widespread
"DATA",136.5,3,1,7,0)
inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical insults. This
"DATA",136.5,3,1,8,0)
syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two or more of the
"DATA",136.5,3,1,9,0)
following:
"DATA",136.5,3,1,10,0)
 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,11,0)
   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C
"DATA",136.5,3,1,12,0)
   - HR >90 bpm
"DATA",136.5,3,1,13,0)
   - RR >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg(<4.3 kPa)
"DATA",136.5,3,1,14,0)

"DATA",136.5,3,1,15,0)
     forms
"DATA",136.5,3,1,16,0)
   - Anion gap acidosis (this is defined by [sodium + potassium] - 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,17,0)
     [chloride + CO2]. If this number is greater than 12, then an 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,18,0)
     anion gap acidosis is present.
"DATA",136.5,3,1,19,0)
 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,20,0)
2. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this
"DATA",136.5,3,1,21,0)
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS listed
"DATA",136.5,3,1,22,0)
above and one of the following:

organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status,

"KRN",19,9653,1,4,0)
 
"KRN",19,9653,1,5,0)
Two varieties of this report are available.  The first variety provides a
"KRN",19,9653,1,6,0)
report of all patients who had operations within the selected date range
"KRN",19,9653,1,7,0)
who experienced introperative occurrences, postoperative occurrences, or
"KRN",19,9653,1,8,0)
death within 90 days of surgery.  The second variety provides a similar
"KRN",19,9653,1,9,0)
report for all risk assessed operations that are in a completed state but
"KRN",19,9653,1,10,0)
have not yet transmitted to the national database.
"KRN",19,9653,1,11,0)
 
"KRN",19,9653,1,12,0)
Variety #1:
"KRN",19,9653,1,13,0)
Report information is printed by patient, listing all operations for the
"KRN",19,9653,1,14,0)
patient that occurred during the selected date range, plus any operations
"KRN",19,9653,1,15,0)
that may have occurred within 30 days prior to any postoperative
"KRN",19,9653,1,16,0)
occurrences or within 90 days prior to death.  Therefore, this report may
"KRN",19,9653,1,17,0)
include some operations that were performed prior to the selected date
"KRN",19,9653,1,18,0)
range and, if printed by specialty, may include operations performed by
"KRN",19,9653,1,19,0)
other specialties.  For every operation that is listed, the intraoperative
"KRN",19,9653,1,20,0)
and postoperative occurrences are also listed.  Also, the report includes
"KRN",19,9653,1,21,0)
information about whether the operation was unrelated or related to death
"KRN",19,9653,1,22,0)
and the risk assessment type and status (if assessed).  The report may be
"KRN",19,9653,1,23,0)
printed for a selected list of surgical specialties.
"KRN",19,9653,1,24,0)
 
"KRN",19,9653,1,25,0)
Variety #2:
"KRN",19,9653,1,26,0)
Report information is printed by patient in a format like the first
"KRN",19,9653,1,27,0)
variety.  This report lists all risk assessed operations that are in a
"KRN",19,9653,1,28,0)
completed state but have not yet transmitted to the national database and
"KRN",19,9653,1,29,0)
that have intraoperative occurrences, postoperative occurrences, or death
"KRN",19,9653,1,30,0)
within 90 days of surgery.  The report includes any operations that may
"KRN",19,9653,1,31,0)
have occurred within 30 days prior to any postoperative occurrences or
"KRN",19,9653,1,32,0)
within 90 days prior to death.  Therefore, this report may include some
"KRN",19,9653,1,33,0)
other operations that may or may not be risk assessed, and, if risk
"KRN",19,9653,1,34,0)
assessed, may have any risk assessment status (incomplete, complete, or
"KRN",19,9653,1,35,0)
transmitted).  However, every patient listed on this report will have at
"KRN",19,9653,1,36,0)
least one operation with a risk assessment status of 'complete'.

"^DD",130,130,250,21,6,0)
1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): SIRS is a widespread

inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical insults. This
"^DD",130,130,250,21,8,0)

following:

The Mallampati classification relates tongue size to pharyngeal size.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,3,0)
This test is performed with the patient in sitting position, the head 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,4,0)
held in a neutral position, the mouth wide open, and the tongue 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,5,0)
protruding to the maximum. The subsequent classification is assigned 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,6,0)
based upon the pharyngeal structures that are visible:
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,7,0)

The classification assigned by the clinician may vary if the patient is

in the supine position (instead of sitting). If the patient phonates,
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,16,0)
this falsely improves the view. If the patient arches his or her
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,17,0)
tongue, the uvula is falsely obscured. A class I view suggests ease of
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,18,0)
intubation and correlates with a laryngoscopic view grade I 99 to 100%
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,19,0)

"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,6,0)
1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome): SIRS is a widespread
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,7,0)
inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical insults. This
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,8,0)

following:

   - Anion gap acidosis (this is defined by [sodium + potassium] -

"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,21,0)
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS listed
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,22,0)

associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this

organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status,
