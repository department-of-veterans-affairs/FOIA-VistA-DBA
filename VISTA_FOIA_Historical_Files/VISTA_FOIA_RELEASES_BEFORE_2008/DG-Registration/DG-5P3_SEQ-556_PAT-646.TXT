  This patch will resolve the following issue:
 
  When attempting to upload Military Service Episode (MSE) data using the menu
  option 'Update HINQs to the Patient file' [DVB HUPLOAD], the Military Service
  information is not stored.  This problem is occurring when the patient does
  not already have a corresponding Military Service Episode on file (i.e. No
  MSE data present in the patient record).
 
  The user was attempting to populate the patient record via the HINQ option,
  however, the changes introduced by patch DG*5.3*626 (released 1/20/2005) are
  disallowing the change to the data.
  
  
  This patch addresses the following E3R(s):
  ------------------------------------------
  There are no E3Rs associated with this patch.
   
   
  This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
  ---------------------------------------------------
