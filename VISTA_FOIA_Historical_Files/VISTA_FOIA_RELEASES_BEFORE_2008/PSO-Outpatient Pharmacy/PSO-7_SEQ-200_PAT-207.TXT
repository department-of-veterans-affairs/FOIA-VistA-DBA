Subject: REMOTE DATA INTEROPERABILITY (RDI)

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch adds the capability of doing order checking between local VA 
 facilities and remote VA or Department of Defense (DoD) facilities where 
 veterans have received prescriptions. This Remote Data Interoperability 
 (RDI) functionality includes receiving data from the Health Data
 Repository (HDR) in order to perform the order checking against remote
 data.
  
 After the release of this patch, a Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) patch will turn on a flag which enables the remote order checking
 to occur. When turned on, the remote order checking includes checks for
 duplicate drugs, duplicate drug classes, drug interactions, and drug
 allergies.
  
 In addition to the new functionality, there are several help desk tickets
 related to erroneous drug interactions with non-VA meds. The problem
 and fix have been identified as a variable being carried over from prior 
 drug checks that should have been killed in between. Because the routine
 that needs to be fixed is already being changed as part of the RDI
 project, the change to kill the variable at the end of the interaction 
 checking will be included in this RDI patch.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites will retrieve VISTA documentation from the following FTP
  addresses.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
  available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation
  directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not
 install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are using the software.
 Installation will take no longer than 3 minutes. There are no scheduling
 restrictions or recommendations.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*207)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*207.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
