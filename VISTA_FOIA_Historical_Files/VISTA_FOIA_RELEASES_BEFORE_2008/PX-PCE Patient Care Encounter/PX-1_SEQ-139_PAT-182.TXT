Subject: DEFAULT DX DURING APPT CHECK OUT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix a problem that currently exists with the default 
 diagnosis code (DX).  When checking out an appointment, the user is
 presented with a default diagnosis code, if one exists for the applicable
 clinic. When the user accepts the default, the system appears to accept
 the selection and continues with the check out process.  
 However, the software does not actually accept the default and the
 appointment is placed in an Action Req/Checked Out status.  
   
 This patch will also fix a problem which occurs when a user is entering a
 diagnosis code for a Patient Care Encounter (PCE) procedure.  
  
 Third, this patch will also fix a problem which occurs when a user is
 creating and checking out a Standalone Encounter.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD119328 - Default DX during Appt Check Out
     duplicates:
     HD120378- Diagnosis code not showing up on check out
     HD121032- PCE problems
     HD121971- Clinic is set up with a default diagnosis, but it is not

     HD136333- DUPLICATE OF 119328
     HD137247- Default DX listed in PCE, but default not accepted.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When checking out an appointment, the user is presented with a default
    diagnosis code, if one exists for the applicable clinic.  When the user
    accepts the default, the system appears to accept the selection and
    continues with the check out process.  However, the software does not
    actually accept the default and the appointment is placed in an Action
    Req/Checked Out status.  If the user views the appointment through the
    Display Detail [PCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY] option, there is no diagnosis
    code for the appointment, even though the user accepted the default
    diagnosis.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PXBPPOV will be modified so that the system will properly
    accept the default diagnosis, when applicable.
  
 2) HD165189 - Invalid code when entering diagnosis for PCE procedures
  
    Problem:
    --------
    This is a sporadic problem that only occurs under certain conditions.
    When a user goes into PCE to edit an existing encounter and they
    elect to edit the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code they are
    prompted to enter Diagnosis 1 for the procedure.  Once it is entered
    and all the additional prompts have been answered, they will then be
    prompted to enter Diagnosis 2 for the encounter.  If they enter a
    partial diagnosis code, such as 123, they will be presented with a list
    of possible matches.  The problem occurs if the user chooses to
    up-arrow ("^") out at this point.  No error occurs, but the Encounter
    Profile will then display INVALID CODE for the secondary diagnosis.  
    And, a -1 will be stored in the V CPT (#9000010.18) file, where it
    would normally store the pointer to the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file for
    the secondary diagnosis code. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PXCECPT will be modified to check if the user has entered
    an up-arrow ("^") at the prompt described above and properly quit
    without storing the invalid code/pointer.
  
 3) HD143463 - If no PROCEDURE, only option is to DELETE encounter
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user creates and checks out a Standalone Encounter, if they
    do not enter a procedure code during the check out interview, they
    are prompted with:
  
        Must have a STOP CODE or a PROCEDURE to complete this action.
        Do you want to delete this encounter?  NO//
  
    However, the system does not allow the user to accept the default
    of "NO" and they are forced to delete the encounter.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PXBAPI1 will be modified and a new API added, so that when
    the user does not enter a Procedure code during the Check Out
    Interview, the new API will be called and they will be see the
    same prompt shown above.  However, they will now be able to accept
    the default of "NO" and preserve the encounter in a status of Action
    Required, or they can answer "YES" and delete the encounter.
