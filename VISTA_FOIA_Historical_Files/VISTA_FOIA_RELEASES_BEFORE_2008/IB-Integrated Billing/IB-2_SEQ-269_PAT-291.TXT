Description:
============

 This patch includes three minor changes to third party claims processing
 in Integrated Billing.
  
 1.  The first change is a modification to the printed claim forms.  After
 release of the EDI Enhancement patch (IB*2*232) that converted the VistA
 electronic claims to HIPAA compliant format, an issue was identified
 regarding the printing of the provider's SSN on the claims.  A 'quick fix'
 was implemented in a subsequent patch (IB*2*290) that prevented the
 provider's SSN from EVER being printed locally on these two forms.  This
 patch provides the final long term fix for this issue where the SSN ID is
 printed locally ONLY if it is required to do so by the payer. For HCFA
 1500 claims that are sent electronically, and the payer requires a
 performing provider's SSN to print on the claim form, the SSN is sent as a
 secondary ID.  WebMD is changing their print logic ONLY for the HCFA 1500
 to check for the SSN as a secondary ID before printing it at Express Bill.
 Because WebMD will not be able to print the SSN on the UB92 claim forms,
 if an insurance company requires the SSN to print on the UB92, these
 claims MUST be printed locally.
  
 Two new parameters were added to the option for INSURANCE COMPANY
 ENTRY/EDIT [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT] to allow the site to indicate, for
 each insurance company, whether the provider's SSN is required to print on
 the UB92 and the HCFA 1500 claim form.  These new parameters are found
 under the PROVIDER ID (ID) action on the main menu.
  
 The print form locators affected by this change are:
  
          UB92: PERFORMING PROVIDER ID data in form locators 82 and 83   
     HCFA 1500: REFERRING PROVIDER ID data in box 17A
  
  
 2.  The second change is a modification to the transmitted claims.  The
 EDI Enhancement patch (IB*2*232) added a restriction to the field output
 for the billing facility's GROUP or PIN number so it could no longer be
 overridden by the output formatter.  It has since been discovered that the
 standard VistA software does not accommodate all of the provider ID
 scenarios required by payers.  As a result, this field will be re-opened
 for sites to add a local override for this data element if deemed
 necessary.
  
  
 3.  The third change included in this patch is a correction to the text 
 displayed for the provider function when using the ?ID action within the 
 billing screens.  Only the rendering/attending provider function is
 displayed correctly.  For all other provider functions, the wrong function
 type may be displayed.  For example, the REFERRING provider's name and id 
 may be reported as the OPERATING provider.
  
  
 Technical Description:
 ----------------------
  
 The code to determine the default performing provider ID was modified in 
 routine DEFID^IBCEF74.  The change was made so that the performing 
 provider's SSN is used as a default provider secondary id only if there is
 no other secondary id that is valid for the insurance company and provider
 combination AND if the new parameter for the claim form type indicates an
 SSN is required for the performing provider ID on printed forms.
  
 The code to send the provider's SSN as a secondary provider ID if the 
 corresponding parameter for the insurance company and form type indicates
 the provider's SSN should print on a HCFA 1500 claim was added in routine 
 PROVINF^IBCEF74.
  
 The code to force a UB92 claim form to print locally for an insurance
 company that requires the SSN as the secondary id to print locally was
 added to routine IBCBB21.  The logic is used if the new UB92 parameter is
 set for an EDI activated insurance company (or the following insurance
 company in the case of an MRA request), AND the insurance company does not
 have an electronic routing id or the id ends in PRNT.  A new error message
 was added to the billing inconsistencies checks that will be displayed
 when the conditions are met for this change.
  
 The two new parameter fields were added to the INSURANCE COMPANY file
 (#36) and are REQUIRE SSN ID FOR HCFA PRINT (#3.11) and REQUIRE SSN ID FOR
 UB92 PRINT (#3.12).  The routine IBCNSC1 was modified to display these new
 parameters in list manager.  The input template [IBEDIT INS CO1] from 
 the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) was modified to allow editing of these
 two new fields.
  
 The output formatter file entry modified to allow the local override is found
 in file IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION (#364.6) and is entry #1316.  The
 field modified was LOCAL OVERRIDE ALLOWED (#.07) and was set to 1 (YES).
  
 The code to fix the text displayed for the provider function when using 
 the ?ID action in the billing screens is fixed in routine DISPID^IBCEF74.
 The wrong variable was being used as the basis of the interpretation of 
 the provider function code.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should be installed after normal working hours when no 
 Integrated Billing users are using the system. Install Time - 2 minutes or
 less. Other VISTA users will not be affected.  The following menus/options
 should be disabled prior to the start of the installation:
  
         Integrated Billing Master Menu [IB MANAGER MENU] 
         Billing Supervisor Menu [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR MENU]
         Billing Clerk's Menu [IB BILLING CLERK MENU]
         Insurance Company Entry/Edit [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT]
  
 Also, make sure the auto-transmit of electronic claims option (Queue Auto
 Transmit EDI Bills [IBCE 837 AUTO TRANSMIT]) is not scheduled to run while
 the patch is being installed.  It's best to check with your Billing section
 on this.  There is an IB Site Parameter (file #350.9) called HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT BILLS (field #8.06) that may contain specific times to transmit
 bills.  If there are no specific times set up in this parameter, claims will
 be transmitted when the [IB MT NIGHT COMP] job runs.
