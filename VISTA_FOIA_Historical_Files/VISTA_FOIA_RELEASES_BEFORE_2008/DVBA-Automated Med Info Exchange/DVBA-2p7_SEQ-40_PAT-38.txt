 DVBA_2_7_35_38B.EXE        BINARY         CAPRI GUI
  
  
 Installation Process:
  
 The CAPRI GUI requires that the RPC Broker V1.1 be installed on any PC on
 which the GUI will be executed.  If a PC can already connect successfully via
 CPRS, BCMA, or PCMM, then the RPC Broker has already been installed. If you
 need to install the RPC Broker, please refer to the RPC Broker website
 (http://vista.med.va.gov/broker/download.html) for configuration information
 and to download the installation file if you do not already have it.  
  
 There are two ways to install CAPRI:
  
 A.  If you have configured the PC via the serverlist.exe application that
 comes with the RPC Broker installation file, the CAPRI GUI can be copied
 directly to your Windows desktop.  If you need more information on
 serverlist.exe, please refer to the RPC Broker user manual.
  
 B.  If you have only loaded the RPC Broker on the PC but not configured it
 using server list, CAPRI will default to BROKERSERVER, port 9200 when
 executing the application.  If you wish to default to a different server and
 port, use the following instructions:
  
 1.  Copy CAPRI to a folder on the PC, preferably c:\program files\vista.
 2.  Create a shortcut on the desktop to CAPRI by right clicking on a blank
 region of the desktop and selecting NEW | SHORTCUT.
       a. When asked for location type the location in which CAPRI GUI has
          been placed on the hard drive along with your local server and
          port information as parameters:
          "C:\Program
 Files\VISTA\dvba_2_7_35_38B.exe"s=vista.yoursitename.med.va.gov p=9200  
            (The quotes must be included.)
       b.  Press NEXT.
       c.  When asked for name, type:  CAPRI GUI
       d.  Press FINISH.
  
 After creating the icon on the PC:
  
 Assign  DVBA CAPRI GUI as a secondary option for the user who will be using
 the CAPRI GUI client.   This will provide access to the GUI context option and
 allow CAPRI to start-up successfully when the user logs-in from the desktop
 icon.
  
 This process is similar to the installation instructions for all other RPC
 Broker-enabled applications, such as CPRS, BCMA, and PCMM.
