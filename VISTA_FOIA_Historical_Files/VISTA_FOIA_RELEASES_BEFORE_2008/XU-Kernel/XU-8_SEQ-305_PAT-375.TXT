Subject: SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME EDIT

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem with editing the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED 
 NAME field(#20.2) of the New Person file(#200).
  
 The problem occurs when the input transform of the Signature Block 
 Printed Name field (#20.2) and the input transform of the Name field 
 (#20) process a New Person name in different ways, and then the Signature 
 Block Printed Name field is manually edited. For example, the problem 
 will occur for "TEST L", since the input transform of the Signature Block 
 Printed Name field will transform the input to "TESTL", while the input 
 transform of the name field will leave it as "TEST L".
  
 The patch has a post-installation routine that will automatically run 
 upon patch installation. The post-install routine will change the Data 
 Dictionary of the Signature Block Printed Name field to call the same API 
 as the input transform of the Name field.
