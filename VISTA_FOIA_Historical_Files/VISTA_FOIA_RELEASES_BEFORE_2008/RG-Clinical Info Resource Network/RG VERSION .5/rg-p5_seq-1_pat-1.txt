Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the undefined errors in the Duplicate Record
 Statistics [RGCIRN CMOR DUP STATS] and the null subscript error in the
 Pseudo-SSN Report [RGPR PRE-IMP SSN REPORT] option. This patch also
 incorporates changes to the Start/Restart CMOR Score Calculation [RGCIRN
 CMOR START] and CMOR Score Calculation Status [RGCIRN CMOR STATUS] options
 as well as changes to reduce the time of calculation.  The CMOR INIT
 STATUS field (#24) in the CIRN SITE PARAMETER file (# 991.8) was also
 updated to reflect the changes in the CMOR Score Calculation Status
 [RGCIRN CMOR STATUS] option.
