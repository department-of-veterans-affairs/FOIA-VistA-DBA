Description:
============

  ****************************** NOTE ******************************
  There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
  Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause 
  any problems.
  ******************************************************************
  
 This patch will resolve two separate DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) Special
 Handling issues, and an issue regarding the holding and subsequent removal
 from hold of CMOP (Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy) prescriptions.  
 
 1. CHA-0204-30749
    Currently, if the NARCOTICS NUMBERED DIFFERENTLY (#1000) field in the
    OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file is set to Yes, all prescriptions that have
    a drug with a DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field if file DRUG (#50)
    that contains an "A" (Narcotics) are numbered differently than other
    prescriptions.  This patch will change the check of the DEA, SPECIAL
    HDLG (#3) field in the DRUG (#50) file to check for all Schedule II
    drugs denoted by a "2" in the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field,
    instead of just an "A".
    
 2. CAH-1203-31567, DUB-0204-30722, NYH-120311822, WPB-1203-31609
    The functionality exists to modify the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field
    of the DRUG (#50) file to contain an "F".  This code signifies that
    this drug in not refillable.  If the # OF REFILLS (#9) field of the
    PRESCRIPTION (#52) file is modified after the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3)
    field has been changed to an "F", the # OF REFILLS (#9) field for
    the prescription is automatically reset to 0.  This is causing the
    prescription display to show the 'Refills Remaining' as a negative
    number. This patch will change how this situation is handled.  If a
    prescription has refills and the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field has been
    changed to include an "F", the # OF REFILLS (#9) field will be changed to
    the actual number of refills given and the following message will be
    displayed:
    "The drug has been changed and no longer allows refills."
    If no refills had been given, the # OF REFILLS (#9) field will be set to
    0 and the following message will be displayed:
    "No refills allowed on this drug."
 
 3. FGH-1203-31351
    If a prescription was transmitted to CMOP, and then put on hold, it
    removes the fill date. It is then released and when the hold is
    removed, it does not prompt for a fill date since it is released,
    therefore the possibility exists that if the Fill Date is blank the
    subsequent fills will be rejected by the CMOP transmission.
    This patch will prompt the user for a fill date with a default of
    the released date if a prescription is unheld after it is released
    and fill date field is blank.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  This patch should be installed after hours, when no Outpatient
  Pharmacy users are on the system.
 
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7*166) 
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
       b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7*166.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
