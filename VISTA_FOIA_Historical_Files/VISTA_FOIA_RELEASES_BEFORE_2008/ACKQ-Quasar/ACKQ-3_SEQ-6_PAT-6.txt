   This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
   Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
   routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
   the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
   implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT and
   HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
