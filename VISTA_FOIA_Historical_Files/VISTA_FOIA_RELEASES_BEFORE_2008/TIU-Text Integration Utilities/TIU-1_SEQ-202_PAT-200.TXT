Subject: TIU Generic HL7 Interface

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch provides a generic HL7 interface to Text Integration Utilities.  
 The interface will allow TIU to receive and process unsolicited HL7 
 messages and update existing documents or create new documents.
  
 Please refer to the TIU Generic HL7 Interface Handbook for specifics on how to 
 configure the interface.
 
 This patch also provides a new List Manager application for the management of 
 HL7 messages that have been processed by the TIUHL7 interface.  Messages may
 be viewed, deleted, and reprocessed via the List Manager application.  The new
 option is available on the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU] as
 item #6 TIUHL7 Message Manager.

 This patch is a required patch for the Home Telehealth/Vista Integration 
 program. The titles listed below are the agreed upon titles by the Office of 
 Care Coordination for the Home Telehealth program. In order for the Home 
 Telehealth interface to work, the titles must be an EXACT match. You will be 
 prompted to install the titles during installation. You may choose not to 
 install the titles if desired. If YES is selected to install the titles, any 
 titles that already exist in 8925.1 as an EXACT match will simply be ignored 
 and no changes will be made for that entry; only titles that do not yet exist 
 will be added to 8925.1.  Therefore it is highly suggested that 
 you review the list of titles and the document class that will be added to 
 File 8925.1 with this patch prior to installation.
