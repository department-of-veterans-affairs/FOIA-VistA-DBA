Associated patches: (v)SPN*2*22    <<= must be installed BEFORE `SPN*2*23'

Subject: REVISION OF OBJECT CODE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains revisions to the code in routines SPNETOBJ and 
 SPNOBJ, which support the creation of TIU objects.  The revisions have 
 been requested by users in the field.
  
 The revisions consist of:
  
    1) appropriate prefacing label for the data returned by the object. For
 example, instead of returning "C06", the code will return "SCI Level: C06"
  
    2) null data indicator when the object returns no data. For example,
 instead of returning null in the case where no data is on file, the code
 will return "No data available", as in "SCI Level: No data available".
  
 This patch is a required patch for TIU*1*171, and provides revised code 
 in support of TIU*1*171.  Patch TIU*1*171 will add the following TIU
 objects to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1):
  
    SCI BOWEL CARE DATE CERTIFIED
    SCI BOWEL CARE PROVIDER
    SCI BOWEL CARE REIMBURSEMENT
    SCI ENROLLMENT PRIORITY
    SCI ETIOLOGY
    SCI EXTENT OF SCI
    SCI LAST ANNUAL EVAL OFFERED
    SCI LAST ANNUAL EVAL RECEIVED
    SCI LEVEL
    SCI MARITAL STATUS
    SCI MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SUB TYPE
    SCI PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER
    SCI REGISTRATION STATUS
    SCI REMARKS
    SCI SCD COORDINATOR
    SCI VA SCI STATUS
  
 Upon installation of patches SPN*2*23 and TIU*1*171, the above TIU objects
 will be available to users at the site.

    General Information.
    ====================
  
 This patch should be installed into your production UCI.  It can be
 installed at anytime.  You may experience pauses during installation, but
 install time should not take more than five minutes. No options need to be
 disabled.  An environment check will be performed to ensure that the
 installing site has installed SPN*2.0*22.
  
  
    Installation Instructions.
    ==========================
  
    Users of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction package may remain online during
    installation.
  
    This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:
  
      1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build
           onto your system.
      2) Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
           Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
           the mapped set at this time.
      3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use options:
           a) 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global'.  This verifies that
              all routines have the correct checksums.
           b) 'Backup a Transport Global'.  This option will create a 
              backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
      4) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option 'Install
           Package(s)'.  Select the package 'SPN*2.0*23' and proceed with
           install.
      5) It is recommended that you answer 'NO' to each of the following
           questions:
               a) 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
                   Install?'
               b) 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
               c) 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
                   Protocols?'
      6) If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
           returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
           completion.
