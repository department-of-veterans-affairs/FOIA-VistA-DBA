Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 Patch PXRM*1.5*7 was released without the VA-MST SCREENING packed
 reminder. This patch distributes and installs the packed reminder.
  
 Once patch PXRM*1.5*9 has been installed, follow the directions for term
 mapping in the patch PXRM*1.5*7 Clinical Reminders MST Functionality
 Installation and Setup Guide, if necessary. After the setup is done the
 MST synchronization should be run. If the synchronization was run before
 patch PXRM*1.5*9 was installed it must be run again.
  
 The packed reminder IHD POST MI FOLLOW UP was erroneously installed in
 the REMINDER EXCHANGE file (#811.8) by patch PXRM*1.5*7. In an attempt to
 clean this up, this patch will delete that REMINDER EXCHANGE file entry.
 If there is more than one REMINDER EXCHANGE file entry for that packed
 reminder, this patch will leave one of them in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file
 under the assumption that it existed prior to the installation of patch
 PXRM*1.5*7.
