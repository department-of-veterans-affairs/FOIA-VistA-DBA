 1)  NOIS: LON-0101-60810   Medicine Procedure not defined correctly
     This patch addresses a problem that was found by the Long Beach VAMC
     and OIFO-MARTINSBURG.  If Paracentesis procedure is entered using the
     Brief Enter/Edit GI Procedure Option [MCBLGI] and then viewed via the
     CPRS Report tab, the error "<UNDEF> GENERIC+4^MCARPAC" occurs. The
     MCARPS2 routine has been modified to use the Medicine Patient File
     (#690) "AC" cross-reference to find the report, instead of the
     Procedure/Subspecialty file (#697.2).  The new routine, MCARUTL5, will
     reverse validate the entry from the Procedure to the "AC"
     cross-reference to the indicated patient in Medicine Patient File
     (#690). The print template MCNONENDOPARAC has been added to support
     the Paracentesis Procedure entries in File 699.
  
   ROUTINE: MCARP
   Description:
     This routine has been modified to reflect the new print template
     for Paracentesis Procedures that were entered into File 699 instead of
     File 699.5.
  
   ROUTINE: MCARPS2
   Description:
     This routine has been modified to check if the requested 
     file entry from the "AC" cross-reference is the same as the file
     in File 697.2.  If they are different then it will default to the "AC"
     value. 
  
   ROUTINE: MCARUTL5
   Description:
     This routine is a validation routine.  It checks to see if the
     requested procedure entry and patient match. 
  
 2)  NOIS: ISM-0301-20176   <SELECT>BEGIN+4^MCOBHEM ERROR IN MCBPHEM
     This patch also corrects two HEMATOLOGY (#694) print templates. When
     the user selected Brief Hematology Report [MCBPHEM] option to print
     Hematology reports the print template would error out with a
     <$SELECT> if the report was a HEM procedure. Hematology Report
     [MCFPHEM] was updated to display the work correctly as well even
     though it didn't have an error. The print templates are MCARHEMB and
     MCARHEMBRPR. The options are Brief Hematology Report [MCBPHEM] for
     MCARHEMBRPR and Hematology Report [MCFPHEM] for MCARHEMB.
  
   ROUTINE: MCARHP
   Description:
     This routine has been modified to check if a patient had already
     been selected from another source such as CPRS.  If there was a
     patient selected the routine would skip the patient selection
     process.
