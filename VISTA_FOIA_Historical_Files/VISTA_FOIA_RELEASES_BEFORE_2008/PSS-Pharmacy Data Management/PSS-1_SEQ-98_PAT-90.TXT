Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*148
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*276
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*90
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*48
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (AR) V. 4.5                      PRCA*4.5*230
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
    
 This patch modifies PDM V. 1.0 to support the other applications in the
 electronic claims generation process. It does not interface with the ECME
 application at all. The changes to this application are the following:
  
 1. A new multiple field has been added to the DRUG file (#50) to store the
    latest NDC numbers that have been dispensed at window as well as by CMOP
    for a specific division. This way, when the next prescription is entered by
    the division for the same drug, the last used NDC is automatically
    retrieved from this new multiple, stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and
    sent to the third party payer through ECME. Below is the multiple field and
    the fields under it for the DRUG file (#50):
   
      32  NDC BY OUTPATIENT SITE
          .01   OUTPATIENT SITE  
            1   LAST LOCAL NDC        
            2   LAST CMOP NDC   
      
 2. DAW CODE field (#81) has been added to the DRUG file (#50) to store the
    DAW CODE. When a new prescription is entered for a specific drug, the DAW
    CODE from the drug is stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for each fill.
    This field is solely being used for electronic billing purposes. It 
    communicates to the third party payer that a drug has a special 
    characteristic, which will hopefully prevent the payer from rejecting
    the claim. Below are all 10 existing DAW CODES:
  
      0 - NO PRODUCT SELECTION INDICATED
      1 - SUBSTITUTION NOT ALLOWED BY PRESCRIBER
      2 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-PATIENT REQUESTED PRODUCT DISPENSED
      3 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-PHARMACIST SELECTED PRODUCT DISPENSED
      4 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-GENERIC DRUG NOT IN STOCK
      5 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-BRAND DRUG DISPENSED AS A GENERIC
      6 - OVERRIDE
      7 - SUBSTITUTION NOT ALLOWED-BRAND DRUG MANDATED BY LAW
      8 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-GENERIC DRUG NOT AVAILABLE IN MARKETPLACE
      9 - OTHER
  
    Note: The existing entries in the DRUG file (#50) will NOT be automatically
          populated with a DAW CODE value upon installation of this patch.
          However, the null value is automatically saved as 0 (zero) - NO
          PRODUCT SELECTION INDICATED in a prescription entered for a drug with
          a null DAW CODE.
    
 3. The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option has been modified to allow
    the user to associate a DAW CODE to a drug in the DRUG file (#50). 
  
 4. The Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option has been modified to
    display the DAW CODE field (#81) content for the drug being displayed.
    Below is the exact point where the DAW CODE is displayed:
    
    ...

     respond "NO."

     Protocols? YES//", respond "NO."

 16. TEST SITES ONLY: A post-installation step for test sites is to restart the 
     BPS NCPDP Logical link.  To turn on the logical link use the  Start/Stop 
     Links [HL START] option, which is on the Filer and Link Management Options 
     option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] 
     option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP" and 
     that will enable the logical link.
  
 17. The functionality will be implemented at sites in a phased schedule.
     Before performing the steps to activate ePharmacy functionality, all 
     non-test sites should wait to be contacted by the Chief Business 
     Office (CBO).
