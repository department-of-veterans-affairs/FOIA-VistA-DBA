Subject: Update to post-init for patch OR*3*138

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Patch OR*3*138, which fixed a number of POE related problems, contained
 a post-init to clean up the database.  A few sites have reported
 a problem with the post-init crashing before completing the clean up.
  
 This patch contains a modified version of the post-init that will fix
 the relatively rare problem that is causing the post-init from patch
 OR*3*138 to crash.  The cause of this problem will be fixed in another
 patch as it is not causing any problems with the database on a day
 to day basis.
  
 The new clean up routine, ORY145, will be the only routine included
 in this patch.  As most sites will have installed patch OR*3*138
 without a problem, most sites WILL NOT have to do anything once this
 patch is installed.  However, if your site experienced problems with
 the post-init in patch OR*3*138 you will have to manually run routine
 ORY145 to clean up your database.
  
 NOTE: Do the following ONLY if your site experienced problems with the 
 post-init in patch OR*3*138.
  
 From programmer's mode run ORY145.  Select the time for the job to run in 
 the background.  An example follows.
  
 DEV,CUR>D ^ORY145
  
  
 Database clean up routine ORY145.  This routine will
 run in the background and will fix any known database errors.
 It will then send a mail message to the initiator indicating what was 
 changed.
  
 Requested Start Time: NOW//  (APR 04, 2002@10:50:24)
 ORY145 queued to background as task number 5046582.
