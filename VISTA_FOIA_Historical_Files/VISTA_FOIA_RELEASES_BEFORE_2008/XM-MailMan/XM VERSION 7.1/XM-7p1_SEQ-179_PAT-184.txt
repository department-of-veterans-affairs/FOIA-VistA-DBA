Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*184
 
 NOIS: REN-0501-61866
 Test Site:  Reno, NV
 If a user, who does not hold the XMMGR key and is not a Postmaster
 surrogate, goes into SHARED,MAIL and attempts to resequence messages
 in a basket, MailMan tells the user he's resequencing, but then doesn't
 resequence them.  This patch fixes that.
 
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*177.
