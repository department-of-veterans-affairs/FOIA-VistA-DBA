 This patch will correct a problem with the display of Reference, Critical 
 and Therapeutic ranges in the Laboratory Test Description in the Lab Test
 information option of the Tools menu in CPRS GUI by routine LR7OR4. It 
 will correct a problem with the display of reference ranges with the
 patient's laboratory test data in both CPRS GUI and the Laboratory Package
 by routines LR7OGMC, and LRRP1.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 Problem (1):  
 ------------
 Some laboratory tests have only the high value of the reference range
 defined. These tests currently will display the data in this manner:
  
      Reference range: - 100
  
 This single value can be incorrectly interpreted as a negative.  Although
 it is displayed in CPRS GUI, the display is generated on the server by a
 Laboratory package routine - LR7OR4.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 A laboratory test with only the low value defined will now display in this
 manner:
  
      Reference range low: 10
  
 If the low value is free text, it will now display in this manner:
      Reference range: NORMAL
  
 A laboratory test which only has the high value defined will now display
 in this manner:
  
      Reference range high: 100
  
 If the high value is free text, it will now display in this manner:
      Reference range : >1500
  
 A laboratory test with both low and high values defined will now display 
 in this manner:
  
      Reference range low  : 10 
      Reference range high : 100
  
 And if both low and high values are defined and free text, it will 
 display:
      Reference range low  : NORMAL
      Reference range high : SEE COMMENTS
  
  
 Problem (2):
 ------------
 Some laboratories store embedded MUMPS code for reference ranges whose 
 values are based on the patient's sex, the patient's age, or both the
 patient's sex and age. This is currently being displayed as straight MUMPS
 code but is not useful to the users who are unable to read MUMPS code.
 Currently, it might display in this manner:
  
 Example # 1, based on patient's sex:
     Reference range: $S(SEX="M":39.8,1:34.9) - $S(SEX="M":53,1:46.0)
  
 Example # 2, based on patient's age:
     Reference range: $S(AGE<65:">4.0",AGE=65:">4.0",1:">3.5")
  
 The routine LR7OR4 displays this data as well.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify LR7OR4 to translate the MUMPS into a readable format.
 Example # 1 for ranges based on patient's sex: 
      Reference range
          Male low  : 39.8
          Male high : 53
          Female low  : 34.9
          Female high : 46.0
  
 Example # 2 for ranges based on patient's age:  
      Reference range
          If Age is less than 65 the low is >4.0
          If Age is equal to 65 the low is >4.0
          Default low: >3.5
  
 For ranges based on both the patient's sex and age the possible
 combinations of age and sex made breaking this out into more detail prone
 to error. It has been decided with the agreement of EVS to not break out 
 the embedded M code. This is what will print if the range contains both 
 sex and age:
     Reference range - Age and sex dependent range values, please contact 
                       lab for specifics
  
  
 Problem (3): 
 ------------
 The reference ranges when displayed with the patient's laboratory test
 results will display a dash high_value when the low value is null.
 (example: - 123). This is true in both CPRS GUI and in VistA.
  
 The laboratory package routines LR7OGMC, LRRP1, and LR7OSUM5 handle this 
 formatting for the different reporting options on the Lab tab in CPRS GUI.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify LR7OGMC, LRRP1, LR7OSUM5, LR70SUM6 to check the low and high
 reference values and format the display of the reference range values
 accordingly.
  
 Example # 1 If both the low and high reference values are defined then
 the output will be formatted:  50 to 123
  
 Example # 2 If only the low reference value is defined and it is numeric 
 the output will be formatted:  low: 50
  
 Example # 3 If only the low reference value is defined and it is 
 alphanumeric the output will be formatted:  NORMAL
  
 Example # 4 If only the high reference value is defined and it is numeric
 the output will be formatted:  high: 123
  
 Example # 5 If only the high reference value is defined and it is 
 alphanumeric the output will be formatted:  POS
  
  
 Problem (4):
 ------------
 This is an issue discovered by the test sites during testing. The 
 modification of the reference range display for the vertical cumulative
 reports had the side effect of making the horizontal cumulative report lab
 test headers to be crowded and unreadable.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Further modification of LR7OSUM5 to change the way the horizontal 
 cumulative reports created the lab test headers. This is an example of the
 reformatted horizontal cumulative report headers:
  
                        ---- LAB TEST GROUP ----
  
 SPECIMIAN            TEST 1        TEST 2        TEST 3        TEST 4
 Ref range low         low           low
 Ref range high        high                        high
                      units         units         units         units
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 The low and high values are given their own line to print. If a lab test 
 has both, then both will print. If a lab test has only the low or high
 defined, it will print on the appropriate line. If the lab test has
 neither defined, then nothing will print as in the example above.
  
  
 Problem (5):
 ------------
 This is an issue discovered by the test sites during testing. The 
 Miscellaneous test section of the cumulative report was not printing with
 the new formatting. In addition, if the lab test only had the high
 reference range value defined it did not print.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modification of LR70SUM6 to print the method of reference range value 
 display and correct the issue of the lab test with high value reference
 range only not being displayed. This is an example of the revised and
 corrected output from LR7OSUM6:
  
                         ---- MISCELLANEOUS TESTS ----
  
    DATE    TIME   SPECIMEN          TEST         VALUE         Ref ranges
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10/04/2006 17:54  BLOOD             CML-F:       201 H          high: 200
 10/04/2006 17:44  BLOOD             CML-F:       160            low: 100
 10/04/2006 16:28  BLOOD             CML-F:       150            100 to 200
 08/24/2006 18:05  BLOOD             CML-F:       186
 ==========================================================================
  
 The ranges now print as described in the solution to problem # 3.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 Test sites requested changes be made to the field descriptions to help the
 ADPACs better understand how values entered in the reference fields would
 effect the printing of the laboratory test definition in CPRS GUI and
 laboratory test with  results print outs. The changes were made to the
 following fields: (NOTE: all of these fields are sub-fields of field # 
 100, SITE/SPECIMEN)
  
 Number        Field Name
 ------        ----------
 1             REFERENCE LOW
 2             REFERENCE HIGH
 3             CRITICAL LOW
 4             CRITICAL HIGH
 9.2           THERAPEUTIC LOW
 9.3           THERAPEUTIC HIGH
