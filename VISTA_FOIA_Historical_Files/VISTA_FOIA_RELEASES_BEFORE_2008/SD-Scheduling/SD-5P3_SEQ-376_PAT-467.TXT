Subject: EWL OPEN MATCHED ENTRY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch enhances maintenance of the Electronic Wait List (EWL) and 
 addresses Remedy tickets reporting difficulties with dispositioned EWL 
 entries being repeatedly reopened. The following new features and
 modifications address these issues:
 1)  EWL entries will be automatically matched with appointments when they 
 are canceled by clinic decision (denoted by appointment status C:CANCELLED
 BY CLINIC or CA:CANCELLED BY CLINIC & AUTO RE-BOOK on the Patient file #2
 Appointment subfile #2.98 Status field #3), and the EWL entries will be
 updated in real-time.
 2)  The SD EWL BACKGROUND JOB has been modified to remove the cancelled
 appointment data from the opened EWL entry to prevent that entry from 
 being reopened if it is closed again with the same disposition code: 
 SA:REMOVED/SCHEDULED-ASSIGNED.
 3)  Appointments cancelled by clinic and rebooked will be available for 
 matching with EWL entries to close them again, if applicable.
 4)  A MailMan message will be sent to recipients in the SD EWL BACKGROUND 
 UPDATE mail group indicating that EWL entr(ies) were opened because of 
 cancelled appointment(s) with a listing of the patient(s), clinic(s), and 
 date/time(s) when the cancelled appointment(s) had been scheduled.
 5)  The $N function has been replaced with the $O function in routine 
 SDCNP1, which is invoked during appointment cancellation for a patient.
  
 This patch includes new prompts and informational messages that end users 
 need to understand when cancelling appointments. Detailed information can 
 be found in the Release Notes (see documentation section of this patch).
 All options that allow appointment cancellation are affected by this
 patch:
 - Appointment Management [SDAM APPT], when a patient or clinic is 
 selected and actions CA or MA are used to cancel appointments associated 
 with an EWL record or make appointments that force cancellation of an 
 existing appointment for the same date/time.
 - Make Appointment [SDM], after selecting a patient and clinic, and 
 entering a date/time for a new appointment, if the new appointment 
 date/time is the same as an existing appointment, and the new appointment 
 booking is completed.
 - Cancel Clinic Availability [SDCANCEL], when a block of appointments are 
 cancelled for a clinic.
 - Cancel Appointment [SD CANCEL APPOINTMENT], when appointments are 
 cancelled and optionally rebooked for a patient.
