Description:
============

 NOTE:
 ************************************************************************
 This patch does NOT conflict with CoreFLS and can be installed at CoreFLS
 sites.
 *************************************************************************
 This patch updates outdated Surgery/HL7 Interface protocols in the Protocol
 file (#101) and the files used for the Surgery Interface in the 
 HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870).

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 PROBLEM:
 ========
  
  The post-install instructions in patch SR*3.0*41 for setting up 
  the HL protocols/devices is no longer applicable with the 
  menu/option structure in HL package. Sites were unable to set up
  their Surgery/HL7 interfaces in the PROTOCOL file (#101) and the 
  HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870). 
    
  RESOLUTION:
  ===========
  Update the following Surgery protocols in the PROTOCOL file(#101) 
  and the files in the HL LOGICAL LINK file(#870) for the Surgery 
  interface to ensure that the ports are set correctly:
       
  HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870):
   SR AAIS
   SR SURGERY  
   
  The PROTOCOL file (#101) will be updated through a post install routine 
  SR122PST. This routine will ensure that the SENDING APPLICATION 
  field (770.1), RECEIVING APPLICATION field (770.2) and the LOGICAL
  LINK field (770.7) are set correctly. This routine will also set the 
  TIMESTAMP field (99) to the MUMPS date time for the install.  
  The records affected are:
    SR Notification of Appointment Booking
    SR Notification of Appointment Cancellation
    SR Notification of Appointment Deletion
    SR Notification of Appointment Modification
    SR Notification of Appointment Rescheduling
    SR Other Master File Notification 
    SR Query for Scheduling Information
    SR Receiver of Appointment Cancellation
    SR Receiver of Appointment Deletion
    SR Receiver of Appointment Modification
    SR Receiver of Appointment Rescheduling
    SR Receiver of Master File Notification
    SR Receiver of New Appointment Booking
    SR Receiver of Observation Unsolicited
    SR Receiver of Scheduling Query
    SR Receiver of Staff Master File Notification 
    SR Receiver of Unsolicited Requested Observation 
    SR Staff Master File Notification
    SR Unsolicited transmission of AAIS Requested Observation
    SR Unsolicited transmission of VistA Requested Observation

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
       INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
       for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
       NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
       in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
