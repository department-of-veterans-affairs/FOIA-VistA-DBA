Subject: DATA CLEANSING REPORTS FOR 6914 FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch exports a series of reports that will be used to prepare the
 data in the AEMS/MERS EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file for conversion to 
 the CoreFLS system.
    
 This patch adds a new menu option, Equipment Inventory - 6914 [ENH 
 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY], to the CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing Reports [ENH
 DATA CLEANSING] menu.  This menu option requires the security key ENH DATA
 CLEANSING and contains the following options:
     Compile Equipment Inventory List for Reports [ENH 6914 COMPILE]
     Summary Report [ENH 6914 SUMMARY REPORT] 
     Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6914 REQUIRED RPT]
     Lookup Fields w/ Invalid Data Report [ENH 6914 LOOKUP RPT]
     Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6914 NON-REQUIRED RPT]
    
  The reports examine the following 30 fields: 
    ENTRY NUMBER (#.01)
    MANUFACTURER (#1)
    PARENT SYSTEM (#2)
    MFGR. EQUIPMENT NAME (#3)
    MODEL (#4)
    SERIAL # (#5)
    EQUIPMENT CATEGORY (#6)
    TYPE OF ENTRY (#7)
    VENDOR POINTER (#10)
    TOTAL ASSET VALUE (#12)
    ACQUISITION SOURCE (#13.5)
    CATEGORY STOCK NUMBER (#18)
    CMR (#19)
    USE STATUS (#20)
    SERVICE POINTER (#21)
    LOCATION (#24)
    RESPONSIBLE SHOP (Multiple) (#6914.04,.01)
    TECHNICIAN (RESPONSIBLE SHOP Multiple) (#6914.04,1)
    STARTING MONTH (RESPONSIBLE SHOP Multiple) (#6914.04,2)
    CRITICALITY (RESPONSIBLE SHOP Multiple) (#6914.04,2.7)
    FREQUENCY (RESPONSIBLE SHOP/FREQUENCY Multiple) (#6914.43,.01)
    LEVEL (RESPONSIBLE SHOP/FREQUENCY Multiple) (#6914.43,3)
    PROCEDURE (RESPONSIBLE SHOP/FREQUENCY Multiple) (#6914.43,4)
    INVESTMENT CATEGORY (#34)
    STANDARD GENERAL LEDGER (#38)
    WORK PERFORMED (EQUIPMENT HISTORY Multiple) (#6914.02,9)
    STATION NUMBER (#60)
    BUDGET OBJECT CODE (#61)
    FUND (#62)
    ADMINISTRATION/OFFICE (#63)
  
 If any field is empty or has invalid data, it is included on one of the 
 reports.
  
 This patch includes four reports, one summary and three detailed:
  
  1.  Summary Report - lists all the fields examined and a count of how 
      many times each field is either empty or contains invalid data.
  
  2.  Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each
      required field in the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file that is empty.
      (A field is defined as required when the empty field causes
      functionality problems for CoreFLS.)
  
  3.  Lookup Fields with Invalid Data Report - lists each field in the
      EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file that contains invalid data.
  
  4.  Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each non-required
      field in the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file that is empty. Because
      the fields are not required, they may be left empty, but populating
      these fields with data will improve functionality after conversion 
      to CoreFLS.
