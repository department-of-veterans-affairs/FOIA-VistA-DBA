Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch will install the Progress Notes Report on the Dept. of Defense
  Reports menu on the Reports tab in CPRS, which is where the new DOD
  Health Assessment report will be available.  This report is only 
  available in Remote Data Views.  It will be available in v6 of VistAWeb.
  
  This patch is being released to support the DoD Pre and Post Deployment
  Health Assessments project.  The project is designed to display DoD Pre
  and Post Deployment Health Assessments from the Defense Medical
  Surveillance System (DMSS) database in the Veterans Health
  Information technology Architecture (VistA) Computerized Patient
  Record System (CPRS). It is the position of the Requestor and DoD
  counterparts that through this collaboration between VA and DoD,
  VA will be better positioned to evaluate health problems among service
  members and veterans after they leave the military service, to assess post
  deployment health questions, and to document changes in health status for
  disability determination.  All theater medical surveillance and treatment
  data collected by the data collected by the Services are being forwarded to
  DMSS.  The system includes data on immunizations and health events that
  occurred in theater as well as healthcare encounters and environmental
  exposures. The items in these assessments consist of a series of yes/no
  questions and a few free text questions.  They are filled out before and
  after all deployments lasting more than 30 days to a location that does not
  have a fixed medical treatment facility.  Once completed and signed by both
  the service member and the healthcare provider, one copy of the form is
  filed in the individual's medical record and the other is forwarded
  to DMSS.
  
  ROUTINE SUMMARY:
  ================
