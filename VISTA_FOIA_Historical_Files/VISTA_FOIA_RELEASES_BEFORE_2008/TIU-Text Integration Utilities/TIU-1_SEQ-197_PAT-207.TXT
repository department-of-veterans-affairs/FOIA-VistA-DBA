Subject: FIX HEADER, DISPLAY AND PROMPT ISSUES IN TIU REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix three issues found in the various options in VISTA
 List Manager to display TIU documents.
  
 Issue 1 - If the user chooses "Title" at the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt the 
 header will display that records where searched by "ALL CATEGORIES". This 
 needs to say TITLE instead of ALL CATEGORIES.
  
 Issue 2 - Users may choose more than 1 SEARCH CATEGORY. If they were to 
 choose a specific category (ex Title or Author) and choose the option 
 "All Categories", the header will then say "by TITLE and ALL CATEGORIES". 
 However, since a specific search category was selected this overrides 
 searching by All Categories. Therefore, the header should only list the 
 specific search categories.
  
 Issue 3 - There is a potential problem with the prompts in the following
 options discussed below.
 If there is only 1 Document Class under a chosen Class and you enter an
 "^" at the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt, it will appear that you can not exit
 out but instead, will take you back to the previous prompt.
 With this patch you will now go back 2 levels.
  
 This applies to the following menu options:
  
         Show Progress Notes Across Pat       TIU REVIEW PN CLINICIAN
         Multiple Patient Documents           TIU REVIEW SCREEN CLINICIAN

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 Problem 1:
 The header routine is using an array containing the cross references used 
 for the search to determine the Title in the Header section of the 
 screen. However, both the search by TITLE and the search by ALL 
 CATEGORIES use the same cross reference. Therefore, if the user chooses 
 to search by TITLE the header will say ALL CATEGORIES. 
  
 Resolution 1:
 Create an override flag when the user chooses their selection criteria. 
 This flag can then be used by the header routine to determine which value 
 it should include in the actual header.
  
 Problem 2:
 If the user selects a specific search criteria and choose to search by 
 ALL CATEGORIES the more specific criteria is what will be used. However, 
 the header will still display both criteria. This is misleading. 
  
 Resolution 2:
 Once the user has selected all of their search criteria the chosen 
 criteria will be evaluated for the above situation. If they have chosen 
 to search by both a specific criteria and the all categories criteria 
 then the "all categories" will be removed from the array holding the 
 search criteria. This will cause the header routine to display the true 
 search criteria.
  
 Problem 3:
 This problem can potentially show up on many menu options. To make the 
 explanation easier to understand the menu option TIU REVIEW DS CLINICIAN 
 will be used in this discussion.
  
 There is what appears to be a problem when running the TIU REVIEW DS 
 CLINICIAN menu option when there is only 1 Document Class under the 
 Discharge Summary Class. The first 3 prompts for this opion are:
         1) Select Status
         2) Select Discharge Summary Type  (if there is more than one 
            document class)
         3) Select SEARCH CATEGORIES.
 If there is only one Discharge Summary Type the routine will NOT display 
 a prompt and will move directly to the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt. Normally 
 the user may enter an "^" at any of the prompts to move back 1 level. In 
 this situation, however, if the user enters an "^" at the SEARCH 
 CATEGORIES prompt the routine will move back to the Discharge Summary 
 Type prompt which since there is only 1 choice will move automatically 
 back to the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt. This appears as if the user can not
 get out of the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt. 
  
 Resolution 3:
 Set a flag in the code so that if the above scenario occurs and the user 
 enters an "^" at the SEARCH CATEGORIES prompt they will then be taken 
 back 2 levels to the Status prompt.
