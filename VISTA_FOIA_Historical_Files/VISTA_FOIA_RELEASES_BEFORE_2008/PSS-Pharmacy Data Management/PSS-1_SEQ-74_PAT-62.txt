Subject: CREATE NEW CLINICAL REMINDERS INDEX GLOBAL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This project consists of 12 patches that work together to create a new
 Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
 rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
 finding types are included in the index.
  
 The 12 patches that comprise this project are:
  
  PXRM*1.5*12
  DG*5.3*478
  GMPL*2*27
  GMRV*4*15
  LR*5.2*295
  OR*3*157
  PSS*1*62
  PSJ*5*90
  PSO*7*118
  PX*1*119
  RA*5*33
  YS*5.01*77
  
 The purpose of this patch (PSS*1*62) is to lay the groundwork for these
 changes by creating a new cross-reference in the PHARMACY PATIENT file
 (#55) at both the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) and the IV multiple (#100).
 These are the new cross-references added to the PHARMACY PATIENT file
 (#55) and the fields used as the trigger-points.  The type of these
 cross-references is 'New', not 'Traditional'.
  
   X-ref  File/Sub-file                  Trigger-point field(s)

           /UNIT DOSE (#55.06)             START DATE/TIME (#10)
                                         ORDER NUMBER 2
                                           STOP DATE/TIME (#34)
  
   ACRIV  PHARMACY PATIENT (#55)         ORDER NUMBER 1
           /IV (#55.01)                    START DATE/TIME (#.02)
                                         ORDER NUMBER 2
                                           STOP DATE/TIME (#.03)
  
 This patch can be installed independently of the other patches. The 
 documentation describing the new functionality will be available when all 
 associated patches are released.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 1 minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*62):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*62.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
