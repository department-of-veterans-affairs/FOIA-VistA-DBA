 Installation Instructions
 =========================
 It is recommended to install the patch during AFTER business hours to 
 minimize impact to the user. 
  
 DG53244U is one of the post-installation routines for previously 
 released patch DG*5.3*244, which had a Compliance Date of Jun 23, 2003. 
 DG53244U is updated by DG*5.3*620 just in case that any site would still
 need this routine as part of the installation of DG*5.3*244. If before the
 installation of DG*5.3*620, your site has already deleted DG53244U as 
 instructed by DG*5.3*244, please delete DG53244U after the installation of
 DG*5.3*620. DG53244U serves for DG*5.3*244, not DG*5.3*620. 
  
 The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
     patch text only.] 
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*620):
  
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*620.
  
  7.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//", respond NO.
  
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
  9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 10.  Delete the post install routines DG53620* after successful patch
      Installation.
  
 11.  If before the installation of DG*5.3*620, DG53244U is already deleted
      as instructed by DG*5.3*244, or if DG53244U is no longer needed at
      your site, you may delete DG53244U as well.
