Subject: PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION HOLIDAY

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the software so it will maintain a history of 
 non-recurring holidays instead of just the most recent one.  This patch
 also modifies the software to recognize Thursday, January 20, 2005 as a
 holiday for sites that have a majority of their employees working in the
 Washington DC area.  This patch should be installed at all sites, but the
 Presidential Inauguration Day holiday will only be set at specific sites.
  
 The modifications made by this patch are described in more detail below:
  
 1. Enhance how non-recurring holidays are handled.
  
    The PAID package only remembers the most recent non-recurring holiday 
    that was added by a patch to the software.  This patch enhances the
    software so it will retain information on earlier non-recurring
    holidays that were added by a prior patch.  The Monthly Calendar [PRS
    MONTH CALENDAR] option can be used to verify holidays that are known by
    the system.  The software has also been enhanced to make it easier to
    add future non-recurring holidays. The list of non-recurring holidays
    that are recognized by the software follows:
  
    Date       Holiday                    Day of Week   Related Patch
    --------   ------------------------   -----------   -------------
     4/27/94   President Nixon Funeral    WEDNESDAY     PRS*3.1*2
    12/26/97   Extra Christmas Day        FRIDAY        PRS*4*33
    12/24/01   Extra Christmas Day        MONDAY        PRS*4*72
    12/26/03   Extra Christmas Day        FRIDAY        PRS*4*88
    06/11/04   President Reagan Funeral   FRIDAY        PRS*4*94
  
  
 2. Establish 1/20/05 as a holiday for DC area sites
  
    Due to Office of Personnel regulations, all federal employees employed
    in the District of Columbia, Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in
    Maryland; Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia; and the cities of
    Alexandria and Falls Church in Virginia will be given a federal holiday
    for Presidential Inauguration Day. Office of Personnel regulations 
    reference indicates that Thursday, January 20, 2005 is to be treated as
    a holiday for pay entitlement purposes.
  
    This patch updates the PAID package so the following VistA systems will
    recognize Thursday, January 20, 2005 as a holiday.
  
    Station   VistA System
    Number
    -------   ----------------------------
    101       VA Central Office
    688       Washington VA Medical Center
  
  
    Other VistA systems will not automatically recognize this day as a
    holiday for all employees.  However, the Set Holiday Benefit Day [PRSA
    TK EMP-HOL] option can be used by payroll to specify a holiday for
    selected employees.  Sites that have some (but not a majority) of
    employees working in the DC area will need to use this option to set
    January 20, 2005 (or an appropriate 'in lieu of' day) as a holiday for
    applicable employees.
  
    ********************************************************************
    * WARNING: The Set Holiday Benefit Day [PRSA TK EMP-HOL] option    *
    * must not be used on 1/17/05 to set the Presidential Inauguration *
    * Day for an employee because the software will move the           *
    * Martin Luther King holiday instead of adding the Presidential    *
    * Inauguration Day holiday.                                        *
    ********************************************************************
