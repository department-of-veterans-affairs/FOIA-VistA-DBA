Description: 
============

 This patch contains enhancements to the ASISTS package to implement the 
 requirements for the Needlestick Act (HR 5178).  In addition to adding new 
 fields to ASISTS, modifications are being made to the Edit Report of 
 Incident and Log of Needlestick Incidents Options.  All of the new fields 
 (except Service) will be transmitted to the ASISTS National Database using 
 the existing option.  Changes are also being made to the transmission of 
 data to the ASISTS National Database.  The log of needlestick Incidents 
 report has also been modified to display the new Needlestick Act information.
  
 In addition to these enhancements the following NOIS and E3R's will be 
 addressed:
  
 NOIS:
 -----
 DUB-0200-30806 - LOG Scrolling off screen
 DAY-0300-40493 - Problem in OOPS*1*9 patch (queued reports)
 FAV-0501-72555 - ENTERING NEW UNION INFO FOR W.C.
 SBY-0501-31651 - DATE OF INJURY DOESN'T SHOW UNDER DISPLAY
  
 E3R's:
 ------
 11860 - ADD SERVICE FIELD
 12320 - SERVICE NAME / MAIL SYMBOL
 12418 - ASISTS REPORTS
 14511 - LOG OF FEDERAL INJURIES PRINT TO SCREEN
 14736 - DATE RANGE FOR LOG OPTIONS
   
 1.  Modifications to the Edit Report of Incident Option [OOPS SAFETY SUP
     ENTRY], [OOPS SUP ENTRY]
 
 Modifications have been made to the 2162 portion of the Edit Report of  
 Incident Option [OOPS SAFETY SUP ENTRY], [OOPS SUP ENTRY] on the Safety, 
 Supervisor, and Workers' Comp menus.  These modifications allow for 
 collecting data in the new fields added to the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
 FILE (#2260) (see item 2 below).
  
 If the TYPE OF INCIDENT field (#3) in the ASISTS Accident Reporting File 
 (#2260) equals either Sharps Exposure, Hollow Bore Needlestick, or Suture 
 Needlestick then the user is prompted to enter the BRAND (#82) of the 
 device.  BRAND is a pointer to a new file, ASISTS NEEDLESTICK BRANDS File 
 (#2262.3) that can be updated as needed by the user.
  
 DEVICE SIZE (#83) is a new field whose entry is dependant on the OBJECT 
 CAUSING INJURY field (#38).  The OBJECT CAUSING INJURY field (#38) uses 
 (is a pointer to) the ASISTS DEVICE/EQUIPMENT File (#2261.7).  If the 
 response to the OBJECT CAUSING INJURY (#38) prompt points to an entry in the 
 ASISTS DEVICE/EQUIPMENT File (#2261.7) whose TYPE field (#2) equals an 'N' 
 for Needlestick, then the user is prompted to enter the DEVICE SIZE (#83).  
 If the TYPE Field (#2) equals an 'S', the DEVICE SIZE prompt is not asked.  
 Additionally, if the description for the OBJECT CAUSING INJURY field (#38), 
 contains the word Needle, a listing of valid Needle sizes will be available 
 for selection.  If the description contains the word Syringe, a listing of 
 valid Syringe gauges will be available. 
  
 The SAFETY DESIGN DEVICE USED Field (#43) set of codes has been changed.  
 Unknown is no longer a valid selection.  Additionally, if the user enters a 
 'Y' in this field now, they will be prompted to enter two new fields.  The 
 first field is DID THE INJURY OCCUR BEFORE THE SAFETY DEVICE WAS ENGAGED 
 (#87) and has a Yes/No response.  The second new field, SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS 
 (#84) points to a new ASISTS Table File, ASISTS SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS 
 (#2261.9).  If the user enters a 'N' in the SAFETY DESIGN DEVICE USED field 
 (#43), they will be prompted to reply to the new free text field, EXPLAIN WHY 
 A SAFETY DEVICE WAS NOT USED field (#85).
  
 The new fields noted above must be completed before the Supervisor can sign 
 the 2162 form.
  
 In addition, the SERVICE (#86) field has been added and is 'pulled' 
 automatically from the New Person File (#200), SERVICE/SECTION field (#29). 
 This occurs in the Edit Report of Incident option.
  
  
 2.  New fields have been added to the ASISTS Accident Reporting File 
     (#2260).
  
 The following fields have been added to the ASISTS Accident Reporting 
 File (#2260) (field numbers are shown to right of field name):
  
   BRAND (#82)
   DEVICE SIZE (#83)
   SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS (#84)
   SAFETY DEVICE NOT USED (#85)
   SERVICE (#86)
   INJ PRIOR TO SAFE DEV ENGAGED (#87)
   NEEDS XMIT TO NDB (#54) 
   TRANSMITTED TO NDB (#59)
 
   
 3.  The Print Report of Accident [OOPS SAFETY PRINT], [OOPS SUP PRINT], 
     [OOPS UNION PRINT] has been modified.
  
 The Print Report of Accident has been modified to display the new fields 
 listed in item #2 above..
  
  
 4.  The routines that extract and transmit data to the ASISTS National 
 Database have been modified to include sending the new fields: BRAND 
 (#82), DEVICE SIZE (#83), SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS (#84), SAFETY DEVICE NOT 
 USED (#85) and the INJ PRIOR TO SAFE DEV ENGAGED (#87).
 In addition to sending these new fields, the routines have been altered to
 allow data to be sent daily versus the original design of only once a
 month.  In order to do this, the Scheduled Transmit National Database (2162)
 Data [OOPS SCHEDULED XMIT 2162 DATA] should be scheduled to run once a day
 (business days), 8 hours after the close of normal business hours. The IRM
 or designated group or the facility should schedule this.  Along with this
 update, the Manual Transmit of National Database (2162) Data,
 [OOPS MANUAL 2162 DATA XMIT] can now ONLY be used to re-transmit data that
 was previously sent to NDB.  This includes both cases successfully sent and
 cases that failed during the transmit process.  This is a change from the
 current processing where any case could be selected for manual transmission. 
  
  
 5.  Three new ASISTS files have been added.
  
 The following table files have been added to ASISTS:  ASISTS DEVICE 
 SIZE File (#2262.2), the ASISTS SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS File (#2261.9), and 
 the ASISTS NEEDLESTICK BRANDS File (#2262.3).  These files will be used as 
 valid responses to the DEVICE SIZE (#83), SAFETY CHARACTERISTICS (#84) and 
 the BRAND (#82) fields in the ASISTS Accident Reporting File (#2260) .
  
  
 6.  A pre-installation routine will be run that will convert the value of 
 the SAFETY DESIGN DEVICE USED (#43) field in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING 
 File (#2260) if it equals 'U'nknown to 'N'o.  This change is made at the 
 direction of TAG in order to support the new logic for this field as 
 described in item 1 above.
  
  
 7.  The Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses [OOPS LOG] and
     Log of Needlestick Incidents [OOPS NEEDLESTICK LOG] which can be 
     accessed from the ASISTS Employee Health Menu [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU], 
     the ASISTS Safety Officers Menu [OOPS SAFETY MENU], and the ASISTS Union
     Menu [OOPS UNION MENU] have been modified.
  
 Both reports will now accept date ranges for the report information 
 selection criteria.  The new Needlestick Act (HR 5178) information, from 
 the ASISTS Accident Reporting File (#2260) are now included in the 
 report information. 
  
 In addition to the above information being displayed, NOIS DUB-0200-30806
 is also resolved by fixing a bug in the code that prints/lists report data
 to the terminal. 
  
  
 8.  The Print Accident Report Status report which can be accessed from
     ASISTS Employee Health Menu [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU], ASISTS Supervisor 
     Menu [OOPS SUP MENU], ASISTS Safety Officers Menu [OOPS SAFETY MENU],
     ASISTS Union Menu [OOPS UNION MENU], and ASISTS Worker's Compensation
     Menu [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU] has been modified.
  
 NOIS DAY-0300-40493 has been resolved by fixing a bug in the code that was
 erroneously reporting that no data was found for queued reports containing
 valid data. 
  
  
 9.  The Display CA1 or CA2 Option which can be accessed from ASISTS Employee
     Health Menu [OOPS EMP HEALTH MENU], ASISTS Supervisor Menu [OOPS SUP
     MENU], ASISTS Safety Officers Menu [OOPS SAFETY MENU], and ASISTS
     Worker's Compensation Menu [OOPS WORKER'S COMP MENU] has been modified
     to correct NOIS SBY-0501-31651.  The DATE OF INJURY field 
     (#141) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260) from the 
     Supervisors' portion of the CA1 was not displaying the date.  With the 
     modification, the date now displays correctly.
  
  
 10. The Edit Site Parameter Option [OOPS EDIT SITE PARAMETER] has been
 modified by adding a new field, OWCP CHARGEBACK CODE (.7) to the subfile, 
 STATION (#2262.03) of the ASISTS SITE PARAMETER File (#2262).  This field 
 will be used as the default value for the OWCP CHARGEBACK CODE field (#70) 
 in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260) entered in the Workers' 
 Compensation Edit CA1/CA2 [OOPS WC EDIT CA1/CA2] Option.  This field can be 
 left blank if a default value is not desired.  The prompt, OWCP AGENCY CODE 
 field (#1) in the ASISTS SITE PARAMETER File (#2262) has been removed as it 
 is no longer used in ASISTS.
  
 
 11. The Print CA1/CA2 Option [OOPS EMP PRINT CA], [OOPS SUP PRINT CA], 
     and [OOPS SAFETY PRINT CA] has been modified to print the DATE/TIME 
     INJURY OCCURRED field (#109) entered by the employee in block 10 on 
     the CA1 instead of the DATE/TIME OF OCCURRENCE field (#4) from the 
     ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING FILE (#2260).
  
  
 12. The Workers' Compensation Edit CA1/CA2 [OOPS WC EDIT CA1/CA2] Option 
     has been modified to use the OWCP CHARGEBACK CODE field (#.7) from the 
     ASISTS SITE PARAMETER FILE (#2262) subfile STATION (#2262.03) as the
     default value for the OWCP CHARGEBACK CODE field (#70) in the ASISTS
     ACCIDENT REPORTING FILE (#2260).
  
  
 13. Additional error checking has been added to the SSN field (#5) in the 
     ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING FILE (#2260) to prevent entry of all zero's.   
     This is necessary to use the SSN as a unique identifier in the ASIST 
     National Database.
  
   
 14. Removed the date error checking the DATE FIRST AWARE OF ILLNESS field 
     (#214) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260) that prevented 
     this date being greater than 3 years in the past.  Additional date 
     error checking has been implemented on fields DATE FIRST REALIZED CAUSE 
     (#215), FIRST DATE MEDICAL CARE (#250), DATE NOTICE RECEIVED (#252), 
     DATE/TIME WORK STOPPED (#253), and DATE OF LAST EXPOSURE (#255) in the 
     ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING File (#2260) so that these dates cannot be 
     prior to the DATE FIRST AWARE OF ILLNESS (#214).  Note that the DATE 
     1ST AWARE OF ILLNESS in the Create Accident/Illness Record [OOPS CREATE 
     CASE] cannot be greater than three years in the past.
  
   
 15. Modifications have been made to routines OOPSDOL1, OOPSDOL2 and 
     OOPSDOLX to implement corrections of minor problems in the data 
     extraction and transmission of claims data to the Department of Labor.
  
  
 16. Made a modification to Enter/Edit Union Information Option [OOPS WC 
     EDIT UNION INFO] to correct a problem with adding new records.  This 
     addresses NOIS FAV-0501-72555.
