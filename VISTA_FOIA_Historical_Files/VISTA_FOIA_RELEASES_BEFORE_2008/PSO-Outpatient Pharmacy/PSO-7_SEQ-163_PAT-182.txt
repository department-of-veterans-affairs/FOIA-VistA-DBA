Description:
============

 WPB-0304-31149
 Problem: When a partial is processed for a ScripTalk patient, the
 ScripTalk label generated prints with the full quantity instead of
 the partial quantity.
  
 Solution: This issue is resolved with this patch.
  
 CLE-0304-40723
 Problem: For a ScripTalk patient, the sig is truncated on the 
 label if the sig is greater than 196 characters.
  
 Solution: For a Scriptalk patient, if the sig is greater than 196 characters
 when the label is printed, the human readable section will print in
 English and its Spanish translation will print as follows:
  
 "SIG IS TOO LONG. REPRINT A NON-VOIDED VISTA LABEL AND PLACE OVER THIS
 SCRIPTALK LABEL"
  
 "INDICACIONES MUY LARGAS. IMPRIMA UNA ETIQUETA DE VISTA VALIDA Y APLIQUELA
 SOBRE ESTA ETIQUETA DE SCRIPTALK EN LA BOTELLA."
  
 HIN-0104-41546
 Problem: When using ScripTalk Patient Enter/Edit [PSO SCRIPTALK PATIENT
 ENROLL] option, the message displayed is offset and incomplete.
  
 Solution: The full message will be displayed after the installation of
 this patch.
  
 BIG-0404-70352
 Problem:
 1. When a patient has more than one eligibility code defined and the patient
    profile is accessed using the [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, it only
    displays one eligibility. 
 2. When the patient status is not defined, and the patient is accessed, it only
    displays one eligibility. 
  
 Solution: Multiple eligibilities defined for the patient will be displayed
 after the installation of this patch.

  Server Installation Instructions:
  =================================
  
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
  
  Installation will take about 5 minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
       be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*182)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*182
  
    6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//" respond NO.
  
    7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
    8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
