Subject: DATA UPDATE CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
 Not all the data elements entered for patch PSN*4*79 were transmitted
 to the sites.  This patch corrects that deficiency.  It also corrects the
 interaction problem reported in NOIS HWH-0204-41872 and the matching
 problem reported in NOIS PTH-0204-21559 and TUA-0204-30133.
  
 This patch generates three mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
 and are sent to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the
 PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  The first
 message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products,
 CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs.  The second,
 with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists interactions that
 have been added, edited, or inactivated.  The third, with the subject
 MISSING INTERACTIONS, lists items that were added in patch PSN*4*79
 for which an interaction warning should have been triggered but was not.
 It also lists the interactions.  The message with the subject
 DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE is not generated by this patch
 since none of the data elements in this patch cause entries in the 
 DRUG file (#50) to be unmatched from NDF.
  
 This patch also creates ^XTMP("PSNINT") that contains a list of
 combinations of products that should have generated an interaction
 warning but did not.  The size of ^XTMP("PSNINT) is about 120 DSM blocks.
  
 A subsequent patch will be created which will use data in ^XTMP to generate
 lists of patients who had received combinations of orders which should
 have caused an interaction warning but did not.
  
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
