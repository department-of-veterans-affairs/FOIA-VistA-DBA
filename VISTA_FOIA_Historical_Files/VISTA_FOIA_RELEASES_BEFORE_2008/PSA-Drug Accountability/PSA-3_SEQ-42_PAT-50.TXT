Subject: UNDEFINED ERROR IN PSAPROC1 AND FALSE PROCESSING MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problems:
    
 1. HD 68113 Invoice select prompt (1-0)
  
 The software is not properly detecting when all invoices being worked 
 with have been processed. It is asking the user to make a selection when 
 there are no invoices left to select from. The software errors out with 
 an undefined if the user continues.
  
 2. HD 93067 A faulty message 'The invoice has not been placed in a 
 Processed status!' is presented.
  
 Processing invoices currently does not evaluate the status of the invoice
 being processed and displays an inaccurate message at the end of processing.
  
 3. HD 91604 An undefined error occurs when the selection list of invoices 
 to send on to verification has a missed node in the display numbering 
 sequence of the invoices. The user is able to put in a range from the 
 beginning of the list to the last number in the list and the processing 
 tries to work on all numbers in between. It hits the number of the 
 missing node and it breaks.

 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==================== 
  
 1. HD 68113 Invoice select prompt (1-0)
 PROBLEM:
 ======== 
 The software is not properly detecting when all invoices being worked 
 with have been processed. It is asking the user to make a selection when 
 there are no invoices left to select from. The software errors out with 
 an undefined if the user continues.
 RESOLUTION:
 ===========
 Two variables exists that do present the count of invoices left to be 
 processed. Tests for both of those variables have been coded and the 
 software will bypass the inappropriate prompts.
 TECHNICAL:
 ========== 
 Routine PSAPROC2 has been modified to test for the variable that holds 
 the count of invoices left to process. If there are none it skips the 
 inappropriate prompts for further editing/processing and the subsequent 
 prompt for selection of invoices.
  
 2. HD 93607 A faulty message 'The invoice has not been placed in a 
 Processed status!' is presented.
 PROBLEM:
 ======== 
 Processing invoices currently does not evaluate the status of the invoice
 being processed and displays an inaccurate message at the end of processing.
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The processing application has been modified to correctly 
 evaluate the status of the invoice before displaying the end of 
 processing message.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ========== 
 The routine PSAPROC1 has added code that restores the processed condition 
 logic state prior to testing for whether the 'not processed ' message 
 needs to be printed.
  
 3. HD 91604 An undefined error occurs when the selection list of invoices 
 to send on to verification has a missed node in the display numbering 
 sequence of the invoices. 
 PROBLEM:
 ======== 
 The user is able to put in a range from the beginning of the list to the 
 last number in the list and the processing tries to work on all numbers 
 in between. It hits the number of the missing node and it breaks.
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 Protective code has been inserted to detect that a node in the array 
 listing invoices is missing and it skips that number if it is not present.
 TECHNICAL:
 The routine PSAPROC1 has been modified with a 'I '$D(PSAOK(PSA)) Q' 
 statement to skip any missing nodes in the listing of invoices ready for 
 processing to verification.
