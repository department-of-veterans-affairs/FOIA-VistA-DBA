 Installation: 
 ============
   
   1.   You will need to disable mapping of any routines within the
        %ZOSVK* namespace.
         
   2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
         
   3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
        options: 
         
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global 
         
    4.  You do not need to inhibit users from login into the system.  
         
    5.  Ensure that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is
        not currently running by using the 'Status of SAGG Collection 
        Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] option and verifying the following 
        message is displayed: 
         
        The temporary collection global (i.e., ^XTMP("KMPS")) has no data.
  
         
    6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install
        Package(s)' option and select the package 
   
           XU*8.0*197 
           ==========         
         
    7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.  
         
    8.  OpenM-NT (Cache) sites - you do not need to move any routines, skip
        this step.  
         
        DSM sites - you need to move several routines from your production 
        account to manager account.  
        
           ZOSVKSD
           ZOSVKSOE 
           ZOSVKSOS 
           ZOSVKSVE 
           ZOSVKSVS 
         
    9.  OpenM-NT (Cache) sites remain in VAH.  
         
        DSM sites remain in the manager account.  
         
        All sites: 
         
           DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET 
           Select the System 
           Patch number to load: 197 
                                 ===
  
   10.  After patch has installed, rebuild your map set if necessary.
