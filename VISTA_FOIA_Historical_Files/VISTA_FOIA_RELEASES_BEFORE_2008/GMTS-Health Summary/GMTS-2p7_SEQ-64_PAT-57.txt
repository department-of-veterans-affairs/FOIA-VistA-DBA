Associated patches: (v)GMTS*2.7*37 <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMTS*2.7*57'

Subject: SURGERY DATA EXTRACTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  This patch changes the data extraction routines for 4 of the 5 Surgery 
  Health Summary Components.  After installing SR*3.0*100, these components
  will call HS^SROGMTS.  This new data extraction routine supports new data
  structures, storage in the Text Integration Utility (TIU), and electronic
  signatures. (routines involved are GMTSRO, GMTSROB, GMTSROE, and GMTSRON)
  
  NOTE!!!
  =======
 After installing this patch, only surgery documents stored in the TIU 
 DOCUMENT file (8925) will be visible in the surgery Health Summary 
 Components listed below.
  
 Surgery Patch SR*3.0*100 contains a process for converting surgery reports
 from the surgery files into TIU Documents so that they are viewable on the
 Surgery tab in CPRS. Any surgery documents that remain in the surgery
 files (130) will not be visible in these Components. If the documents for 
 a Surgery case have not been made viewable in CPRS, the Health Summary
 component will no longer display surgery information for the case.

  The following Surgery Component did not change after the installation
  of SR*3.0*100:
    
     SURGERY REPORTS BRIEF                                       BSR
             Print Routine:  ENSR^GMTSROB
             Data Extract:   WRT^GMTSROB        Pre SR*3.0*100
                             WRT^GMTSROB        No Change
  
  In addition to adding the new data extraction routine, these routines have
  been edited to document existing DBIAs, and in some cases, modified to 
  comply with existing DBIAs.  One new DBIA between Health Summary and the
  Surgery Packages was created (#3590 - Health Summary Surgical Extract).

     should take less than 1 minute.
           
     1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
         load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
          
     2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the Routine
         Summary above, then they should be removed from the mapped set
         at this time.
   
     3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
         select the Installation menu.
              
     4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
         options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMTS*2.7*57):
            
           a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           b.  Print Transport Global
           c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           d.  Backup a Transport Global
        
     5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
         GMTS*2.7*57.
         
     6.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO."
          
     7.  If any of the routines listed in the Routine Summary were
         unmapped as part of step 2 above, then they should be returned
         to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
     8.  Clean up:  None.
