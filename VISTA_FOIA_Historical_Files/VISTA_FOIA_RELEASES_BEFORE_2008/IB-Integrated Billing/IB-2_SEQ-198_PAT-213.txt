  NOIS OVERVIEW: 
  ==============
  1.  OKL-0303-72052     R0SC REPORT NEEDED IN IB 
   
   Problem: 
   --------
   The existing R0SS report contained combined information coming back from 
   WebMD and from the payer.  This could lead to confusion when reading the 
   report and possibly some error messages could be missed or misinterpreted.
   The report titles on the Electronic Report Disposition menu were not 
   very informative as to the content of each report.  
    
   Resolution: 
   -----------
   The Austin Automation Center will begin to split the two types of messages 
   previously contained in the R0SS report.  
   The WebMD edits will continue to show up on the R0SS report and a new R0SC 
   report will contain the payer edits.  The old report will continue to be 
   sent until approximately 30 days after this patch is released.  This will 
   allow time for all sites to install the patch and be ready to receive the 
   new report.  The default disposition value for the new report will be 
   MAIL REPORT TO MAIL GROUP.  The R0SC report will be mailed to the IB EDI 
   mail group as are the other reports that are flagged to be mailed.  
   In addition to the new report, several of the reports have been renamed on 
   the Electronic Report Disposition menu to more closely reflect the data 
   contained in the report.  The name changes are as follows: 
   
    Report  Old Name                           New Name

   TECHNICAL: 
  ==========
  1.  OKL-0303-72052     R0SC REPORT NEEDED IN IB 
   
   a.  A new record is added to the IB ELECTRONIC REPORT DISPOSITION file 
       (#361.2).  The new entry will look like this: 
       ^IBE(361.2,nn,0) = R0SC^1^PROF. GOV'T PAYER EDITS 
   b.  The .03 field, SHORT DESCRIPTION, in file #361.2 is updated for 6 
       existing reports. (See Problem Resolution above for the changes.) 
   c.  The ListMan template IBCE ELEC REPORT DISP is modified to separate 
       the Description column from the Disposition column by 2 characters 
       so that the text does not run together and the text area is 
       increased by one line to accommodate the new report entry.  
       Description moved left from column 18 to 17.  
       Disposition moved right from column 48 to 49.  
       Bottom margin moved down from row 18 to 19.
