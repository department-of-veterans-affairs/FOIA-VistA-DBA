Description:
============

   **********************************************************************
    WARNING - Prior to installing this patch please check for local Class
    III modifications that may be overwritten upon installation. Failure
    to reinstall Class III modifications after installation of this patch
    may prevent the Class III changes from functioning properly.
   **********************************************************************
  
  1. When finishing a CPRS-entered order for a syringe, if the user
     indicates "NO" at the intermittent syringe prompt, the syringe 
     size field is required and causes a loop back to the patient's
     profile if it is not filled in.  This patch will allow the user
     to "carriage return" past the SYRINGE SIZE prompt and continue
     finishing the order.
  
  2. Currently when field "(12) Dispense Drug" of an order is edited an
     updated picklist is not triggered.  This change will cause an update
     trigger to the picklist.
