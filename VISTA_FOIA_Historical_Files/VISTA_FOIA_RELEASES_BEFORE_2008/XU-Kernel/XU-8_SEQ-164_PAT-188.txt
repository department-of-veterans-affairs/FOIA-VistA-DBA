Description: 
============

 This patch fixes a problem from patch XU*8*177.  CPRS users noticed a 
 slowdown after installing XU*8*177.  This patch will correct the slowdown.  
 Additionally, an invalid line tag was mistakenly called while the menu's 
 are being rebuilt.  The line tag call has been removed.  This problem was 
 reported in NOIS MAC-0101-60511.  Other NOIS's that reference the same 
 problem and used as test sites:

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
      1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
      installation.
  
      2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
      3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution 
      System) package onto your system.
     
      4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
      5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options: 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
  
            Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":
            Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                =======
             Install Package(s) 
             Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*188
                                  ==========
         Logons do not need to be inhibited.
         No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                         ==
  
      6.  AXP Sites - Answer 'NO' to the question 'Want to MOVE 
      routines to other CPUs?'.
  
      7.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
