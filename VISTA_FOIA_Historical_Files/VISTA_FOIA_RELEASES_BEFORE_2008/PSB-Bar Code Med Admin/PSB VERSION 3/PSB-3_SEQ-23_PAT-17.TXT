Subject: PROBLEM WITH MED HISTORY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  1.  Problem: REMEDY: HD 68763 / NOIS: ERI-0205-20313
      When a Medication History Report is run on a particular 
      medication ordered for a patient, the report should display every 
      instance of the additive found in the selected medication 
      administered and every instance that any medication containing 
      the solution found in the selected medication was administered. 
      There are two issues with the Medication History report corrected 
      with this patch.
  
      Issue 1:  The report occasionally displays medications other
      than the medication chosen by the user and sometimes it contains a
      medication that the patient had never received.
  
      Issue 2:  The users found that for patients who have had 
      an extensive number of medication administrations, the report 
      randomly lists too many medications and is very difficult to 
      read.
    
      Corrective action:
      The Medication History Report process was modified so that it will 
      no longer display invalid medications as stated above in issue 1, and
      the confusing format of the report, as stated in issue 2, will be 
      changed so that the additives and solutions will be separated into
      two sections.  The first section of the report will contain a new
      title in the header labeled, "SEARCH FOR ADDITIVE:", followed by 
      the Additive found in the selected medication.  The body of this 
      section of the report will display every instance that any 
      medication containing the additive listed in the header was
      administered during a specific date range chosen by the user.
      The second section of this report will also contain a new
      title in the header labeled, "SEARCH FOR SOLUTION:", followed by the
      name of the solution found in the selected medication.  The body of
      this section of the report will display all instances that any
      medication containing the solution listed in the header was
      administered during a selected date range.
 
      This report is printed in CPRS by selecting the "Meds" tab, choosing
      the order, and using the right click mouse options to select 
      "Administration History".  It can also be printed in CPRS by 
      selecting the "Orders" tab, choosing the order, and using the right 
      click mouse options to select "Details"
 
      ******************************************************************
      * Please be aware that if a hyperal type of IV is ordered, the   *
      * additive search is not displayed in either of the above CPRS   *
      * searches.  This issue will be addressed in a later CPRS patch. *
      ******************************************************************
 
      This report is printed in BCMA by choosing the order and using the 
      right click mouse options to select "Med History".
