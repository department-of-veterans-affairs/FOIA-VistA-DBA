Description: 
============

 **WARNING**  ANY SITE USING THE MARK SENSE SCANNING SOFTWARE (PANDAS) OR
 THE TELEFORM SOFTWARE, OR ANY SITE WHO HAS MADE LOCAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE
 PACKAGE INTERFACE FILE NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT THIS PATCH WILL
 MODIFY/DELETE SPECIFIC DATA ELEMENTS. PLEASE REFER TO ITEMS #1-4 BELOW IN
 THE PATCH DESCRIPTION FOR MORE DETAIL.
  
 The AICS Package Interface file (357.6) contains data that is used during
 the design of encounter forms and in the formatting of data to be sent to
 PCE.  Some problems in this data have been caused by some early usage of
 this file in supporting early data entry projects such as the PANDAS
 scanning project.  Other sites may experience the same problem when
 importing forms prepared by another site.  Generally, sites are unaware of
 the problems caused by these database inconsistencies until they use
 scanning or AICS Manual Data Entry and PCE reports some problems in
 receiving the data.
  
 This patch contains a 4-part database check that is run upon installation
 and after the use of the Import/Export utility to import any form or
 block. This check restores the data in the AICS Data Qualifiers file and
 the Package Interface file to the values of the initial release.  No
 locally added entries are modified.  The 4 parts of the check are:
  
    1.  The Code field (#.02) of the AICS Data Qualifiers file (357.98) is
        checked for all entries.  The value of this field is used as a
        value when sending data to PCE using the Device Interface Module.
        Invalid entries have their names changed so that they are prefaced
        with "ZZBAD".
  
    2.  The Package Interface file (357.6) is then updated.  First, the
        Allowable Qualifiers field (#13) is updated to only allow those
        qualifiers that are appropriate for the entry.  Then, the fields
        that define the formatting of data to send to PCE using the Device
        Interface Module are updated.
  
    3.  If any qualifiers with the name beginning with "ZZBAD" are found,
        the Data Qualifier field (#.09) within the Subcolumn Number field
        (#2) multiple in the Selection List file (357.2) is updated to the
        correct qualifier.
  
    4.  The entries in the Package Interface file (357.6) that use "PROBLEM" 
        in the PCE DIM NODE field (#12.01) are found. These entries will be
        reported but will need to be manually corrected.  Please contact
        National VISTA Support for assistance.
  
  
 The following is a sample of the database check output.
  
 >>> Now checking the AICS DATA QUALIFIERS file for inappropriate entries.
  
  >> Summary of the AICS Data Qualifiers Check:
     The number of changes made was 2
     The Entry ACTIVE^1^1 changed to ZZBAD-ACTIVE^A^A
        and was used by Package File entry INPUT DIAGNOSIS CODE (ICD9)
     The Entry INACTIVE^0^0 changed to ZZBAD-INACTIVE^I^I
        and was used by Package File entry INPUT DIAGNOSIS CODE (ICD9)
  
  >> Done updating the AICS DATA QUALIFIERS file
  
   
 >>> Now checking the PACKAGE INTERFACE file for inappropriate data
 qualifiers.
  
     The Package Interface INPUT DIAGNOSIS CODE (ICD9) had: 
        an invalid qualifier of ZZBAD-ACTIVE deleted.
        an invalid qualifier of ZZBAD-INACTIVE deleted.
  
  >> Summary of the Package Interface Check:
     A total of 2 qualifiers were removed from Package Interface Entries.
   
 >>> Now checking the SELECTION LIST file for inappropriate Data
 Qualifiers.
  
  >> Summary of Selection List Check:
  
  >> A total of 486 selection lists were checked.
     No problems were found.
 >>> Now uncompiling all Encounter Forms.
     Okay, forms will be recompiled as they are printed.
