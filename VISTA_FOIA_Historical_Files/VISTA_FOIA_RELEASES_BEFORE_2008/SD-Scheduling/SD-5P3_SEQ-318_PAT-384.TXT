 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some
 options will be out of service during the installation process it is
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take 
 less than 5 minutes.  See the steps below to disable the following options:
 
                     1. SDM                 Make Appointment
                     2. SDAM APPT MGT       Appointment Management
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload the KIDS
    distribution included with this message.
 
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
       
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*384)
     
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
 
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*384.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES// answer 'NO' (Unless otherwise indicated).
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES // YES  
 
 8. When prompted to select the options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
    Order', enter:
 
     SDM                 Make Appointment
     SDAM APPT MGT       Appointment Management
 
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation 
    has run to completion.
