Subject: PROBLEM WITH ENTERING A C&P EXAM REQUEST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When entering patient information using the Enter a C&P Exam Request
 [DVBA C ENTER C&P REQUEST] option, a problem occurs if the user enters an
 up-arrow, "^", at certains points after receiving the "...adding new
 patient........" message. "^" will delete the entry from the PATIENT file
 (#2) but not the entry in the IVM PATIENT file (#301.5).  Modification of
 routine DVBCPATA will correct this problem.  The post-install of this
 patch will delete entries in the IVM PATIENT file pointing to non-existent
 or non-veteran entries in the PATIENT file.  Corresponding entries in the
 IVM TRANSMISSION LOG file (#301.6) will also be deleted.
  
 This was reported in NOIS HOU-0798-72119.

  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*23):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*23.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
           DVBA C ENTER C&P REQUEST       Enter a C&P Exam Request
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
