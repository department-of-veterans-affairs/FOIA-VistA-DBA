Description:
============

 The Program Office had requested additions to the Treating Specialty file
 that have been released in patch DG*5.3*729.  Three surgical specialties 
 from the Surgical Specialty file (#45.3) were withheld from the update
 until the Surgery package could be updated.  This patch will update the 
 three surgical specialties, replacing their three digit code numbers, with
 their matching two digit code numbers found in the Specialty file (#42.4).
  
 Health Data and Informatics has plans to release a revised Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) Handbook on Patient Treatment File Coding 
 Instructions. The revised policy will require corresponding changes in the
 VistA PTF software package.  
  
 The following modifications are implemented in this patch, DG*5.3*757:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Rename Surgical Specialty Codes
      The following surgical specialty codes found in the Surgical 
      Specialty file (#45.3) will be replaced by their matching Specialty
      file (#42.4) two digit code values.
  
                  Code              Specialty
             From: 500    CARDIAC SURGERY
               To: 48     CARDIAC SURGERY
             From: 501    TRANSPLANTATION
               To: 49     TRANSPLANTATION
             From: 502    ANESTHESIOLOGY
               To: 78     ANESTHESIOLOGY
  
 2. Remove the Data Dictionary SCREENING from the Surgical Specialty field
     of the PTF 401 Subfile (#45.01,3).
  
 3. Add a Data Dictionary INPUT TRANSFORM to the Code (#.01) field of the
    Surgical Specialty (#45.3) File that will screen for codes between 48
    to 62, or code 78.
