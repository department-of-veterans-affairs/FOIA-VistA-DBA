Subject: PRESIDENT FORD FUNERAL (01/02/07) - GOVERNMENT CLOSING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 President George W. Bush issued an Executive order to close all Federal 
 offices on Tuesday, January 02, 2007, to allow Federal employees to join their
 fellow citizens in remembering Gerald R. Ford, the thirty-eighth President 
 of the United States. For purposes of pay and leave, January 02, 2007, is 
 being treated as a holiday.
  
 VA Central Office employees will be excused from duty for the scheduled 
 workday on Tuesday January 02, 2007. Employees who, in the judgment of the 
 head of the agency, cannot be excused for reasons of national security, 
 defense, or other essential public business, will not be excused from 
 duty.
  
 Post Install routine PRSXP113 will check Pay Period 06-26 to determine 
 if the holiday can be added to this pay period.
  
 Depending on the tours of duty worked by the employee the rules may 
 dictate adding the extra holiday to the next pay period.
  
 If Pay Period 07-01 has not been opened when this patch is installed, any 
 holidays that need to be posted in that pay period will be posted as the 
 pay period is opened.
  
 If Pay Period 07-01 has been opened when this patch is installed, the 
 PRSXP113 routine will make a second pass through PP 07-01 and will
 automatically post the extra holiday for employees who should have the
 holiday posted in this pay period.
