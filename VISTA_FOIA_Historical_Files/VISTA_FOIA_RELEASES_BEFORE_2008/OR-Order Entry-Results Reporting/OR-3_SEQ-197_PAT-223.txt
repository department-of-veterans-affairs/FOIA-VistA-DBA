Subject: TRUNCATED ORDER TEXT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem in the display of order text in CPRS.
 The text of an order can be removed/truncated if text in the order
 repeats.  This is most likely to occur in Text orders.  The example
 where this was identified was in a text order with the order text:
  
 one month F/u for lab only lipid profile and lft, 3 mo F/U see me and 
 get lipid profile and lft
  
 In this case the second occurrence of the text 'lipid profile and lft'
 was truncated.
  
 This patch resolves this issue by showing all the order text entered
 regardless of any duplication in the text of the order.
