Subject: NOT ALLOWING LAB TO ADD PATIENTS TO PATIENT FILE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Currently, the Laboratory application contains functionality that will 
 allow the user to add a new patient to the PATIENT (#2) file from within 
 the Laboratory Application.  However, due to IT Service Request 20030306 
 Patient Identity Management Services and HDR (Health Data Repository) Pilot,
 it has been requested that all ancillary applications, including Laboratory
 Service, remove such functionality.  For more information on this service
 request, view the following link:
  
 http://vista.med.va.gov/pas/ViewTrackingRecord.asp?RequestID=20030306
  
 Most, if not all, sites are not using the functionality that allows a patient 
 name to be added to the PATIENT (#2) file from the patient name prompt 
 within Lab menu options.  However, the functionality is in place and may be 
 used if the site has the ALLOW LAB TO ADD PATIENTS (#13) field of the
 LABORATORY SITE (#69.9) file set to 'Yes.'  If this field is set to 'Yes',
 any patient name prompt will accept a new patient name, one that does not
 currently exist in the PATIENT(#2) file, if the new patient name is entered
 twice.  See the example below:
  
 Select Laboratory DHCP Menu Option: 1  Phlebotomy menu
   
           Add tests to a given accession.
           Add tests to an already existing order number.
           Delete entire order or individual tests
           Itemized routine lab collection
           Lab orders by collection type
           Lab test order
           List of lab orders not collected
           List of orders not collected (Long form)
           Order/test status
           Print collection list/labels
           Print future collection labels
           Print single future collection label
           Receipt of routine lab collection from wards

 Select Patient Name: NEWPATIENT,JANE     <-- 2nd try - Name is accepted as a 
                                              new entry to the PATIENT(#2) file.

 A number of patient demographic fields are prompted before resuming the 
 prompting of fields required for the LAB TEST ORDER [LROW] option.  Most 
 options in Laboratory Service permit new patient names to be entered in the 
 format shown above.  Patch LR*5.2*305 was created to remove this 
 functionality from within the Laboratory Service application. 
  
 The following two changes to existing functionality are included in this 
 patch:
  
   1. The ALLOW LAB TO ADD PATIENTS (#13) field of the LABORATORY SITE 
      (#69.9) file has been modified so that it can no longer be set to
      'Yes.'  'No' is now the only answer allowed.
  
   2. The patient name prompt in menu options within Laboratory Service, 
      has been modified to no longer allow a new patient to be added to the 
      PATIENT (#2) file from within Lab.  See the example below:
  
 Select Laboratory DHCP Menu Option: 1  Phlebotomy menu
 
           Add tests to a given accession.
           Add tests to an already existing order number.
           Add to collection list
           Delete entire order or individual tests
           Itemized routine lab collection
           Lab orders by collection type
           Lab test order
           List of lab orders not collected
           List of orders not collected (Long form)
           Order/test status
           Print collection list/labels
           Print future collection labels
           Print single future collection label
           Receipt of routine lab collection from wards
           Test description information

 Select Phlebotomy menu Option: LAB TEST order

 The new patient name NEWPATIENT,JANE is not accepted.

 DD Updates:
 -----------
 The description of ALLOW LAB TO ADD PATIENTS field (#13) in the LABORATORY
 SITE file (#69.9) has been changed to indicate that field #13 is no longer
 functional, and the set code value '1' has been removed as a valid entry.
 
 From:

           DESCRIPTION: If the Lab is allowed to enter patients into
                the system, this field must contain a 'Yes' entry.  Only 
                lab users with the LRLAB key will make the changes and 
                only when using lab options.

   Installation Instructions: 
   ==========================
   Users may remain on the system, but installation should be done at off
   peak hours.  No options need to be placed out of service.  Installation 
   time is less than 1 minute during off peak hours and less than 5 minutes
   during peak hours.  Installation of this patch requires no additional 
   memory space.
 
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.
 
   2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they 
      should be removed from the mapped set at this time
 
   3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      
   4. On the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, select
      the 'Installation' menu.  You may elect to use the following options:
          a. Print Transport Global
          b. Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          d. Backup a Transport Global
 
   5. When ready, select the Install Packages option (when prompted for the
      INSTALL NAME, enter 'LR*5.2*305'.      
   
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond "NO".
 
   7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//', respond "NO".
 
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
  
   9. Using Fileman, verify that the ALLOW LAB TO ADD PATIENTS (#13) field 
      of the LABORATORY SITE file (#69.9) is set to 'No.'  If not, set it to
      'No.'  'No' is the only setting allowed after patch installation.
