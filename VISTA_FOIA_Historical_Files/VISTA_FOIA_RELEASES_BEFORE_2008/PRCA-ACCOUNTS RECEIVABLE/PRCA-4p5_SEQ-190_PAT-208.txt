 This patch will enhance existing functionality in the EDI Third Party
 Lockbox (e-Payments) process. The updated user documentation for this 
 patch may be found at the VistA University e-Payments web site:    
  
 http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/VistaU/e-bp/documents/e-PaymentsUserGuideV1.
 2.pdf
  
 In summary, this patch will make the following changes:
    1. Enhance the Worklist/scratch pad
      o  Provide auto and manual verification of EEOB (Electronic 
         Explanation of Benefits) claim data versus VistA data.
      o  Discrepancy report for unverified EEOBs.
      o  Allow multiple users to access an EEOB in the worklist at one time
         - Ability to split the ERA into batches
         - Ability to define the content of the batches
         - Limit the access to the following worklist actions when a user
           is within a batch, not the entire ERA (Electronic Remittance
           Advice):
              REFRESH SCRATCHPAD
              DISTRIBUTE ADJUSTMENTS
              PREVIEW RECEIPT
        -  Any negative amounts on an ERA must be distributed to other
           lines within the ERA before any individual batches can be
           accessed.
        -  Batch maintenance:
             Note: this function is locked with the new PRCA ERA BATCH
                   MAINT security key
             Allow for all batches to be edited.
             Allow for marking of all batches as ready to post.
             Allow to redefine the content of batches, add batching or
              remove all batches for the ERA.
        -  Provide a batch summary report for an ERA.
        -  Within batch maintenance, only allow for editing of the user's 
           specific batch if user is accessing a specific batch, not the
           entire ERA.
        -  If batches are created, they must all be marked as ready to 
           post before a receipt can be created for the ERA from within the
           worklist.
      o  Modify the review line option within the Worklist so that it is 
         either on all of the time or off all of the time, dependent upon
         user preference.
      o  Modify the review line function so each comment entered is
         identified by the user and date/time it was entered and/or
         edited. The users can now retrieve/edit their own review comments.
      o  Modify sorting of the Worklist to sort the way the user last 
         requested it to be sorted. 
      o  Use a list manager screen to display selection of ERAs to work on 
         (a new pick list screen).
  
    2.  Added a "note" to display the expected claim balance after the
        posting of payments within the ERA when using the increase and
        decrease adjustments options from the worklist menu.  Also, the
        claim balance in the EEOB list will also be updated with the new
        amount if an increase/decrease adjustment is made.
  
    3.  Included ERAs rejected due to no valid bills in the Exception
        report instead of just issuing a warning bulletin and deleting the
        ERA from the site.
  
    4.  Provide a report for active bills that have EEOBs associated with
        them.
  
    5.  Allow the user to search for payments using a trace # as well as
        a check # or credit card # in the LINK PAYMENT option and in the
        EXTENDED CHECK/CREDIT CARD SEARCH option.
  
    6.  Fixed a condition where the ERA exception bulletin is not sent if
        the name of the payer causes a length of more than 65 characters to
        be included in the subject line of the bulletin.
  
    7.  Added a warning to the ERA exception bulletin if the claim being
        paid is not an ACTIVE claim in the site's A/R (Accounts
        Receivable).
  
    8.  Added a new option to mark an ERA paid by a paper check 
        and received in error or as a duplicate payment as being sent back
        to the payer without posting.
  
    9.  Added a new report for DEPOSIT RECONCILIATION that details the
        FMS documents that are sent for the original CR for an EFT deposit
        and all the corresponding TR documents for the EFT detail.
  
   10. Fixed a problem on the EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) UNAPPLIED
       REPORT where the TRACE # is truncated.
  
   11. Fixed a problem in the option Update ERA Posted Using Paper EOB 
       (Explanation of Benefits) [RCDPE ERA POSTED BY PAPER EOB]. If the
       receipt # was not entered, the user still got a message that the ERA
       was updated when it really wasn't. The RECEIPT # is now a required
       field.  The data is repaired with the patch installation. 
  
   12. Fixed a problem on the EEOB worklist detail screen where hitting the
       Page Up control key actually takes the user into PREVIEW RECEIPT.
       Since the control key 'Page Up' uses PREV as its command, List
       Manager gets confused and executes the action PREVIEW RECEIPT
       because it starts with PREV.  The name of the PREVIEW RECEIPT action
       was changed to 'Look At Receipt' to prevent List Manager's
       confusion.  Although this is a List Manager problem, List Manager is
       only being supported for critical errors and this was not deemed to
       be critical.
  
   13. Corrected a condition in the RECEIPT PROCESSING option where a hard
       error occurs within the EDIT RECEIPT action.  The DR string of 
       editable fields was getting too long.
  
   14. Corrected 2 problems with transferring an EEOB to another site.  The
       first problem reported was that the EEOB did not get deleted
       automatically from the transferring site when the EEOB was accepted
       by the receiving site.  The second problem was the amount paid on
       the EEOB display within the data exceptions list at the receiving
       site was displaying with the decimal point moved 2 characters to the
       left so the wrong amount paid was being reported.  Both of these
       problems have been fixed.
   
   15. Fixed a problem in UNMATCH AN ERA [RCDPE UNMATCH ERA] option where
       the check # is not deleted when the status is changed to unmatched.
  
   16. Fixed a problem where a zero payment ERA is received but the method
       of payment indicates a CHECK will be sent.  These ERAs can now be
       marked as MATCHED - 0 payment when creating the worklist scratchpad
       for the ERA and this will remove them from an unposted status.    
       The existing records with this problem are repaired with the patch
       installation.
  
   17. Fixed a problem where multiple ERAs were assigned the same receipt #
       in the ERA worklist create receipt action.
  
   18. An environment check routine RCY208EN will be used to check if site
       has a CoreFLS version of software and recommends not to install this
       patch unless an accompanying update is made to the AR-CoreFLS
       software immediately after installation of this patch.
  
   19. A post-install routine RCY208PO has been included in this patch to
       perform the following functions:
  
       a.  Moves the data already existing as review notes in the field
           REVIEW NOTES (EDI LOCKBOX EOB WORKLIST file (#344.49), ERA 
           REFERENCE subfile (#344.491), REVIEW NOTES field (#3)) into the
           new field added by this patch - REVIEW (#4).  The old field was
           a word processing field with no specific format for the data.
           The new field is a multiple field and has separate fields for
           REVIEW DATE/TIME (#.01), REVIEWED BY (#.02), COMMENT (#.03) and
           LAST EDITED DATE/TIME (#.04).  This move automatically stuffs
           the current date/time for the DATE/TIME, the Postmaster for the
           REVIEWED BY and the following line is added to the top of the 
           COMMENT field before moving the content of  REVIEW NOTES into
           it: REVIEW COPIED HERE BY POST-INSTALL FOR e-PAYMENTS 
           ENHANCEMENTS PATCH.  After the data is moved, the old data in
           the REVIEW NOTES field is deleted from the system.
  
       b.  When the move of all the data from the REVIEW NOTES field to
           the new REVIEW field has successfully completed, the field
           REVIEW NOTES is deleted from the data dictionary.
  
       c.  The new cross reference 'AFD' on field FILE DATE/TIME (#.07) in
           the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) is populated by
           the post-install.
  
       d.  Checks all entries in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file 
           (#344.4) for any ERAs that have 0-payments and are matched to a
           paper check. These records will automatically be marked as
           MATCHED - 0-PAYMENT and POSTING NOT NEEDED.
  
       e.  Checks all entries in the EDI THIRD PARTY EFT DETAIL (#344.31) 
           file.  If any are found that are matched to paper EOBs because
           a receipt exists for them, but its status is still unmatched,
           the status is updated to remove it from the EFT Aging Report.
           This condition occurred because a software flaw in the
           initial version of e-Payments allowed association of the paper 
           EOB with the EFT detail record, but did not update the match
           status of the EFT detail record.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 CHY-0604-51834   Zero payment ERAs are being sent with a payment type 
                  of CHK indicating a zero dollar check will be received.
                  No check is ever received and the ERAs cannot be marked
                  as posted.  Fix is to allow these ERAs to be marked as
                  matched - 0 payment as long as the payment method is not
                  an EFT.
  
 MWV-0704-21208   ERAs are being assigned a duplicate receipt number in
                  the ERA Worklist create receipt functionality due to a
                  problem locking the records.  The fix is to lock the
                  receipt # record before assigning the receipt # to insure
                  only 1 ERA is assigned to each #.
