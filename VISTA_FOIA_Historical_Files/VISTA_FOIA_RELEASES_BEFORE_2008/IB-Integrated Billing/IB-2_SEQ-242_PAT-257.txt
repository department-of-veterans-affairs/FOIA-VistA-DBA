Subject: ADD QUANTITY FLAG TO'TYPE OF VISIT' FILE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Type of Visit file (357.69) holds a list of E&M codes (a subset of 
 CPT codes). Generally a quantity of 1 is all that is allowed for these 
 codes. There are cases, however, when this quantity should not be limited 
 to one. Therefore, there needs to be a field that will serve as a flag. 
 The field being added is the .06 field. It will have a value of N if the 
 quantity is to be restricted to only one and a value of Y if it allows a 
 quantity of greater than one. 
  
 A new menu option called IB EDIT E&M CODE QUANTITY FLAG will be added
 under the current menu option of IB SYSTEM DEFINITION MENU during 
 installation. This will run a new input template called IB EDIT E&M
 CODE QUANTITY.
