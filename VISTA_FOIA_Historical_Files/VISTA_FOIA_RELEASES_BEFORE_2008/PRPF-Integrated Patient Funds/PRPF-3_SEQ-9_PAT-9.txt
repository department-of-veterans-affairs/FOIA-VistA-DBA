Subject: PREVENT PURGING OF RECENT DATA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch prevents a possible future management error.  The default and
 maximum date for the Summarize and Purge Patient Funds Transactions [PRPF
 PURGE] was 'TODAY'. Logically one should not be purging "recent" data
 since that data may be appropriate for verification of activity in an
 account.
  
 To prevent recurrence of the costly efforts needed to restore deleted
 data that could reasonably be desired to be online, the maximum date for
 purging has been changed to 'TODAY-400'.
  
 The "date" issue is only with the Summarize and Purge Patient Funds
 Transactions [PRPF PURGE] option's second prompt. 
  
  
 [Suprisingly, the only Archiving possibility appears to be to "archive"
 everything (and one must archive before one can Summarize and Purge). 
 Note that all "Archiving" denotes is printing out all records to a device,
 e.g. magnetic tape or an HFS file; in particular, no records are changed
 in any way by the archive process.]
  
  
 The first prompt of the Summarize and Purge Patient Funds Transactions
 [PRPF PURGE] option is:
  
   This program will summarize and remove entries from the Patient Funds
   card and make a BALANCE CARRIED FORWARD entry for the summarized amount.
   OK to Continue? YES// 
  
 The second prompt is now date restricted (example below):
   
   The Summarize Through date must be no later than JUL 15,1998
     --  the earlier of 400 days before today and the date of the latest
         archive.
  
   Select the desired Summarize Through date: JUL 15,1998//
