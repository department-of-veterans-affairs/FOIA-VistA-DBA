Description: 
============

 This patch introduces two new pieces of functionality to the AICS
 software package:
 
 1. This patch provides to the users the ability to print Clinical Reminders
    on encounter forms.  Two new Toolkit blocks are also being added.
 
 2. Sites are reporting that a considerable amount of time is being spent
    dealing with Forms Tracking Entries that  are in a Pending Pages
    status.  A Forms Tracking entry goes to this status when one or
    more pages of a multiple page form is scanned. The entry stays in
    this status until all pages are scanned.  To reduce the  time required
    to deal with forms left in this state, a new process has been added
    to the nightly background job that prints encounter forms to find
    these entries and process them.  In addition, a new option to
    process these entries by date range is also being made available.
 
 Further description of these two new functions follow.
 
    1.  A new package interface is being added to display clinical
        reminders, along with 2 new tool kit blocks to allow for easy
        implementation.  Lists of specific reminders are created for each
        block using the standard AICS ability to create a list.  However,
        the display of Clinical Reminders is being changed so that only
        those reminders that are applicable to the patient are printed. 
        The forms designer can choose to print only all those reminders
        DUE NOW or all applicable reminders.  The 5 fields available
        for output are; the reminder name, a DUE NOW column,
        a Due Date column, a last activity column, and a column that
        will print DUE NOW or the future due date.
 
    2.  Sending data to PCE for Forms Tracking Entries in a Pending 
        Pages status can now be done as a part of the background job.
        A new parameter called DAYS TO RETAIN PENDING PAGES
        (#.11) has been added to the ENCOUNTER FORM PARAMETERS
        file (#357.09) and can be edited using the Edit Site Parameters
        [IBDF EDIT SITE PARAM] option.  If this parameter is null or is
        set to zero then the background job will not send the data from
        these forms tracking entries to PCE. The DAYS TO RETAIN
        PENDING PAGES is the number of days after the appointment
        date/time that the background job will pass the data to PCE.
 
        For Example, if the DAYS TO RETAIN PENDING PAGES is set to
        10, then the background job on October  20, 1999 will look for 
        the Forms Tracking Entries for October 10 appointments that are
        in a Pending Pages Status and will pass them to PCE.
 
        Sending data to PCE for Forms Tracking Entries in a Pending
        Pages status can also be done by a date range through the
        new option Send Forms Tracking Entries Pending Pages to PCE
        [IBDF FREE PENDING PAGES]. This option is locked with the
        IBD MANAGER Security Key. A mailman message will be sent
        to the user after the process is completed successfully indicating
        the number of forms sent to PCE and the number of forms
        generating errors.
 
  
  This patch also fixes a variety of problems in the nightly 'Background
  EF Print' [IBDF BACKGRD EF PRINT QUEUE] job:
   
     1.  Occasionally, a specific print group would start printing
         at a time different than specified in TIME QUEUED (#.13)
         subfield of the PRINT MGR'S QUEUING PARAM NAME
         (#357.091) subfile of the ENCOUNTER FORM PARAMETERS
         (#357.09) file. If the field TIME QUEUED has no value,
         each print job will start immediately after the nightly
         background job is scheduled to run.
     2.  Previously the TIME QUEUED field could contain
         a value that contained invalid data such as the letters "O"
         instead of zero or the letter "l" instead of the number one.
         This will be fixed in the post installation routine.
     3.  The nightly background job will now start the background
         printing of a specific group even if an active or pending task
         is specified in the parameters.  This will ensure that new
         print jobs will start even if the previous job failed to finish.
  
  After the installation of this patch, the nightly background job may not
  print encounter forms the first day based upon the time the nightly
  background job runs and the value in the TIME QUEUED field.  If this 
  occurs you may manually print these forms.  This situation will not 
  occur after the first day.
