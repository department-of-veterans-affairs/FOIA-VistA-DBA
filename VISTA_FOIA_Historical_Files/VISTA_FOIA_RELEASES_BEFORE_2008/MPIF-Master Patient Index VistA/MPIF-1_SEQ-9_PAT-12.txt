Subject: Wrong CMOR Assigned

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
  release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
  installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
  Implementation Manager for CIRN.
  
  ISSUE 1:  When selecting from a list of potential matches, the last CMOR 
  in the list is the CMOR that is populated in the CIRN MASTER OF RECORD 
  field (991.03) in the Patient file (#2).  This has been corrected to be
  the CMOR that is associated with the entry the user has selected from
  the list.  Routine MPIFQ1 corrects this problem.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
   
    2.  Stop Inbound HL7 filer(s) via the "Monitor, Start, Stop Filers"
        option on the "Filer and Link Management" menu which can be found
        on the "HL7 Main Menu".  
   
    3.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    4.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
   
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*12.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.  Please put the following options
        out of order:
   
         MPIF IND MPI LOAD       Single Patient Initialization to MPI
  
          
    10.  Restart the HL7 Inbound filer(s) via the same options in step #2.
  
    11.  If in step 4 you unmapped routines, remap them now.
