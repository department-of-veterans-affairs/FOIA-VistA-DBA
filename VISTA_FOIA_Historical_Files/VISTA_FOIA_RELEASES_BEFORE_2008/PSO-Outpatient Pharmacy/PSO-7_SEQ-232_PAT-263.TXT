 Problem:
 --------
 When using the RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES option [PSOCP RESET 
 COPAY STATUS], entering a single character at the PRESRIPTION RX# prompt
 results in an undefined error.

 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Allow the editing of SERVICE/SECTION field (#29)in the NEW PERSON file 
 (#200) and PERSON CLASS field (#8932.1) in the NEW PERSON file (#200) if
 the provider is of type Fee Basis
