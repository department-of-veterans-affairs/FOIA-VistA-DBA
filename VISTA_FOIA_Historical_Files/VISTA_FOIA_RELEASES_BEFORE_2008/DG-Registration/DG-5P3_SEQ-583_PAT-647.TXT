Subject: COLLATERAL PATIENT REGISTRATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch corrects a problem when timing out while registering collateral
 patients, when adding a patient using Fileman and updating the name
 components, and when processing address data returned from the query
 to the last site treated. 
  
  ASSOCIATED NOISes:

  1) ISB-0804-31946     Creation of PATIENT file record 
     (HD64154)

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  
 1) Ticket 64154 (NOIS ISB-0804-31946)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When collateral patients are registered, if the user times out at
 the Patient Collateral Sponsor's Name, a system error occurs and
 MPI processes are adversely affected.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 DPTLK2 has been further modified for collateral patients so that  
 the record creation process does not start until all identifier
 prompts have been answered.
  
 2) Ticket 64864 (NOIS ISP-0205-N0466)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When adding a patient using Fileman (not recommended), and updating 
 the patient name components, a system error occurs.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 DPTLK has been modified to New variables DIE and DR on entry.
  
 3) Ticket 64835 (NOIS BRX-0205-10285)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 If the data returned from the last site treated (in response to the 
 Register Once Messaging (ROM) query) includes the County but not 
 the State, a system error occurs.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 DGROHLR1 has been modified to check whether the State contains data,
 and if not, to bypass the County update.

         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
