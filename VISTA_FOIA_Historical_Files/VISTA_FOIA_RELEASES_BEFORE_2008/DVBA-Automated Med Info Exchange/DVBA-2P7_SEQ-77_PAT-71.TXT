Associated patches: (v)DVBA*2.7*57 <<= must be installed BEFORE `DVBA*2.7*71'

Subject: CAPRI GUI UPDATE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch has been released to announce an update to the
 CAPRI GUI executable.  This new version of CAPRI provides enhancements to 
 both the Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module (previously added in 
 patch DVBA*2.7*66) and to the administrative functions used by VBA.
  
 The CAPRI application was originally implemented to expedite the VBA 
 claims process by creating a more efficient means of requesting C&P 
 examinations and navigating through existing patient records to fulfill 
 the evidentiary requirements of a disability claim.  It handles most 
 administrative aspects of the examination process.  With the addition of
 the Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) in patch DVBA*2.7*66,
 CAPRI has make its official introduction into the medical center.
  
 The CAPRI GUI will need to be installed on the desktops of all VHA staff
 involved in the C&P process - from the examiner actually performing C&P
 examinations to the administrative clerk responsible for coordinating the
 exam processing.  Because of its integration with TIU and CPRS, the site's
 Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) will need to be familiar with the
 new CAPRI CPWM functionality and may also choose to have it installed as
 well.

 USER ACCESS TO CAPRI
 ====================
 The CAPRI GUI follows all standards for VistA applications.  Users must 
 have a valid VistA user account to access any VistA application.  
 Additionally, in order to gain access to the CAPRI application, and more 
 specifically the CPWM portion of CAPRI, each user will need to be 
 assigned the VistA menu option and security keys outlined below.  
 Please refer to the CAPRI CPWM User Guide for details on the functionality
 controlled by the assigning of the menu option and security keys.
  
 VistA Menu Option
 -----------------
 All CAPRI users need the following menu option assigned as their 
 secondary menu option or as an item on their primary menu.
  
   DVBA CAPRI GUI - This is the option context to the main CAPRI 
   application.  All CAPRI users will need this menu option assigned.
  
 VistA Security Keys
 -------------------
 All CAPRI users that will be accessing the C&P Worksheet Module will need 
 at least two and potentially three security keys assigned.  It is 
 important that the IRM staff coordinate with the C&P clinic to determine 
 what keys each user should receive.  The assigning of keys will affect 
 local procedures.  The majority of users will only need two new keys.  
 The users designated to act as Reviewers will need the additional 
 Reviewer key.
  
 1. DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB - This key makes the C&P Worksheets tab 
    visible inside CAPRI.  All CAPRI users that will be involved in the 
    processing of the C&P templates should get this key.
  
 2. One of the following keys should be assigned to all users assigned the
    previous key.  Before assigning the keys, it is important that the
    functions of these keys be understood as they allow whether or not that
    user has the ability to sign and complete a template.  See the Review
    Functionality section of the User Guide for more details on the
    reviewer processes.  Only ONE of these keys should be assigned due to
    the conflicting functionality supported by each:
  
    a. DVBAB CPWM DISALLOW REVIEW - User does not need and can not have 
       their examination templates reviewed prior to release.  Should only
       be assigned at sites that will not be implementing the reviewer
       process.  This allows the user to directly release their examination
       in AMIE.
    b. DVBAB CPWM OPTIONAL REVIEW - User can choose to either send an 
       examination template for review or sign and release the template 
       themselves.  This key will typically be assigned to a user who needs
       some, but not all, of their examinations reviewed before they're
       released.
    c. DVBAB CPWM REQUIRE REVIEW - User must have all examination templates
       reviewed by a reviewer prior to signing and can not release any 
       examinations until approved by the reviewer.
  
 3. If the site chooses to use the review process (meaning either the 
    OPTIONAL REVIEW or REQUIRE REVIEW key has been assigned to anyone) at 
    least one user must be designated as a Reviewer and be assigned the
    DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER key.  It is expected that if the Reviewer process
    is implemented at a site, that multiple people will be assigned this
    key to cover for cases where the primary reviewer is unavailable.
