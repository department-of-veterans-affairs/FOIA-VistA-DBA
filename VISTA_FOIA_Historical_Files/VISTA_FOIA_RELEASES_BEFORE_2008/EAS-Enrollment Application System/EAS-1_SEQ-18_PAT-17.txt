Description: 
============

 Note:  Patches SD*5.3*263 and EAS*1.0*17 are being released in a single
 Distribution.  
  
 The Electronic Wait List (EWL) will aid in the process of monitoring the 
 demand and capacity for care at VA medical facilities.  Currently there is
 no national VHA software to list and track patients waiting for 
 appointments, primary care (PC) team assignments, or a primary care 
 provider (PCP) assignments.  The EWL will assist VA Medical Centers, 
 Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC's) and the VHA Central Office in 
 managing veterans' access to outpatient health care.
  
 Patch EAS*1*17 provides an API to return the Verified enrollment date or
 the Enrollment Application Date (when no verified enrollment record is
 available) from the PATIENT ENROLLMENT File, #27.11, for the Electronic 
 Wait List (EWL) which will be released by patch SD*5.3*263. This patch 
 implements DBIA# 3624, which is a private usage Database Integration 
 Agreement between the Enrollment Application System package and the 
 Scheduling package in support of Scheduling patch SD*5.3*263.  See DBIA# 
 3624 for full documentation on API call and parameters.
