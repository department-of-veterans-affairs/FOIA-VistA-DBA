Subject: DEFAULT APP'T TYPE NOT BEING UPDATED IN ENCOUNTER FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix a problem which occurs when using an Event Capture 
 clinic location that has a default Appointment Type of Research.  When 
 the nightly data feed to PCE is run and an encounter is created in the 
 Outpatient Encounter file (409.68), the Appointment Type field is being 
 set to either Regular or Computer Generated.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD64618 - ALB-0105-50315  Default App't type not being updated in 
                   Encounter File
       duplicate - HD85480 - Appointment Type changes to Regular
    Problem:
    --------
    When using an Event Capture clinic location that has a Default
    Appointment Type of RESEARCH, when the Event Capture Nightly Data
    Feed to PCE is run and a new encounter is created in the Outpatient
    Encounter file (409.68), the Appointment Type field is being set to
    either Regular or Computer Generated.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    New logic will be added to routine ECPCEU (the data feed utility
    routine), to pass the Default Appointment Type for the selected
    clinic location, if it is defined, as part of the nightly data
    feed to PCE.  This will insure the Appointment Type field in file
    409.68 is properly set to the Default Appointment Type contained
    in file 44 for the selected clinic location, when applicable.
