Subject: Undef at PCHK2+1~XUHUI

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issues:
  
  1.  If a user is terminated and they have an entry in the KEYS multiple 
 (#51) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) that pointed to a non-existent entry
 in the SECURITY KEY file (#19.1), that is a broken pointer, then an
 Undefined error would occur at: Line: PCHK2+1; Routine: XUHUI.
  NOIS: DUB-1102-30549
  
 2.  If the DISABLE field (#2) is defined, that is not null, in the
 PROTOCOL file (#101) and the execution of the protocol was done in the
 background, then a <COMMAND> error would occur at:
  Line: READ; Routine XQOR4
 on a Cache system running version 4.x when attempting to Read from the 
 NULL device.  A check is now made to see if the protocol being passed in 
 is DISABLED and if so then no task is created.
  NOIS: ANM-1102-N0565
