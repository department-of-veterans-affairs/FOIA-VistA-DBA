Description:
============

  
 *************************************************************************
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * 
 * Clinics should not be designated as an IMO location until after the
 * installation of patch OR*3*215 (CPRS GUI v26).  Patch SD*5.3*285
 * provides the ability to designate a clinic as an IMO location by 
 * setting the ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS? field (file #44, field #2802)
 * to YES.  However, IMO should not be activated prior to installation
 * of OR*3*215.  Therefore it is recommended that SD*5.3*285 be installed
 * immediately prior to or at least on the same day as patch OR*3*215 in
 * order to prevent the possibility of designating a clinic as an IMO
 * location and/or the implementation of IMO functionality before the
 * installation of OR*3*215.
 *
 *************************************************************************
  
 The purpose of this patch is to:
 1) Provide an API to determine if a specific patient at a specific 
    clinic is qualified to receive inpatient medication.
 2) Install a new field, ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS?, in the HOSPITAL
    LOCATION file (#44).
 3) Install new stand-alone option INPATIENT MEDICATIONS TO CLINIC to 
    allow a user to update the "ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS?" field.
 4) Install an updated version of the template used during option
    SET UP A CLINIC [SDBUILD] to include a prompt for field "ADMINISTER
    INPATIENT MEDS?".
  
  
 PATCH COMPONENTS
 ================
  
 - API SDIMO^SDAMA203(CLIEN,DFN).  See SD_53_285_TM.pdf for details.
  
 - New field #2802, "ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS?", in the HOSPITAL LOCATION
   file (#44).  This field will reflect if this location is authorized to
   dispense inpatient medications to outpatients.
  
 - Modified template SDB. This template is used during option SET UP A 
   CLINIC [SDBUILD] to include a prompt for field "ADMINISTER INPATIENT
   MEDS?".  An additional prompt has been added to the SET UP A CLINIC 
   option under the Scheduling Supervisor's menu. This prompt should only be
   answered with a YES if the clinic is authorized to dispense inpatient 
   medications to outpatients. The field should be left blank if not 
   authorized.
  
 - New stand-alone option INPATIENT MEDICATIONS TO CLINIC [SD IMO EDIT]
   uses new template SD IMO.  This stand alone option will allow the user to 
   enter a YES or remove the YES in the field "ADMINISTER INPATIENT MEDS?" 
   in the hospital location file indicating if that location is authorized
   to dispense inpatient medications to outpatients.
