Description:
============

  It is imperative that you follow the proper sequence of loading and
  installing this patch along with the new global file. If not done in the
  correct sequence, errors could occur when attempting to print Patient
  Medication Information Sheets.
  
  
  
  This patch requires patches PSN*4*74 and PSN*4*75. This patch is required
  to provide updates to data in several files in order to print the latest
  Patient Medication Information Sheets. This patch will reset fields
  in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68). These fields are GCNSEQNO field (#11),
  PREVIOUS GCNSEQNO field (#12), and NDC LINK TO GCNSEQNO field (#13). This
  is accomplished by data stored in a transport global included in this
  patch. The source for the Patient Medication Information Sheet data
  is First Data Bank.
  
  
  
  Follow the instructions carefully. Do NOT put options "Back in Order" until
  the installation of PSN*4*76 has been completed.
  
  Options to be placed "Out of Order" include:
  
  Print a PMI Sheet [PSNPMIS PRINT] option
  Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
  Release Medication [PSO RELEASE] option
  Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT] option
  
  Data files to be DELETED include:

  Installation Instructions and Software Retrieval:
  =================================================
  The data for these files (#50.621 - 50.627) is provided via the file
  NDF4P76.GBL and is not included in this patch distribution. 
  
  
  This file can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
  the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to FTP the file from
  DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV, which will transmit the file from
  the first available server. Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve 
  the file from a specific OI Field Office.
  
    OI FIELD OFFICE     FTP ADDRESS                    DIRECTORY
    Albany              FTP.FO-ALBANY.MED.VA.GOV       anonymous.software
    Hines               FTP.FO-HINES.MED.VA.GOV        anonymous.software
    Salt Lake City      FTP.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV          anonymous.software
  
  The software distribution includes:
  
  FILE NAME              DESCRIPTION             BLOCK SIZE
  
  NDF4P76.GBL            Global Save             61401 blocks (31048089 bytes)
  
  
  The installation of PSN*4*76 should be done during NON-PEAK hours
  when most users of Pharmacy and Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS)
  are off the system since the Patient Medication Information Sheets will not
  be available during the patch installations.
  
  The amount of time to retrieve the global file NDF4P76.GBL from the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory will vary. That is why it is important to
  retrieve the global before beginning the installation process for PSN*4*76.
  
  
  The entire process for loading the new data contained in NDF4P76.GBL
  and installing PSN*4*76 will take approximately 10 minutes.
  Be sure to retrieve the file NDF4P76.GBL before beginning the process.  
  
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
  
  
  INSTALLATION STEPS FOR PSN*4*76: 
  
  1. Retrieve the new global file NDF4P76.GBL. Do NOT install (restore)
     NDF4P76.GBL until step 4.
  
  2. Place the following user options "Out of Order".
  
     Print a PMI Sheet [PSNPMIS PRINT] option

     Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT] option
  
  3. Use the option provided in the PSN*4*75 patch entitled Delete Patient
     Medication Information Sheet Data [PSNDELTE] option. This is a
     stand-alone option that will delete the data files related to
     Patient Medication Information Sheets.
  
  4. Restore the globals from file NDF4P76.GBL using the appropriate
     Operating System utility. If you have not restored a global before OR
     are unsure which utility to use, you should contact your System Manager.
  
     If you are using a DSM platform use:       ^%GTI
     If you are using a CACHE platform use:     ^%GI
     If you are using a VMS/CACHE platform use: ^%GI
  
     At the Input Device prompt (DSM) or the Device prompt (CACHE), enter
     NDF4P76.GBL. Take the defaults for any other prompts.
  
  5. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  6. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  7. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*76).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  8. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*76.
  
  9. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.

      Print a PMI Sheet [PSNPMIS PRINT] option
      Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
      Release Medication [PSO RELEASE] option
      Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT] option
