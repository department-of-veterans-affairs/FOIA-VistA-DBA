Subject: MISSED MED REPORT SHOWS DOSES GIVEN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the issue as reported in HD107649 in which the 
 Missed Medication Report displays drugs which have been previously 
 given. It will also correct an error generated when the Medical 
 Administrative History report is run as reported in HD131650 and HD140535.
  
 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 ==========================
 HD107649 - Missed Med Report shows doses given
 HD131650 - <SUBSCRIPT> Error
 HD140535 - Receiving <UNDEFINED>PSBOUT+13^PSBOMH1 error
  
 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 Problem 1:
 When a drug is given for its scheduled Admin times and an edit is made
 to those Admin times, the Missed Medication report will show the new Admin
 times as Missed even though the new Admin times did not exist at the time
 the drug was originally ordered/given.
  
 Solution 1:
 The Missed Medication Report will be modified to check the Audit Trail for
 edited Admin times and set the reporting parameters to use the Admin times
 effective on the date of the report.
  
 Problem 2:
 Medication Admin History (MAH) report generates a <SUBSCRIPT> error when
 attempting to print the initials for a user that does not have initials
 defined in the NEW PERSON file (#200).
  
 Solution 2:
 The MAH report has been modified to accommodate users without initials 
 defined in the NEW PERSON file (#200). The report will now print the
 history information without user initials when not defined.
  
 Problem 3:
 The MAH report generates an <UNDEFINED> error when printing IV 
 information for which the ACTION Date/Time has been edited to an earlier 
 time than the actual INFUSING Date/Time.
  
 Solution 3:
 The MAH report has been modified to retrieve user ID information from the 
 ENTERED BY field (.05) from BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79).
