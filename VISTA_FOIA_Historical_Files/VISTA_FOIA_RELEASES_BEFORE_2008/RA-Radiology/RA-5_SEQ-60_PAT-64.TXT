Description:
============

 The relative value unit (RVU) is a measure of the time and effort
 associated with the performance of a given procedure.  The Centers for
 Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) has incorporated RVUs into the Medicare
 physician fee schedule.  Radiologists spend a majority of their workday
 involved with procedures, so the RVU can account for much of their
 workload.  To be consistent with the current practices of the Office of
 Quality and Performance, there will be no national roll-up of RVU report
 data as reports contain provider specific RVU totals.
  
 Previous personnel workload reports such as the 'Staff Report' work off 
 of AMIS Code, AMIS Code Weight, AMIS Code multiplier, and the bilateral 
 indicator linked to the AMIS code. The 'Staff Report' also looks at all 
 the exams for a particular staff physician; cancelled cases and cases 
 without a verified report are counted to be part of a physician's 
 workload.
  
 The new personnel workload reports work off of the wRVU value associated 
 with the CPT code of the rad/nuc med procedure. The application of 
 scaling factors (if appropriate) is based on the imaging type of a 
 procedure and is applied as a multiplier to the wRVU value for a rad/nuc 
 med procedure.
  
 The criteria used to determine physician workload differs from business 
 rules applied to workload reports in the past; physician specific exams 
 must not be in an examination status of cancelled and all non-cancelled 
 exams must be linked to verified reports.
  
 The Inspector General (IG) has indicated that physician productivity will
 be included in Combined Assessment Program (CAP) audits.  The RVU reports
 would be used locally to satisfy IG requirements. To meet these goals, 
 both FB*3.5*93 and RA*5.0*64 have been created.
  
 For more information of FB*3.5*93, please refer to the FB*3.5*93 patch

   Data Dictionaries: 
   ------------------
   IMAGING TYPE (#79.2) data does not come with the file (see Note below),
   Data dictionaries are updated; a new sub-file has been added: WORK RVU
   (wRVU) SCALING FACTOR (#79.22)
  
   Note: The Society of Chairmen of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD)
         has determined that the wRVU (which was derived for billing) may 
         over or under estimate the actual time required to interpret a
         study and has proposed scaling factors to better calculate
         personal workload.
  
     
     79.2,200  WORK RVU (wRVU) SCALING FACTOR CY;0 Multiple #79.22
  
              DESCRIPTION: Identifies the 'Society of Chairmen in Academic
                           Radiology Departments' (SCARD) scaling factor
                           for a specific imaging type by calendar year.

              DESCRIPTION: This field identifies the calendar year to
                           associate a specific 'Society of Chairmen in
                           Academic Radiology Departments' (SCARD) scaling
                           factor to imaging type specific procedures with
                           an associated wRVU value.
  
  
     79.22,2    SCALING FACTOR    node: 0, piece: 2, data type: number
              Acceptable numeric range: 0-99.99    
  
              DESCRIPTION: This field identifies the appropriate scaling
                           factor applied to the wRVU value for an imaging
                           type specific rad/nuc med procedure.
  
    Note: The new sub-file will be populated by a post-install (RA64PST) 
          process. Calendar year 2006 scaling factors will only be
          introduced for the following IMAGING TYPE records: 'GENERAL
          RADIOLOGY, 'NUCLEAR MEDICINE', 'MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING', 'CT
          SCAN', and 'ANGIO/NEURO/INTERVENTIONAL'. For calendar year 2006
          scaling factors will not be introduced for the following imaging
          types: 'ULTRASOUND', 'CARDIOLOGY STUDIES (NUC MED)', 'VASCULAR
          LAB', and 'MAMMOGRAPHY' because the wRVU values used to compute
          personal productivity within these imaging types are accurate.

        message of any routines exported with the patch.
    
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed.
    
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  3.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
      When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*64
   
       When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? YES//" answer according to your facility's policy 
       concerning the rebuilding of menu trees.
  
       When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//", respond NO.
   
       When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
       YES//", respond YES.      
  
       When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",

       When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
       enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
         RA*
   
  4.  A pre-installation will run at sites that have previously installed a
      version of RA*5.0*64 that will change the MENU TEXT for the following
      options (3):
       1) RA WKLIPHY CPT ITYPE
          From: Physician CPT Report by I-Type
            To: Physician CPT Report by Imaging Type
       2) RA WKLIPHY SWRVU ITYPE
          From: Physician scaled wRVU Report by I-Type
            To: Physician scaled wRVU Report by Imaging Type
       3) RA WKLIPHY WRVU ITYPE
          From: Physician wRVU Report by I-Type
            To: Physician wRVU Report by Imaging Type
  
  5.  Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
      KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
      PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*64).
  
  6.  After the post-installation has completed successfully, the following
      action should be taken:
        
        Delete the following routines: RA64PRE & RA64PST
