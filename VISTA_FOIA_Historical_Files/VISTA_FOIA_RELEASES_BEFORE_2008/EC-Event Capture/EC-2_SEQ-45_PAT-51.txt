Subject: ECS SETUP IN CPRS TOOLS MENU

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 EC*2.0*51 is an informational patch pertaining to running the Event Capture 
 Interface option from the CPRS Tools Menu.  This patch is being released in 
 conjunction with CPRS patch OR*3*173.
 
 In CPRS V20, when accessing "Event Capture Interface" option from the CPRS 
 Tools Menu, it was hard-coded to look at the default path of 
 "C:\Program Files\vista\EC".  If EC GUI is not found in the default path,
 then the user was given the option of locating the program by browsing.  
 However, once located, the path was never saved and this process was 
 repeated each time the "Event Capture Interface" option was accessed.
 
 CPRS V22, patch OR*3*173 has addressed this problem by making use of the 
 set-up with the 'GUI Tool Menu Items' options of the 'CPRS Configuration 
 (Clin Coord)' menu.  
 
 ACTION NEEDED: In order to run 'Event Capture Interface' from the CPRS 
                Tools Menu, site IRMs would need to add a new entry: 
                Event Capture Interface="X:\xxx\.\ECS GUI.EXE" using the 
                'GUI Tool Menu Items' option to store the ECS path. 
 
   
 NOTES:         If your site already has the Event Capture GUI application 
                defined using the 'GUI Tool Menu Items' option, the path 
                must be the same when setting up the 'Event Capture 
                Interface' for production.  It may be different for testing.
    
                The 'Event Capture Interface' parameter will allow a user to 
                access Event Capture encounters for the patient selected from 
                CPRS.  If defined as Event Capture, then the entire application 
                will be available and users will be prompted for a second logon.
    
   
 CAUTION:       When adding the EC parameter, care must be taken to spell 
                'Event Capture Interface' exactly and correctly.  Otherwise, 
                the option will not be available to users for selection.  
                Case does not matter.
