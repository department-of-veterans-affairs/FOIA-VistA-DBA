Description:
============

 Description
 ===========
 This patch will release two new National Health Summary Components required 
 by the VA Geriatric Extended Care (GEC) Referral project.
 
                GECC - GEC Completed Referral Count
                GECH - GEC Health Factor Category
 
 The GEC Completed Referral Count component will display the total number of 
 completed GEC referrals done on a patient. Each completed referral will 
 show the date the referral was started, the date the referral was completed 
 and the associated Health Factors.
 
 The GEC Health Factor Category component is identical to the current 
 Selected Health Factor component except for the selection items. This 
 component will only display a list of Health Factors that are associated 
 with the GEC project.
 
 For more documentation on VA Geriatric Extended Care project please see the 
 Clinical Reminders 2.0 Setup guide and the User Manual found under the 
 Clinical Reminders section of the VistA Documentation Library 
 (http://www.va.gov/vdl/Clinical.asp?appID=60).
 
 This patch also supports Clinical Reminders changes for MyHealtheVet
 To support MyHealtheVet we are releasing two new Components:
     MHV REMINDERS DETAIL DISPLAY
     MHV REMINDERS DETAIL DISPLAY
 
 And two new Remote Data Views:
 
     REMOTE MHV REMINDERS DETAIL
     REMOTE MHV REMINDERS SUMMARY
 
 These components will now search through file 811.9 and evaluate any 
 Clinical Reminder definition that is defined for patient use and display 
 the results of the evaulation in Health Summary.
 
 These four new components are stored in file #142.1 and the two new Remote 
 Data Views are stored in file #142.
 
 E3R
 ===
 E3R #17227, CONFIGURE INDIV HF WITH 'SHF' COMPONENT
 
 Also included in this patch is a change to the Selected Health Factor 
 component by allowing the user to select either a Health Factor Category or 
 an individual Health Factor. The Selected Health Factor component will 
 display  "(category) or (factor)"  after the name of the item.  For the 
 output data to be correct, patch PX*1.0*123 must be installed.
 
 Misc. Fixes
 ===========
 This patch fixes a problem discovered while testing TIU*1.0*135. Currently, 
 if you have a TIU HS object that displays data from a Health Summary type 
 with no assigned components, you will receive an error in CPRS. This patch 
 fixes this problem by displaying "No Health Summary Components" in the TIU 
 HS Object display text.
 
 Data Dictionary
 ==============
 DD number 142 will be exported with this patch. This will fix duplicate 
 DIC(S) screen entries for the selection-items multiple. This problem was 
 discovered at some sites. The modified DD will also set a screen for GEC 
 Health Factor Category.
