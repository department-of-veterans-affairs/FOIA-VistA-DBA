Subject: State File Check/Clean-up

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
 Because more and more packages are depending on correct addressing 
 information, the following patch is being sent to ensure that the 
 STATE(#5) file has the correct values for the following fields:
   .01       NAME
   1         ABBREVIATION
   2         VA STATE CODE
  
 The pre-installation routine: XU8P307 will look at the STATE(#5) file
 using the following list, if no problems are found then the following
 dialog will be displayed:
  
   Your STATE(#5) file is fine.
  
 On the other hand, if problems are found then a list will be generated 
 (see example dialog below).  Please note that pre-installation routine: 
 XU8P307 will not be deleted from your system so that it maybe run from the
 programmer's prompt as many times as necessary by entering at the 
 programmer's prompt: D ^XU8P307 until the no problems found dialog is 
 displayed.
  
 If sites should choose to add/edit entries in their STATE(#5) file before
 installing this patch, the following list should be used:
