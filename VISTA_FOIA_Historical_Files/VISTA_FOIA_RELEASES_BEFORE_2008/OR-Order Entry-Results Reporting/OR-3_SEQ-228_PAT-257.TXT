 This patch restores the package level setting of the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL
 parameter, which was inadvertently cleared out by OR*3*215 (CPRS GUI v26).
 This parameter is the default time & occurrence limit for all reports on the
 reports tab.  Reports using this default value would not return any data.
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000142859 - ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL
  
 Participating Test Sites:

 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000142859 - ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL 
  
 Problem:
   After installation of OR*3*215, the package level setting of the ORWRP
   TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL parameter was deleted.  If a setting for this parameter
   has not been set at the System, Division or User level, and if the specific
   report being run does not have a setting in the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV
   parameter, a report will not return any data.
  
 Resolution:
   The package level setting of the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL parameter has
   been reset to it's original default value of T-7;T;10.
  
  
 Routine Summary:
 ----------------
 ORY257   Post install routine that sets the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL
          parameter to T-7;T;10. 
  
  
 NOTE: The Post install routine ORY257 will be automatically deleted after
 the installation of the patch.
