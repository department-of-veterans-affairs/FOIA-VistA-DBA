Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
  
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.
  
 This patch includes the following modifications:
  
 1. ECME User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN]
    1.1. The ECME User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN] was modified to display
         the Fill Date for the Rx on the ECME User Screen.
    1.2. The ECME User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN] was modified to display
         the Reject Code/Reason for each Rx when the user is utilizing the
         Close Rejected Claim [BPS PRTCL USRSCR CLOSE] protocol.
    1.3. The new Resubmit Claim w/EDITS [BPS PRTCL USRSCR RESUBMIT EDITS]
         protocol was introduced and placed in the ECME User Screen Hidden
         Actions [BPS PRTCL USRSCR HIDDEN ACTIONS] protocol menu of the ECME
         User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN].  This was done in order to
         provide a hidden option to enable three data fields (Relationship
         Code, Person Code, and Prior-Authorization Number) on previously
         rejected electronic claims to be edited and for the claim to be
         resubmitted (containing the new edit information).
  
 2. Re Open CLOSED Claim option [BPS REOPEN CLOSED CLAIM]
    This new menu option was introduced to allow the user to re-open an
    electronic claim after it has been closed. The new option will prompt the
    user to enter a patient name and date range to select closed claims for
    the re-open menu screen.  The user is then able to select one closed claim,
    enter a re-open comment, and re-open it.  The Re Open CLOSED Claim option
    [BPS REOPEN CLOSED CLAIM] calls an Integrated Billing (IB) function to
    update the Claim Tracking record and create a REOPEN event for the ECME
    Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option.
  
 3. Payable Claims Report option [BPS RPT PAYABLE]
    The Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE] was incorrectly deducting the
    Patient Paid Amount from the Total Payment Amount in its calculation for
    the $INS RESPONSE column on the report.  The report has been changed to no
    longer deduct the patient paid amount when determining the $INS RESPONSE
    value.
  
 4. Register Pharmacy with Austin Automation Center option [BPS SETUP REGISTER
    PHARMACY]
    A new field (STATUS (#.1)) has been added to the BPS PHARMACIES
    (#9002313.56) file.  The pharmacy registration message that is sent to the
    Austin Automation Center (AAC) now indicates whether the pharmacy is active
    or inactive based on the value of this field.  Users can change the
    value of this field via the Register with Austin Automation Center
    option [BPS SETUP REGISTER PHARMACY].  For new BPS pharmacies, this field
    is defaulted to ACTIVE.  This option was also changed so the BPS Pharmacy
    NAME (#.01) field of the BPS PHARMACIES (#9002313.56) file can no longer
    be edited or deleted.
  
 5. Edit ECME Pharmacy Data option [BPS SETUP PHARMACY]
    The Edit ECME Pharmacy Data option [BPS SETUP PHARMACY] was modified to
    prevent linkage of an OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) entity to more than
    one ECME BPS PHARMACIES file (#9002313.56) record.  In addition, the
    option was modified to prevent users from editing the NCPDP field (#.02)
    and the NAME field (#.01) of the BPS PHARMACIES (#9002313.56) file.
    The new STATUS (#.1) field of the BPS PHARMACIES (#9002313.56) file,
    which indicates whether the BPS Pharmacy is ACTIVE or INACTIVE, is also
    displayed in this option.     
  
 6. View/Unstrand Claims Not Completed option [BPS UNSTRAND SCREEN]
    This option was modified to prevent errors from occurring when a site has
    no completed claims.
  
 7. Replacing direct access reads to the DRUG file (#50)
    This patch modifies a number of BPS namespace routines in order to
    eliminate any direct access reads to the DRUG file (#50).  Each direct
    access read occurrence has been modified to utilize approved functions
    designed by the Pharmacy Encapsulation team.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. Remedy Ticket 140691 (Deactivating a Registered Pharmacy)
 2. Remedy Ticket 150861 (Multiple Error Messages in Error Trap)
 3. Remedy Ticket 148711 (ECME Payable Claims Detail Report (EVNT) does not
                         accurately reflect the $INS RESPONSE field)
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. Remedy Ticket 140691 (Deactivating a Registered Pharmacy) - Site cannot
    deactivate a registered pharmacy. The ECME code has no functionality
    for sending a deactivate transaction (MDC). In addition, while researching
    the issue it was noted that the Register Pharmacy with Austin Automation
    Center option [BPS SETUP REGISTER PHARMACY] allows a user to delete
    a BPS Pharmacy, which could leave dangling pointers in the BPS TRANSACTION
    (#9002313.56) file and result in data degradation.  A new STATUS (#.1)
    field was added to the BPS PHARMACIES (#9002313.56) file and the users can
    edit this field via the  Register Pharmacy with Austin Automation Center
    option [BPS SETUP REGISTER PHARMACY].  The same option was also modified
    to prevent the deletion of a BPS Pharmacy.
  
 2. Remedy Ticket 150861 (Multiple Error Messages in Error Trap) - The
    View/Unstrand Claims Not Completed [BPS UNSTRAND SCREEN] option is
    generating errors.  This error occurs when a site has no completed claims.
    The code was corrected so that the option works correctly even if there are
    no completed claims.
  
 3. Remedy Ticket 148711 (ECME Payable Claims Detail Report (EVNT) does not
    accurately reflect the $INS RESPONSE field) - The Payable Claims Report
    option [BPS RPT PAYABLE] was incorrectly deducting the Patient Paid Amount
    from the Total Payment Amount in its calculation for the $INS RESPONSE
    column on the report.  The report has been changed to no longer deduct the
    patient paid amount when determining the $INS RESPONSE value.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-install routine was designed to remove duplicate Outpatient Site
 entities from the BPS PHARMACIES file (#9002313.56).  The post-install
 process sets the new (#.1) STATUS field (#.1) in the BPS PHARMACIES
 file (#9002313.56) to ACTIVE for all existing ECME Pharmacy entities
 in the BPS PHARMACIES file (#9002313.56).
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov, 
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific
     server as follows: 
   
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
  The documentation distribution includes:

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Considerations:
  
   1. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated by the BPS
      Nightly Background Job [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job
      to finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
   2. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
      transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
      complete the installation before the transmission starts.
   3. It is recommended that the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build be 
      installed or QUEUED to be installed during off-peak hours to avoid 
      disruptions.  Due to a conversion process performed by the IB*2*342 
      post-install routine, installation time can be quite extensive (taking
      an estimated one to four hours to complete) for those sites that have 
      been activated with the HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL software for more than one 
      month. For those sites that have not yet been activated with the HIPAA 
      NCPDP - GLOBAL software, the installation time will be less than 10 
      minutes.
  
 The conversion process mentioned above will not affect pharmacy and billing 
 operations, therefore, users can be on the system during the IB*2*342 
 post-installation process. However, it is recommended that the ECME 
 Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option be disabled 
 during installation as it may display irregular results if run during the 
 installation process (see item 11 in the installation steps).
  
  
 To Install the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build distribution:
  
 1.  Obtain the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the following
     three patch installs:
       
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, select the Load a Distribution option.
  
 4.  When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", enter the full directory path
     where you saved the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID (e.g., 
     SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID).
  
 5.  When prompted for "OK to continue with Load? NO//", enter "YES."
     
     The following will display:
  
       Loading Distribution...
  
         BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342
  
 Use INSTALL name BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 to install this Distribution.
  
 6.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0")
  
     6.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     6.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
  
     6.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 7. Back in the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option.
  
 8. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 
    1.0."
  
 9. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
    Yes//" for the BPS*1.0*3 build, respond "YES."  For the build IB*2.0*342, 
    respond "NO."
  
 10. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond "NO." 
  
 11. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//", enter "YES"
  
     11.1 When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          Enter the following options:
  
              ECME Billing Events Report  [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
  
     11.2 When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          press <RET>
  
 12. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device or 
     queue this to P-Message.
   
 13. For sites that have already activated ePharmacy functionality, there is a
     post-installation step, which is to check the BPS NCPDP Logical link. In
     most cases, the link will be running (STATE=ENABLED or INACTIVE). If this
     link is not running it will need to be restarted.  To turn on the logical
     link, run the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option located on the Filer and
     Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7
     Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK
     NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP", and when prompted for "Method for running the
     receiver", choose the default of B - Background to enable the logical link.
