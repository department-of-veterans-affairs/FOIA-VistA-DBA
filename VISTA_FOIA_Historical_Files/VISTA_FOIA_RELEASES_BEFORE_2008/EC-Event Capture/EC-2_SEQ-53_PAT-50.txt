 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. MWV-0603-21781     Incorrect date of death
    Duplicate:         LIT-0104-70210  Died on Date in EC-GUI
 2. ATG-0603-31522     EC GUI ADD EVENT CODE SCREEN should Pre-Pop DSS UNIT
 3. ATG-0603-31517     GUI screen focus for Data Entry by Patient
 4. ATG-0603-31516     EC GUI need drop-down calendar for Edit by Pat
 5. ATG-0603-31519     Patient Name Edit box is right justified
   
 
 MWV-0603-21781
 ==============
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Event Capture GUI gives incorrect date of death on warning message for a
 deceased patient. The date of death should be pulled from the date of 
 death field in file 2 rather than remarks since the remarks field is
 free text. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes were made to ECUERPC2, ECBEN1B, ECMUTL1 and ECED1 routines to 
 correct the date of death on the warning message for a deceased patient.
 The routines were changed to use the date of death field (.351) instead of 
 the date of death from the remarks field (.091) in the patient file (2). 
  
  
 ATG-0603-31522
 ==============
 Problem:
 --------
 
 The Add Event Code Screen GUI Form does not default the DSS unit with the
 one selected from Event Capture Management Menu GUI Form.
 The user has to re-select the DSS Unit once entered into the Add Event Code 
 Screen GUI Form.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Code was added to the Event Capture GUI procedure "TfrmECScreenLocation.
 Populate DssUnit" source code to default the Add Event Code Screen GUI 
 Form DSS Unit value to the selected DSS Unit value from the Event 
 Capture Management Menu GUI Form.
  
  
 ATG-0603-31517 
 ==============
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Data Entry by Patient/Edit Patient Procedure Form option, sets the entry 
 focus on Category.  Most sites do not use categories.
 The user recommended that the software check the applicable DSS Unit to 
 see if categories are being used,and if No, that the entry focus be on the 
 Procedure Date/Time field rather than on Category.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Code was added to the Event Capture GUI procedure "TfrmEditPatientProc.
 Form Create" source code to check if the text of the Category edit box 
 is 'No Categories', if so, the Category edit box will be enabled and
 the focus will be set to the Procedure Date/Time field.  
   
 ATG-0603-31516
 ==============
 
 Problem:
 --------
 The GUI Data Entry Edit Patient Procedure and Same Procedure, Multiple 
 Patient forms do not have a drop-down calendar for Procedure Date/Time 
 edit box.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changes were made to the "Edit Patient Procedure" and "Same Procedure, 
 Multiple Patient" GUI data entry forms. The Procedure Date/Time edit 
 box on both forms were changed to TORDateBox to provide the drop-down
 calendar for Procedure Date/Time field.
  
  
 ATG-0603-31519
 ==============
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Enter/Edit Patient Procedures screen in EC GUI, the Patient Name edit 
 box value is right justified, causing the user not to be able to see
 the first characters of the value if length of the value exceeds the size 
 of the text box. The user recommended the value be left justified when
 displayed in the GUI text box so the pertinent info is visible. 
   
 Resolution:
 ------------
 Changes were made to the Enter/Edit Patient Procedures screen. The 
 Patient Name search look-up list box was placed under the "Patient" label, 
 and extend across the screen. The Help text label was changed.
 The help text was changed to "Enter NAME, SSN, Last 4 digits SSN, or first 
 initial of last name plus Last 4 digits SSN". The Help text label was 
 placed under the Patient Name search look-up list box.  
  
 FUNCTIONAL:
 ==========
 
 To access the drop down calendar box, ORWU DT was added to the EC GUI
 Context menu option. 
 This is included in the KIDS build.
