Subject: Update Radiation Exposure Method EAS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released as an emergency with a November 13, 2006
 compliance date because there are several other initiatives that are
 dependent on the release of this project, and because VHA Directive
 2006-048 Verification of Ionizing Radiation (IR) Exposure was prematurely
 released on September 12, 2006.
  
 Note:  This patch is being released along with patch DG*5.3*659
        Ionizing Radiation Exposure Method and Help Text Updates in
        host file DG_53_P659.KID. Please see the National Patch Module
        patch description for DG*5.3*659 for details concerning the
        functionality of that patch, retrieval of user documentation, and 
        installation instructions for the host file build.
  
 In compliance with VHA Directive 2006-048 Verification of Ionizing 
 Radiation (IR) Exposure (Electronic Document/Data Management System (EDMS)
 #328586), the Radiation Exposure Method for veterans should now include
 additional methods that do not qualify them for Enrollment Priority Group
 6. Patches DG*5.3*659 and EAS*1*75 implement this new required
 functionality.      
  
 Issue # 1:
 In the MILITARY SERVICE DATA, SCREEN <1>, for the following options:
  
 Add a New LTC CoPayment Test              [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST ADD]
 Edit an Existing LTC Copay Exemption Test [EASEC LTC EXEMPTION TEST EDIT]
 View a LTC Copayment Test                 [EASEC LTC COPAY TEST VIEW]
  
 the Radiation Exposure Method will now reflect the new codes introduced
 with patch DG*5.3*659. The entire set of codes includes:
 2         Hiroshima/Nagasaki
 3         Atmospheric Nuclear Testing
 4         H/N and Atmospheric Testing
 5         Underground Nuclear Testing
 6         Exposure at Nuclear Facility
 7         Other
