Subject: ADJUSTMENT VOUCHER SCROLLING PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch contains a modified input template that takes care of a "looping"
 problem that occurs when a user tries to do a line item edit within an
 amendment to decrease the quantity on a purchase order (with no delivery
 schedule) via the Amendment to Purchase Order option in the IFCAP package.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy message(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 RIC-0899-20869  HUNG IN PO AMENDING     (Remedy #HD55202)
  
  
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy message(s):
 -----------------------------------
 RIC-0899-20869  HUNG IN PO AMENDING    (Remedy #HD55202)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some sites discovered that when doing a line item edit within an amendment
 to decrease the quantity on a purchase order (with no delivery schedule) via
 the Amendment to Purchase Order [PRCHPC AMEND] option, the user gets hung
 in a loop where the following messages are continuously displayed onscreen: 
  
 Delivery schedule quantity of xxx EXCEEDS order quantity of x. You must edit
 one or more schedules so that the total equals no more than x.  
  
 Line Item # = x
 Quantity Ordered: x
  
 Delivery schedule total of xxx EXCEEDS ordered quantity of x. Adjust
 delivery schedule(s).  
  
  
 ****Returning to Item Multiple session.
  
  
 QUANTITY is less than Quantity Previously Received
   QUANTITY: x//
  
 Because of this, the user is unable to finish the amendment and has to log
 out of their Vista account, go back into the option, delete the pending
 amendment, then repeat the line item edit to finish it. This is caused by
 a logic error within the PRCHLINE input template of the AMENDMENTS file
 (#443.6) which the Amendment to Purchase Order [PRCHPC AMEND] option uses
 in performing the line item edits.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 This patch contains a modified version of file (#443.6) input template
 PRCHLINE.
