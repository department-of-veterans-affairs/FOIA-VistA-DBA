  GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  =================== 
  This patch will provide the ability to 'close-out' a group of
  consult/procedure requests by date range, service and selected statuses.
  The selected requests may be updated to completed or discontinued. In
  addition, a comment of up to 256 characters may be entered once and
  associated with all of the updated requests.  
  
  This function is limited to the user entered in field #123.5 SPECIAL
  UPDATES INDIVIDUAL of the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file for the selected
  service. A user entered in this field will have group update privileges
  for any of the associated sub-services. A user entered in the ALL
  SERVICES entry will have group update privileges for any service within
  the hierarchy.
  
  Included with this patch is the GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE input template
  which will allow editing of the SPECIAL UPDATES INDIVIDUAL field, #123.5.
  
  
  A new option, Group update of consult/procedure requests [GMRCSTSU],
  provides access to this function. This option is part of the Consult
  Management [GMRC MGR] menu. This option will allow a search of the
  database for records meeting the selected criteria and allow a report of
  those records to be printed without performing the status updates. In
  addition, the option allows printing of the records along with the status
  updates. 
  
  The option performs as follows:
  
    RPT    Consult Tracking Reports ...
    SS     Set up Consult Services
    SP     Set up Consult Protocols
