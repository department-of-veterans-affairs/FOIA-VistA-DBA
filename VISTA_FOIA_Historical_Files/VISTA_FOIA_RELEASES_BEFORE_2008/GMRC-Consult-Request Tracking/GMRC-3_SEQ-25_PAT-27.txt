Associated patches: (v)GMRC*3*22   <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRC*3*27'

Subject: Misc. report corrections

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects several problems reported when using various Consult 
 related reports.
  
 Problem 1:  
  
 When running the Consults Brief Health Summary Component, occasionally 
 you will see an UNKNOWN in the Action Date column.  This is most often 
 due to an activity being entered without a time for the activity.   This 
 problem is corrected by this patch. If the problem is not due to a date 
 format problem, the problem will not be resolved until the release of 
 GMTS*2.7*58.
  
 Problem 2:
  
 If a VA Fileman sort is done on the REQUEST/CONSULTATION  file, sorting 
 on the DATE OF REQUEST field, sometimes when choosing from a certain date 
 to LAST, dates will show up at the end that are logically before the date 
 chosen to start with. This is caused by dates with trailing zeroes being 
 committed to the database and indexed as strings instead of numeric 
 dates.  A post-install included in this patch will locate any dates 
 stored as such and will correct them to be stored as numeric dates/times. 
 This will correct any future sorts on the DATE OF REQUEST field. 
  
 Problem 3:
  
 When using the Service Consults Pending Resolution option, if one chooses 
 the Service action to select a different service, the list of choices 
 may not scroll correctly if there are more than 2 partial matches for the 
 input.  This patch corrects this problem by allowing  scrolling to show 
 all choices listed.

 COMPONENTS INCLUDED:
 ====================
 This patch exports the Data Dictionary for two fields in the 
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file. The following fields within the REQUEST 
 PROCESSING ACTIVITY multiple are modified:
  
 .01       DATE/TIME OF ACTION ENTRY
   2       DATE/TIME OF ACTUAL ACTIVITY
  
 The patch also includes the following protocols:
  
 GMRC COMP STAT SELECT SERVICE     
 GMRC OUTSTD CONSLTS SELECT SERVICE
 GMRC QC SELECT SERVICE            
  
   
  
 POST-INSTALLATION:
 ==================
 This patch includes a post-install routine that will detect and correct 
 dates/times stored incorrectly in the DATE OF REQUEST field in the 
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file. The post-install should not be lengthy 
 although the time needed to run is dependent on the number of errant 
 entries being corrected.  The post-install routine (GMRCYP27) may be 
 deleted after successful installation.
  
   
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed at non-peak hours due to the high volume
 use of the routines included. Installation should take less than 5 
 minutes but due to the post-install, it may take longer.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*27):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRC*3.0*27.
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//'
      respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
