Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*55 contains no changes to software
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
  
 DESCRIPTION
 ===========
  
 The LEDI Setup option [LA7V SETUP] fails to add the member S.HL V16
 SERVER@remote mail domain to the mail group used to transmit HL7 messages
 via the MailMan transmission protocol. This occurs when the entry in the
 INSTITUTION file (#4) has an internal entry number which is different
 from the VA Station Number. The software is assuming that the station
 number and the internal entry are the same.
  
 Routines LA7VLL, LA7VSET, and LA7VSET1 have been changed to use the
 internal entry number from the INSTITUTION file when retrieving the DOMAIN
 field from the INSTITUTION file.
  
 The patch also corrects the misspelling of the word "transmissions" in
 routines LA7VSET and LA7VSET1.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   However the following conditions apply:
  
      - The install will disable LEDI Setup option during installation.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel and MailMan patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
       prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
       option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in your
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
       a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   7.  The install will disable the following Lab verifying options during
       patch installation.
  
       LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP]
  
  
   8.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*55'.  When prompted 'Want to
       DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',
       choose 'NO'.
  
   9. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  10. Routine LA55 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
