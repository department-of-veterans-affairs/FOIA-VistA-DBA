Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*109   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*155'

Subject: Updates Consult with Amended Note

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the problem of an amended consult note not being 
 displayed on the consult tab. A clean up utility is provided by this 
 patch that will clean up existing amended consult notes.
  
  
 Problem Resolved:
 =================
 1. The retracted consult note, not the amended note, displays as being 
 associated with the consult on the Consult tab. Consequently, the amended
 note cannot be viewed or printed from the consult tab.
 Solution: A modification has been made to the display the amended note on
 the consult tab, not the retracted note.
  
 2. Because the retracted note is associated with the consult, there is 
 the possibility that the retracted document would print from the progress 
 notes tab instead of the amended note.
  
 3. Sites may have existing amended consult notes that currently display 
 and print the retracted note from the consult tab.
 Solution: A clean up utility is provided to clean up existing amended
 consult notes so that the amended note will display on the consult tab,
 not the retracted note.

 Post Install Instructions:
 =========================
  
 *****************************IMPORTANT************************ 
 A clean up utility needs to be invoked to clean up any existing consults 
 that may be linked to a retracted document and link the consult to the 
 amended document. To run the clean up utility, from the programmers mode
 enter D ^TIUPS155 at the programmer prompt. You may queue this task. A
 report of the updated records will print out.  See below for an example of
 the clean up report. An ^XTMP("TIUP155", global is created which stores
 data on the records being changed in the clean up. The ^XTMP("TIUPS155"
 can be accessed by IRM staff if the Amended Note - Consult Clean up Report
 is not available by other means. The ^XTMP("TIUPS155" global will be
 deleted after seven days.
  
  
 The clean up utility should only need to be run once. The TIUPS155 routine
 can be deleted after the clean up has successfully completed.
  
 There may not be amended consult notes to clean up. If records are found 
 to be cleaned up the consult information will display as in the example 
 below.
