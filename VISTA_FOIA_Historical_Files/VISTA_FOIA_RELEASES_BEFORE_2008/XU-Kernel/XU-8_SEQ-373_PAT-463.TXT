 Patch Tracking #: 46053582
 Test Sites: BAY PINES, FL, SALISBURY, NC, WASHINGTON, DC
 Bank Clearance: 06/28/2007
  
 1) HD194262
 Allows developers to be able to change the defaults on the three most 
 common KIDS install questions. They are:
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
  
 2) There is now a page 5 to the Edit a Build [XPD EDIT BUILD] option that
 allows developers to change defaults (default for these questions
 is 'NO' as requested by sites)
  
 3) Enhances the Print Transport Global [XPD PRINT INSTALL] and the Build 
 File Print [XPD PRINT BUILD] options. The ALPHA/BETA TESTING field (#20) 
 and Default answers to fields (51.05, 51.09, 51.11) of the BUILD file
 (#9.6) are added to display on the report for the options.
  
 4) Creates a new option: Edit a Protocol [XUPROTOCOL EDIT]. Users can 
 use this option to create or edit a protocol.
  
 The post-init routine XU8P463 is deleted after the install is completed.
