Subject: ISO SENSITIVE RECORDS ACCESS REPORT

Category:

  - Print Template

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Directive 6210, VA Handbook 6210,
 Computer Security Act of 1987 (PL 100-235), Office of Management and
 Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, the Health Insurance Portability and
 Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Security and Electronic
 Signature standards require a process and procedure be put in place to
 review and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive patient information.
 Audit requirements mandate a process be in place by which events may be
 reconstructed in case an investigation is required.
  
 The main goal is to ensure our systems, supporting business processes, 
 policies, procedures and practices will successfully meet not only the
 implementation standards and deadlines mandated by the documents and
 standards listed above, but also the expectations of the customers to whom
 we provide products and support. This is accomplished by ensuring our
 systems and information protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
 availability of electronic protected health information and other
 sensitive patient data. Today's approach is manual and accomplished 
 inconsistently, if at all. It is the VA's policy to protect the
 confidentiality of patient's medical information as required under law
 and only to disclose medical information as necessary to third parties to
 carry out other legitimate business activities. It is also the VA's policy
 to restrict access to confidential medical information as much as possible
 and this code would help achieve this goal.
  
 This patch (DG*5.3*666) will create a mail group, DG ISO SENSITIVE RCDS,
 to receive a daily Mailman message containing a list of sensitive patients
 accessed the previous day.
  
 It will also provide reports which readily provide the Information
 Security Officer (ISO), information regarding sensitive records accessed.
 Some of these reports can be easily exported to a Microsoft Excel
 spreadsheet where they can be sorted and analyzed to detect patterns or
 trends in sensitive record access.  This will help simplify the audit
 review process. 
  
 Three new menu options will be created.  The first option, DG SENSITIVE 
 RCDS RPT-TASK, will provide the capability for the report to be run on a 
 nightly basis via a TaskMan background job.  This option will NOT be 
 displayed to the users.  The report extracted from the background job will
 be sent to the users who are members of the DG ISO SENSITIVE RCDS mail
 group in the form of a Mailman message.  The Mailman messages will contain
 information regarding sensitive record access collected from the prior day
 only.  It can be exported to Microsoft Excel for auditing purposes.  It
 will contain the following data:
  
   * Patient Name
   * Date/Time Record was Accessed
   * User Who Accessed the Record
   * User Title
   * User Alias
   * User Service/Section
   * Option user invoked to access the sensitive record
   * Whether or not the patient was an Inpatient or Outpatient at the time 
     the sensitive record was accessed.
  
 The second option, DG SENSITIVE RCDS-EXPORT, will provide the capability 
 to print data collected for the prior day as well as a date range.  This 
 report will print the same data contained within the nightly Mailman 
 message.  It can also be exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for 
 auditing purposes.  This option can be used to report the information for 
 a variety of reasons; e.g., if e-mail was deleted; if the tasked job 
 didn't run correctly, etc. 
  
 The third option, DG SENSITIVE RCDS RPT-FORMATTED, will provide the 
 capability to print the report in a printable format.  This report will 
 contain the following information:  patient name, name of user who 
 accessed the record, title, date/time record accessed, option/protocol 
 used to access the record, and whether or not the patient was an 
 inpatient at the time the record was accessed. Users will be able to
 select a date or date range of information to view.
  
 DG SENSITIVE RCDS RPT-EXPORT and DG SENSITIVE RCDS RPT-FORMATTED
 options are being added to the DG SECURITY OFFICER MENU option.
