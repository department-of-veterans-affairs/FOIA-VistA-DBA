 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD120371              Drug Interaction Alert not showing in CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Drug-Drug Interaction Report does not show if the interaction has
 been inactivated so the user would have to look in Drug Interaction
 File (#56) to check this.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify the PSNACTION print template to add Inactivation Date after the 
 Nationally Entered field.
 Inactivation Date will begin in column 79.  This report will now require 
 132 columns.
 Routine PSNTER will also be modified to add the disclaimer that the
 report will now require 132 columns.
