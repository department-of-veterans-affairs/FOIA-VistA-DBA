Subject: BAD DEBT REPORT AND STATEMENT DISCREPANCY LISTING INACCURATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues. The first issue is regarding the 
 "Bad Debt Write-Off (Plus)" line in the Bad Debt Report not updating
 correctly. The second issue concerns patient balance discrepancies
 that appear on the Statement Discrepancy Listing report even though
 the accounts are actually in balance.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
 1. POR-0501-50335  bad debt
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The issue reported in this NOIS is the result of the Bad Debt Report
    not reflecting the correct amounts at the "Bad Debt Write-Off (Plus)"
    line in the "Allowance for Bad Debt - Tort Feasors (SGL 1338):"
    section. The calculations for this amount were failing to take in to
    consideration the re-establishment of bills. Thus, if a bill was
    written off, re-established, and then written off again it would add
    the two write-offs together and report them in the Bad Debt Write-Off
    (Plus) amount even though the first write-off had been effectively
    canceled by re-establishing the bill.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine RCRJRBD was modified to subtract re-established transactions
    from the write-off amounts. This will correct the inaccurate write-off
    amounts reported in the BAD DEBT REPORT.
  
    It was also decided to add an automatically purged temporary storage
    global to aid in any future Bad Debt Report issues. Each time the Bad
    Debt Report runs, ^XTMP("PRCABDET" will be created with all the bill
    transaction data that went into the calculations of the Bad Debt Report.
    It is estimated that this data will add a maximum of 109 bytes per
    record.  This data will be automatically purged 10 days after the Bad
    Debt Report is run.  The following are the results from 2 of our test
    sites:

       Portland, OR                163,228             12,361,728
  
 2. CIN-0103-40788  STATEMENT DISCREPANCIES
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Patient names are appearing on the Statement Discrepancy Listing report
    [PRCA DISC LIST] even though they are in balance. These names are from
    records which have been merged to other records. As such, they should
    no longer be assessed for discrepancies by this report because the data
    is now in the merged to record.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PRCAMARK was modified to prevent 'merged from' patient records
    from being displayed on the Statement Discrepancy Listing [PRCA DISC
    LIST] report. These records have data stored on the (-9) node in the
    AR DEBTOR (#340) file which is created when two records are merged
    through the patient merge software.
