   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
  
   NOTE: This KIDS install does not place any options out of service
         during the install and no user options are affected.
         If KIDS prompts:
   
         "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
          Install? YES// NO"
         "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO"
         "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
         Protocols? YES// NO"
  
         The site should answer "NO" to all three questions.
             Note: You may not receive all three prompts at your site.  
   
         1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
            This option will load the KIDS package in this message onto
            your system.
         2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they
            should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
         3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on
            your system. You now need to use KIDS to install the
            Transport global.
            On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
            following options:
                Print Transport Global
                Compare Transport Global to Current System
                Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                Backup a Transport Global
         4. Users may remain on the system, but installation should be
            done at off peak hours.
         5. No options need to be placed out of service.
         6. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off peak
            hours and less the 5 minutes during peak hours.
         7. Installation of this patch requires no additional memory
            space.
         8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the
            option 'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'LR*5.2*292'
            and proceed with the install.
         9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should
            be returned to the mapped set once the installation has run
            to completion.
