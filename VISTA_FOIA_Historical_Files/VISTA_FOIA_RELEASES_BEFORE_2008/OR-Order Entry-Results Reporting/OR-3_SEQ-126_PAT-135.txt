Subject: Modifications for CAPRI Retrieval of Imaging Exams

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch provides modifications to support retrieval of imaging exams 
 by Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI). 
  
  
 PROBLEMS
 ========
 When CAPRI attempted to retrieve imaging reports, it was restricted to the 
 number of reports defined in CPRS parameters or the default set-up value.  
 CAPRI needed to retrieve all imaging reports.  A modification was made to 
 allow retrieval of all imaging reports when CAPRI is the application 
 retrieving the data.
  
 This problem was identified when testing retrieval of imaging reports 
 during the development of CAPRI enhancements to support Bureau of Veterans
 Appeals (BVA) and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) activities.
