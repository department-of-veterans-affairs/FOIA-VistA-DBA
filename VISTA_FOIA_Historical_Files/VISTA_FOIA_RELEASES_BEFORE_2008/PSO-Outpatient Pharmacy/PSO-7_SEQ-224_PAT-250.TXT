Subject: Q1 - TALLY PRESCRIPTIONS WITH MISSING EXPIRATION DATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will produce a tally report in the form of a MailMan message 
 for all prescriptions with missing expiration dates and prescriptions that
 are past their expiration dates but have an active status.  It also 
 contains corrections for two remedy tickets.
  
 1.  The tally report will be sent to the person who installs the patch at 
 the site and to management on FORUM via the MailMan utility. It will be
 used to determine if a national patch needs to be created for correcting
 this issue.
  
 During installation of this patch, the user may select to run the tally 
 immediately or queue it to run at a later date and time. Should it be 
 necessary to stop the job for emergency or to know the status of the job,
 a status and stop function is provided.
  
 To stop the job, log into programmer's mode and type the D STOP^PSOTEXP1 
 at the command prompt.  The following is an example:
  
      >D STOP^PSOTEXP1                
  
      TALLY MISSING EXPIRATION DATES Job - set to STOP Soon
  
      Check Status to be sure it has stopped and is not running...
           (D STATUS^PSOTEXP1)
  
 To check the status of the TALLY MISSING EXPIRATION DATES job, log 
 into programmer's mode and type D STATUS^PSOTEXP1 at the command prompt.  
 The following is an example:
  
      >D STATUS^PSOTEXP1              
  
      Currently processing:
      Date being processed > Dec 09, 2005
                      RX # > 3011493
  
 To restart the job, the patch must be re-installed.
  
 The following is an example of the MailMan message that will be sent to
 management and the user who installs the patch:

 2.  Remedy tickets 166505 and 166485 related to patch PSO*7*239:
  
 A.  It was reported that for two sites the CIDC Activity Log Clean-up
 process did not complete, no error was recorded, and no MailMan message
 was received stating the job completed.  It was found that the problem
 resulted from a prescription being locked by another process for an
 extended amount of time which resulted in the CIDC Clean-up process
 stopping.  For consistency in the routines at all sites, the modification
 to correct this issue is being included in this patch.  If your site 
 received the MailMan message stating that the CIDC ACTIVITY LOGS 
 CORRECTION job completed, no action should be taken.  Otherwise after 
 installation of this patch, run the CIDC Clean-up routine from
 programmer's mode to complete the process:
  
     >D ^PSOCIDC7
  
 The clean-up routine will store any prescription that cannot be locked
 for correction.  The completion MailMan message was modified to notate 
 whether such problems occurred.  If there is not a notation stating 
 prescriptions were locked, no further action is needed.  Otherwise 
 from the programmer's prompt type the following to print a report:
  
     >D LOCKED^PSOCIDC9
  
 The prescriptions on the locked prescription report may be individually 
 corrected manually by typing the following at the programmer's prompt:
  
     >D FIXONE^PSOCIDC9
  
 The prescription number will be prompted, and a message stating that the
 activity logs were corrected will be displayed.  If the manual clean-up
 process still cannot lock the prescription in order to correct the
 activity logs, a message stating such will be displayed.  Otherwise, a
 message will be displayed that no corrections are needed.  Each
 prescription completed is notated as such and reprinting the
 LOCKED^PSOCIDC9 report will show "completed" after each one.
  
  
 B.  It was reported that an error occurred when the RPT^PSOCIDC9 report
 was queued to a printer.  This patch corrects the queuing of the report to
 a printer.  To generate the report of all prescriptions affected by the
 clean-up process, enter the following at the programmer's prompt:
  
     >D RPT^PSOCIDC9

      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
