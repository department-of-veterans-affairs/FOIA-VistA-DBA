"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
Person file.  The PDF documentation may also be retrieved from the
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
anonymous directories at Hines, Albany, and Salt Lake City with the

"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)

"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
This patch adds a new file PERSON CLASS (8932.1) with data.  
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
  
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
NOTE: The file PERSON CLASS is in global ^USC.  This will be a NEW global
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
for most sites. Please be sure to place this global and add it to your
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
translation tables.  This is a static file.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)

"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
The patch also:

"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
(2), EXPIRATION DATE (3).
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
Adds the PERSON CLASS field to the following options: Edit an Existing
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
