Subject: FEE REPLACEMENT ENCAPSULATION PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The VistA Fee Basis Package will be replaced by a new application in a 
 phased approach. The new application will be hosted by the Health 
 Administration Center, which is located at Denver, CO. A future phase of 
 the VistA Fee replacement project will have the pharmacy invoices entered 
 and processed using the Fee replacement system.
  
 The Nightly Management Data Compile Job [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE] option 
 is scheduled to run nightly. This option populates the OUTPATIENT PHARMACY
 MANAGEMENT DATA file (#59.12) with cost related data from the PRESCRIPTION
 file (#52), and the local VistA FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE file (#162.1)
 for fee basis patients. Accessing the FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE file
 (#162.1) by Outpatient Pharmacy is provided by Integration Agreement (IA)
 203. With the VistA Fee Basis Package migrating to a new platform, the Fee
 Basis Encapsulation project is replacing IA 203 with IA 4395. IA 4395 will
 provide Outpatient Pharmacy with the fee basis prescription count and cost
 data either from the local VistA Fee Basis file or from the Fee 
 Replacement system. This will isolate the Outpatient Pharmacy from future
 changes as the fee replacement system is implemented. This patch will
 modify the Nightly Management Data Compile Job [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE]
 option, to make a call to the new API, $$RXSUM^FBRXUTL(), documented by IA
 4395 that provides the fee basis prescription count and cost for a given
 date.
 As the VistA Fee Basis Package is moving towards a National database, the
 new API may also return a string value of 
 "-1^exception_number^exception_text", indicating an exception has 
 occurred. To accommodate this exception, this patch will also generate a
 new mail message to the holders of the PSORPH security key. Following is
 an example of this mail message:

 This message will help in the future for a site to manually recompile the 
 missing fee basis prescription count and cost for the noted dates from the
 Fee Replacement system.
  
 Note:
 The Cost of Prescriptions [PSO MGMT REPORT RX COSTS] option and the Cost
 of Prescriptions [PSO MGMT MONTHLY RX COSTS] option, provides the daily
 and monthly prescription cost report. While testing this patch it was 
 observed that the average participating pharmacy prescription cost under
 the column heading "AVG PARTIC PHARM RX", was incorrect and displays a
 zero value even with data present. This patch fixes this problem.

        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
