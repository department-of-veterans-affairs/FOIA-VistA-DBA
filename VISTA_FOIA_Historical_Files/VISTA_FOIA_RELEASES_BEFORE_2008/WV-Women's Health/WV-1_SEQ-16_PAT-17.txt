 This patch modifies the printing of notification letters to check for 
 and use a patient's confidential address, if appropriate. 
  
 Registration patch DG*5.3*489 allows for a patient to specify a
 confidential address to be used for written correspondence. The patient
 specifies the confidential address to use, the timeframe that confidential
 address will be used, and one or more categories of written communications
 that apply.
  
 Notification letters may contain appointment or medical results 
 information. This type of information corresponds with
 APPOINTMENT/SCHEDULING and MEDICAL RECORDS (category 2 and 4 respectively)
 in the Registration package. After WV*1*17, the printing of notification
 letters will check if the confidential address should be used.
  
  
  
 Routines affected: WVUTL9
  
 Options Affected: Print Individual Letters [WV PRINT INDIVIDUAL LETTERS]
                   Print Queued Letters [WV PRINT QUEUED LETTERS]

 Documentation:
 ==============
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1)     The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
         download.vista.med.va.gov
  
         This will transmit the files from the first available FTP Server.
  
 (2)     Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from a
         specific Server as follows:
  
   CIO FIELD OFFICE      FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
   ---------------       -----------                  ---------
