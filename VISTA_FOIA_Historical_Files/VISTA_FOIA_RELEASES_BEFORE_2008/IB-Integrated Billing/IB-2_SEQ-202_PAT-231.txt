Subject: REMOTE INSURANCE QUERY FIX/UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch includes 2 fixes for IB*2*214 - REMOTE INSURANCE QUERY and two 
 enhancements to the Remote Insurance Query software.  The NOIS calls are 
 discussed below.
  
 The first enhancement will store and display the name of the VA Facility
 from which the remote insurance query obtained information.  The
 institution is displayed when processing insurance buffer file entries
 when the user selects EE to expand the entry to display additional
 information.
  
 The second enhancement prevents the use of the remote facility's DATE
 VERIFIED when the date is greater than 180 days old.  This enhancement was
 requested by the IIV project to ensure insurance verification happens if
 it has not been verified within 180 days.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 1.  AUG-0703-30504      Insurance Query - no company name
   
    Problem:
    --------
    The software was attempting to avoid duplicate MEDICARE (WNR) entries 
    in the insurance buffer file.  Instead of not loading in the duplicate,
    the software was removing the insurance company name and still filing 
    the entry.
   
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects the issue by modifying the logic used to determine
    if an entry should be filed in the buffer file or not.
   
 2. MIW-0703-40072      Undef IBZ, BACKGND+34~IBCNRDV
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When the software was trying to resolve the employer claims state data
    element from the remote site, it was using the wrong field to resolve 
    the external state name.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The field number has been updated to resolve the state name on the 2.06
    field of the sub-file 2.321.
    
   
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
    
 1.  Changes were made to the IBCNRDV to include the fixes for the NOIS 
     calls, populate the new REMOTE LOCATION filed of the insurance 
     buffer file, and to not use the DATE VERIFIED field from the remote 
     site if the date is greater than 180 days old.
    
 2.  Changes were made to the IBCNBLE routine to display the REMOTE 
     LOCATION filed when users select the EE (Expand Entry) option while 
     processing insurance buffer file entries.
   
 3.  The new filed REMOTE LOCATION (#.14) was added to the INSURANCE BUFFER
     (#355.33) file.
