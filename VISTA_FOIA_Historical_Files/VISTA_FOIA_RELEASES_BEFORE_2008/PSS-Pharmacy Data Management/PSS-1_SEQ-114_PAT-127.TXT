Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  Below is a list of all the applications
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*260
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*363
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*5
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*127
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*63
  
 The first three patches (BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260) will be
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  Patches PSX*2*63 and
 PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an
 implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution and the
 stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed prior to
 the installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).
 After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the
 site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy
 product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not
 to activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 application as 
 described below:
  
 1. The following fields were added to DRUG file (#50) for determining
    metric quantity for electronic 3rd Party billing:
  
    a.  NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field (#82) - Allows entry of EA for EACH, GM
        for GRAMS or ML for MILLILITERS.
  
    b.  NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER field (#83) - This field contains the 
        number that will be multiplied by the quantity in the prescription
        in order to determine the correct quantity to bill electronic 3rd
        party insurance companies.  Only products with an NCPDP DISPENSE
        UNIT of GM or ML should have a value different than 1 (one) in this
        field. Numbers between 0.001 and 99999.999 are allowed to be 
        entered into this field.
  
  
 2. The two fields above will be auto-populated by a post-install routine,
    which will be executed when this patch is installed. Although the 
    majority of drugs will be updated with EA (EACH) for the NCPDP DISPENSE 
    UNIT and 1 (one) for the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER fields, a large 
    number of drugs will be updated with GM (GRAMS) or ML (MILILLITERS). 
    Furthermore, some drugs will also have a number different for the NCPDP
    QUANTITY MULTIPLIER field. The post-install routine relies on a 
    built-in list provided by the National Drug File (NDF) group that 
    contains the necessary information for the update being performed. 
  
    For a listing of drugs that have been populated with GM or ML, along 
    with the individual changes for each, see the Pharmacy Data Management 
    Drug Exception List located on the VistA Documentation Library 
    (VDL).                               
  
    Once this patch is installed, the user will be able to verify the
    auto-population results by running the following Fileman Print option:
  
  
        OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: DRUG// 
        SORT BY: GENERIC NAME// NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT  
        START WITH NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT: FIRST// 
          WITHIN NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT, SORT BY: GENERIC NAME  
          START WITH GENERIC NAME: FIRST// 
            WITHIN GENERIC NAME, SORT BY: 
        FIRST PRINT FIELD: GENERIC NAME;@  
        THEN PRINT FIELD: NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT  
        THEN PRINT FIELD: NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER  
        THEN PRINT FIELD: 
        Heading (S/C): DRUG LIST// 
        DEVICE: ;;999  UCX/TELNET    Right Margin: 80// 
   
  
 3. For the DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, the PSSCOMMON 
    input template for DRUG file (#50) was modified to allow entry/edit of
    the NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field (#82) and the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER 
    field (#83). The following give additional information on definition 
    and validation of these fields:
  
    a.  When new drugs are defined, the default values for these new 
        fields will be EA (EACH) and 1 (one).
  
    b.  When the NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT is changed from one value to another, 
        the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER will be defaulted to 1 (one) and a 
        message stating such will be displayed.  If the NCPDP QUANTITY
        MULTIPLIER field already contains 1 (one), no change will be made
        nor will a message be displayed.
  
    c.  When a valid value greater than or less than 1 (one) is entered for
        the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER, a warning message will be displayed
        stating that typically a value of 1 (one) should be defined for
        this field.  Then the user will be prompted to continue processing
        thereby accepting the new value or to edit and view extended help
        text for the type of NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT selected. If the user
        elects to ^ (shift six) to exit the "Ok to continue (Y/N)" prompt,
        the system will default the NCPCP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER to 1 (one)
        and give a warning message stating such.
  
  
 4. The LOOKUP INTO DISPENSE DRUG FILE [PSS LOOK] option was modified to 
    list the new NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT and NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER fields
    after the PRICE/DISPENSE UNIT field.
