 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but the Return
 Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option should be put out of
 service during the installation process.  It is suggested that it be
 queued for non-peak hours.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
   
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
      
 2. (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
       for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.

        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
