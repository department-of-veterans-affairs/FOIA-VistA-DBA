Subject: IFC ALERT/ACTIVITY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two problems with alerts received regarding failed 
 IFC transactions. The patch addresses a problem with the printing of 
 IFC activities on the SF-513. It also corrects several problems with the
 activities performed on inter-facility consults.
  
 Issues addressed:
 =================
 1) Prior to this patch, if a sending site has the GMRC IFC ALERT IMMED ON 
    PT ERR parameter set to YES, the IFC CLIN ERRORS group would get an
    alert each time a patient information error occurred at the receiving
    facility. This could lead to multiple alerts with the same information
    if the previous alert had not yet been processed. This patch will
    delete any previous alerts on the same IFC transaction before sending
    any further alerts on the unsuccessful transaction.
  
 2) Prior to this patch, alerts on failed inter-facility consult 
    transactions were being deleted for all recipients when one recipient 
    viewed the alert.  This patch makes a change so that after viewing the 
    details of the alert, the user is given the opportunity to re-transmit 
    the activity, delete the alert for all recipients or delete it for 
    themselves only.
  
 3) Prior to this patch, the detailed display for inter-facility consult 
    activities, showed users entering and performing the activities in the 
    format <first_name mi last_name> whereas all locally performed
    activities had the name format as <last_name, first name mi>. This
    patch will make the user name format of inter-facility activities
    consistent with the local activities. The name format will now be
    <last_name, first name mi>. This will only affect any future activities
    recorded on the system. Current records will remain in the previous
    format.
  
 4) Prior to this patch, if a local consult was forwarded via the CPRS
    GUI to an IFC service, the remote service name was not being stored 
    correctly. If the request was later forwarded at the consulting
    facility, the activity tracking section at the requesting facility
    fails to show the service that the request was forwarded from.  This
    patch will correct the problem of the remote service name being stored.
  
 5) Prior to this patch, some users configured as update users at a 
    service level above an IFC service, were being allowed to update IFC 
    requests sent elsewhere. This only occurred when using the Consult 
    Service Tracking [GMRC SERVICE TRACKING] OPTION. This patch will
    prevent the action from proceeding if the request is being acted upon
    at the requesting facility. No changes are seen in either CPRS 
    interface.
  
 6) Prior to this patch, the SF-513 had no indication of the location of a 
    the user making comments upon an IFC. This patch includes the location 
    of the remote person commenting on an IFC.
  
 7) Prior to this patch, when a comment was made on an IFC by the 
    referring site, the resulting alert did not contain 'remote consult' in
    the text of the alert. To make the text of all comment alerts on IFC
    requests consistent, 'remote consult' will now be included.
