Associated patches: (v)OR*3*110    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*136'

Subject: Radiology Ordering Update

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will fix the potential <nullscr> error that can occur
 when un-verifying a radiology report.
  
 Patch OR*3*110 fixed a problem with releasing Radiology orders from
 hold when the nature of reason required a signature.  As a result
 of this change, when a radiology report is deleted or un-verified
 a null subscript error can occur.
  
 NOIS CALLS
 ==========
  
 NTH-0102-73143     Getting error <NULLSUBSCR>SC+3~ORMRA:2
 REN-0102-62345     Subscript error
 MIN-0202-41682     NULLSUBSCRIPT error in ORMRA
  
 In each of the above NOIS messages, a completed radiology report
 was being altered, which then caused the subscript error.  A change
 to routine ORMRA to account for the status of the order will fix
 this problem.
