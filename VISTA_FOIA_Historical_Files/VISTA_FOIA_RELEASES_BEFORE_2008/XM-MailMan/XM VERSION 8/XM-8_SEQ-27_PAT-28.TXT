Subject: ERRORS SCHEDULING AN OPTION TO P-MESSAGE AND UNDEFINED P-MESSAGE ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When users schedule an option, and queue the output to the P-MESSAGE 
 device, P-MESSAGE will prompt them within the Screen Manager, and the 
 process becomes difficult for the users to decipher.  This also gives 
 the users problems with exiting the prompt that asks for the device.
 This patch also corrects a problem caused by the OPEN EXECUTE
 statement in the P-MESSAGE terminal type created by patch OSI*4*3. 
 After this patch is installed, the P-MESSAGE device will generate an
 undefined error when the user selects a non-existent recipient  to
 receive the report.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ===============
    1. DUB-0604-30440   Scheduling an option to P-MESSAGE
       Problem
       -------
       Screenman (through Kernel) is being used when asking for the device.
       Within that screenman box (the place you enter your device name),
       when choosing P-MESSAGE, a PRE-OPEN EXECUTE is done, which OPENS
       P-MESSAGE IN THAT BOX. This is causing undesired results when
       trying to queue P-MESSAGE. The users are getting some strange
       prompts, that don't seem to be working correctly.
  
      
       Resolution
       -----------
       Routine XMAPHOST has been modified to prevent the problem.
  
    2.  BHS-0704-10389     <UNDEFINED>2~%ZIS6
   
       Problem:
       --------
       When a user who has installed OSI*4*3 attempts to print a report
       using a P-message device and the recipient does not exist, an 
       undefined error occurs in line 2 of %ZIS6.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      This patch will correct the error that occurs by protecting the %H
      variable in EN^XMAPHOST.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the Mailman package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XM*8.0*28):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XM*8.0*28.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted, Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO// respond No.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
