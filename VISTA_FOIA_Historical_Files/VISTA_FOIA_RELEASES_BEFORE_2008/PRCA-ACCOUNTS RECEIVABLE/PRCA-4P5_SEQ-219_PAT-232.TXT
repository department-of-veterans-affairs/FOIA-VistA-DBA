 Interface Overview
 ------------------
 In September 2004, patches, PRCA*4.5*201 and IB*2.0*233, implemented the
 design requirements for a software development project where the Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) established a new set of revenue metrics for
 use in monitoring the performance of the VHA revenue cycle at all VHA
 facilities.  The desired metrics are industry-standard measures that are
 commonly used in other public and private health care institutions.  An 
 existing VHA centralized data warehouse is used to calculate these metrics
 and provides results via a web-based performance metric site.  This data
 warehouse is updated on a monthly basis. VHA's Chief Business Office (CBO)
 has identified the daily collection of this data as a high priority to
 support the metrics development process. CBO needs the daily collection of
 data to populate the centralized data warehouse with billing and
 collections transactions from each VHA facility. The calculated metrics
 would be viewable to field and headquarters staff through an existing
 website.  An automated daily VistA extract would provide more timely and
 accurate data to this centralized data warehouse.
  
 A second series of patches (PRCA*4.5*228 & IB*2.0*301) expanding the data
 collected was released in August 2005.
  
 This patch, along with Integrated Billing (IB) patch, IB*2.0*305, is 
 another expansion of the data collected and transmitted to the Allocation
 Resource Center (ARC).  The IB patch should be installed immediately prior 
 to installing this patch. 
  
 This patch adds 3 new transmissions and additional fields to the existing 
 transmission, and is referred to as Part 2 of Phase 2 of the implementation. 
 This patch adds 3 new extracts to the transmission.  These new extracts 
 will be sent monthly on the 1st of the month for the preceding month.
  
 The new extracts added are:
  
         IB Patient CoPay Account (#354.7) New Extract #1
         ------------------------------------------------
  
             Fields being pulled:
             --------------------
                 SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN)
                 MONTH/YEAR
                 TOTAL AMOUNT BILLED
                 CAP REACHED
                 TOTAL AMOUNT NON-BILLABLE
  
         Pre-Registration Information New Extract #2
         -------------------------------------------
  
             Consists of the following data elements pulled from the
             Percentage of Patients Pre-Registered Report:
             ---------------------------------------------
                 NUMBER OF UNIQUE PATIENTS TREATED
                 NUMBER OF UNIQUE PATIENTS PRE-REGISTERED WITHIN
                    PRE-REGISTRATION TIME FRAME
                 PERCENT PRE-REGISTERED
                 NUMBER OF UNIQUE OUTPATIENTS PRE-REGISTERED PAST
                    PRE-REGISTRATION TIME FRAME
                 NUMBER OF UNIQUE OUTPATIENTS NEVER PRE-REGISTERED
  
         Buffer File Information New Extract #3
         --------------------------------------
  
             Consists of the following data element that appears on the IB
             Insurance Buffer Activity Report:
             ---------------------------------
                 AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS IT TAKES TO PROCESS A
                 POLICY IN THE BUFFER FILE
  
  This patch also makes the following changes to the existing extracts:
  
         e-MRA Reporting
         ---------------
             
             -Total Days Site Not Responsible Due to e-MRA Processing
             -This information will be included on the 399 line of the
                 extract.
  
         Offset Amount
         -------------
             
             -This data is pulled from the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399), OFFSET 
              AMOUNT field (#202).
             -This field will be added to the 399 line of the transmission.
         
         New Bill Status Included
         ------------------------
  
             -The current extracts transmit bills that are in Open, 
              Active, or Suspended status.  The post-init changes the NEW 
              BILL entry in the Accounts Receivable Trans. Type file 
              (#430.3), so that bills with a current status of NEW BILL 
              will be transmitted.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem that was identified with the batch of
 transmissions that was causing currently active  bills to be transmitted
 with the historical transmissions.  The software has been revised to
 screen out these bills.
  
                    Test Accounts
                    -------------
  
 As with the previous patch, PRCA*4.5*232, if this patch is installed in a 
 test account, data will begin to be accumulated and the historical extracts 
 will be setup to run in the test account's TaskMan and sent to the Allocation
 Resource Center (ARC).  The ability to turn this functionality off ONLY in
 the test account has been provided.  It can be turned off and on as needed
 for testing purposes.  Turning this functionality off, turns off both the
 capture of data into the AR DATA QUEUE file (#348.4) and the transmission
 of batches.  Batches created from a test account are ftp'd to a separate
 account at the ARC.
  
                     Post-Installation Notes
                     -----------------------
  
             The current extracts transmit bills that are in Open, Active,
  or Suspended status.  The post-init changes the NEW BILL entry in the
  Accounts Receivable Trans. Type file (#430.3), so that bills with a
  current status of NEW BILL will be transmitted.
 
  
  This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Remedy ticket HD97759    Active Bills appearing in "C" historical files
  
  Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
  ---------------------------------- 
  
        HD97759: Currently  'Active' and 'Suspended' bills are being included
                 in the current FY transmissions to the Allocation 
                 Resorce Center (ARC)
         Note:   Ticket was originally entered for "C" transmissions, but 
                 "E" transmissions replaced "C" transmissions in Phase II.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 The Accounts Receivable software has been modified so that bills with a 
 current status of "Active" or "Suspended" are not included in the "C" and 
 "E" transmissions to the Allocation Resource Center (ARC).
