Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 API UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that 
 will be used by calling applications that currently do direct global 
 reads or writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.  A review of the 
 previously released APIs showed several entry points where additional 
 pieces of data were required to be returned.
  
 If you have already made code modifications, or have made plans to make
 code modifications to use any of the new APIs, please check the latest
 version of the API manual to verify that the API(s) in question have an
 Active status. The API manual has been modified since the original version
 to indicate Active and Inactive APIs. If the API(s) you need have an
 Inactive status, please contact the Pharmacy Re-Engineering team at the
 Birmingham Field Office.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
  from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
  
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PHAR_1_API_R1204.PDF             Updated Pharmacy Re-Engineering API 
                                    Manual
  
  Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA Documentation
  Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
  http://www.va.gov/vdl
  
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Pharmacy users can be on the system while this patch is being installed.
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*91)
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*91.
   
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
   
  8. When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
   
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
