Description:
============

 This patch addresses five problems in PTF.
  
 During site testing it was determined that if you inquire a PTF record 
 the 801 data entered will not be available for display in the INQUIRE PTF 
 RECORD function. This problem has been corrected.  This problem was
 documented in NOIS V15-0804-N1419.
  
 Corrected procedure display on the MAS screen for older procedures entered
 in the 401P nodes.
  
 The 701 input template gets an error in the diagnosis crossreference
 code when refering to a global if the site has added a crossreference.
 The global reference has been changed to correct the problem.  This problem
 was documented in NOIS SBY-0404-30003, SBY-0404-30004, SFC-0404-60494,
 DET-0404-41036 and ELP-0404-72060.
  
 The DGAPI routine was fixed to ignore census records.  This problem was 
 documented in NOISs POR-0504-50054, HWH-0404-40822 and SPO-0404-51497.
  
 The description for PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS (#80) in the PTF file (#45) was changed
 to PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS pre 1986 so it does not conflict with field 79.
 This problem was documented in NOISs BIL-0504-30799, CHA-0504-30842,
 HOU-0504-71602 and HUN-0504-20790.
  
 Data dictionary updates to PTF File (#45) for Primary Diagnosis and Secondary
 Diagnoses 1-9 to provide full scale references in the crossreference
 set and kill logic:
  
 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS  (79)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 1 (79.16)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 2 (78.17)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 3 (79.18)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 4 (79.19)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 5 (79.19)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 6 (79.21)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 7 (79.22)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 8 (79.23)
    SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 9 (79.24)
    PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS pre 1986  (80)

          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
