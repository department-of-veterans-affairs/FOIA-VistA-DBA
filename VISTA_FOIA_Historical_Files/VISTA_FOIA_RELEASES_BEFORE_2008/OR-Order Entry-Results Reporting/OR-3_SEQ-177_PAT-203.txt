Description:

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch 203 is an emergency release to fix problems reported by sites using 
 GUI 22V11 / Patch OR*3*173.  Updates are described below.  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTES:  
  
 1 - All sites which have installed Patch OR*3*173 (a combined Host File 
 release of OR patches OR*3*149 and OR*3*173) should install this patch
 immediately to fix the problems listed below.
  
 2 - All sites which have not yet installed Patch OR*3*173 must install 
 both that patch (OR*3*173 is a multi-build Host File release of OR*3*149
 and OR*3*173) and this patch by the compliance date.
  
 3 - As a reminder, sites testing or using GUI 23 / Patch OR*3*187
 should install this patch and then immediately reinstall the latest GUI 
 23 / Patch OR*3*187 test patch again.
  
  
 UPDATES:
 =======
  
 -- SERVER RESOURCES
  
 - NOIS: CHA-0603-31953, BAY-0903-30560 - Server "Resource
 Allocation" Errors - Functionality added to V22 to match the
 LM version allowed users to set their own date ranges for meds 
 retrieval.  If the date ranges were broad or one or more patients had a 
 high volume of meds history, server resources were being exceeded during 
 retrieval.  To temporarily solve this problem, the individual date range 
 functionality has been removed so that the default date ranges from the 
 Pharmacy package are once again used (how it worked before the 
 functionality was modified to match LM).  The button allowing users to 
 set their own date range is now disabled until subsequent restoration of 
 this functionality, and for now any previously-defined individual
 settings are ignored.
  
 -- REMINDERS
  
 - NOIS: DUB-0903-30932, STC-0903-40585, MWV-0903-20852 - When processing 
 multiple reminders and one or more Reminders has the multiple selection 
 combo box, the user would receive an Access Violation message when 
 clicking either the "next" or "finish" buttons.  The principle cause of 
 these errors was located and remedied.  
  
 -- NOTES, CONSULTS, DISCHARGE SUMMARY, AND SURGERY TABS
  
 - NOIS: FNC-0803-31621 - Several issues have been 
 reported with the TIU document signature process.  
 These include error messages about a document IEN of "0", 
 signed documents with no text, and error messages during the signature 
 process leading to the disappearance of the note.  Also, signing a 
 document other than the one being edited sometimes led to spurious 
 entries in the document tree view.  The signature logic has been 
 substantially rewritten, which should prevent these problems from 
 recurring.  (Patch TIUI*1*174 will allow sites to detect the 
 presence of these types of entries.)
  
 (We are aware that this patch may not fix all "no-text" and "IEN=0" note 
 problems that have been reported.  A certain percentage of these seem to 
 be random and are difficult to duplicate.  Additional repairs are in 
 process and will be released in a subsequent patch.)  
  
 -- PROBLEM LIST
  
 A difficulty was discovered with the lexicon lookup if user preferences 
 for Problem List DISPLAY and FILTERS were set in certain combinations on 
 the server.  The problem only occurs after v22.11 and all CSV patches are 
 installed, and only when a lexicon lookup returns codes for multiple 
 systems for the same search result (ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOMED, etc). This 
 resulted in correct selection of an active code being allowed, but the 
 code was then  immediately flagged by the CPRS GUI as being inactive   
 Routine ORQQPL1 has been corrected to prevent this from happening.
  
  
 REQUIRED BUILDS:
 ===============
  
     OR*3.0*173
  
 OR*3.0*173 is a multi-patch build consisting of OR patches 149 and 173.
  
 NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE4) or later is REQUIRED in order for 
 GUI version 22 to run.  However IE 5.5 or later with 128-bit
 encryption is required for PKI functionality.

 NOTE: The software includes logic contained in a Code Set Versioning
 patch, which is scheduled to be released in the near future.  As a result,
 an error may be generated if XINDEX is run on routines in this patch.
  
  
 INSTALLATION FILES: 
 ==================
  
 The following software and documentation files, including the last 
 file which contains Delphi source code, are exported as part of 
 this patch:
  
    File Name             Contents                    Retrieval Format
    ---------             --------                    ----------------
    OR_30_203.ZIP         File(s) indented below      BINARY
     - CPRSCHART.EXE          CPRS Executable
   *OR_30_203_SRC.ZIP     CPRSChart Source             BINARY
  
 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
