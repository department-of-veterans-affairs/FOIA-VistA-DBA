Subject: Updating ANGIOTEN related allergies

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 In patch GMRA*4*29, existing free text entries were updated in one of 
 three ways.  The entry was either updated to a standardized term, marked 
 as entered in error, or left as free text with the phrase ( FREE TEXT ) 
 appended to the term.
  
 A group of terms that were included in the updated matrix that had the 
 text ANGIOTEN in common were identified as needing to be updated to ACE 
 INHIBITORS.  Of the 19 terms that fell into this group, 6 were correctly 
 identified as needing to be updated to ACE INHIBITORS.  The other 13 
 terms should have been updated to either ANGIOTENSIN II INHIBITORS or 
 should have been updated to free text if the existing term didn't provide 
 enough information to accurately update it to a standardized term.
  
 Prior to standardization, we were aware that there were about 50 
 allergies on file at all sites for the 19 "ANGIOTEN" based terms. In
 addition, the ACE INHIBITORS and ANGIOTENSIN II INHIBITORS are in related
 classes (CV800 and CV805 respectively) which will cause drug class related
 order checks to fire when an allergy to either class is on file and an
 item from either class is ordered.
  
 This patch will find any ANGIOTEN based allergies that were updated by 
 patch 29 and update them to the correct term if need be.
  
 In addition, the post-install will delete and rebuild the "B" 
 cross-reference of the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).  During 
 installation of patch 29, a few sites reported problems with the 
 post-install not completing.  It was discovered that a "B" 
 cross-reference existed for an entry that was no longer in the file.  The 
 "B" cross-reference will be deleted and rebuilt to ensure accuracy.
