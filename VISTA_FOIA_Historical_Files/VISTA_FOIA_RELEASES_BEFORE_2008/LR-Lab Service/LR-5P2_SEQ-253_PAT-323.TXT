 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    Problem:
    --------
 An error message occurs, undefined variable X, at APP+5^LRMIUT1.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
 Place a $G in the code at APP+5^LRMIUT1 [S LX1=$G(X)]. This will 
 prevent the error when X is not initialized.  The routine was already
 doing this 2 lines down, but it appears this set of LX1 was over looked.
