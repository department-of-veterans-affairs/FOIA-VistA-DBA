 (4) After the updates to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file are made,
     the patch performs an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS
     (#720.3) file. Any active EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file record
     which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file record,
     or to an inactive CPT (#81) file record, will be identified.
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user that performs the patch installation.
  
  Example of the MailMan message:
  
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
  
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*81 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
  
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
  
     The National Procedure for the following Event Code
     Screen (500-3-4-245) is inactive or will soon be inactive --
