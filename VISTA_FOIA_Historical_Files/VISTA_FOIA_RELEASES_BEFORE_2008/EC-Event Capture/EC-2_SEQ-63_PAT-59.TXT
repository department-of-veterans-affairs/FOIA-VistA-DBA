 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 ATG-0104-31010  Cannot change Category Use answer after creating
                 DSS unit
 
 Problem:
 --------
 In the Roll-n-Scroll the text description of the Category field (10) in the
 DSS Unit file (724) need to be updated with the following information:
 "Once event code screen(s) have been defined for the DSS Unit the user
 cannot update the category field. If event code screens have not been
 defined then user can edit the category field". 
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A suggestion was made by the user to have the following text added to the text
 description of the Category field (10) in the DSS Unit file (724):
 "Once event code screen(s) have been defined for the DSS Unit the user
 cannot update the category field. If event code screens have not been
 defined then user can edit the category field".
 
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 ATG-1003-31818  Date/Time default for data entry not recognized
 
 Problem:
 --------
 For each DSS Unit, the user can set field DATA ENTRY DATE/TIME DEFAULT 
 (11) in the DSS Unit file (724), to either NOW or NONE. In the EC GUI, 
 When a user does Date Entry, the Procedure Date/Time field is ALWAYS 
 populated with the current date/time even if the default in DATA ENTRY 
 DATE/TIME DEFAULT field (11) is set to NONE.
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 EC GETUSRDSSUNIT (^ECUERPC) broker call was modified to return DATA ENTRY
 DATE/TIME DEFAULT field (11) of the DSS Unit file (724) as the fourth data 
 piece for a user & location.
 
 The DELPHI procedures TfrmPatientProcDE.actAddExecute and TfrmPatientProcDE. 
 actUpdateExecute were modified to add the return value of the DATA ENTRY DATE/
 TIME DEFAULT variable  to  value of the RecordParam variable.
 
 The DELPHI procedures TfrmEditProcPatients2.cboxDssUnitChange and 
 TfrmEditPatientProc.FormCreate were modified to check the value of DATA ENTRY
 DATE/TIME DEFAULT variable. If DATA ENTRY DATE/TIME DEFAULT returns a value of
 "X" then the Procedure Date/Time field will be set to Null. Otherwise the
 Procedure Date/Time field will be set to default date/time value.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will 
 take less than 2 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: Non-peak requirement hours.
  
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*59)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EC*2.0*59.
 
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
  
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
