Description: 
============

 This patch contains the changes to Medicine so the Medicine package will
 conform to the Race and Ethnicity changes in patches SD*5.3*254 and 
 DG*5.3*415.
  
 Please Note:  This patch can be installed without the installation of 
 patches SD*5.3*254 and DG*5.3*415.  Once the two patches are installed
 and the users start to input Race information in the multiple field, RACE 
 INFORMATION (#2.02) in the Patient file (#2), Medicine package will be able
 to obtain the information and display in the appropriate areas.
   
 The following options have been changed:
 
 1)     Add NEW visit/display Patient Background Info. [MCRHBACKF]
  
 This option will display the new race information from field (#2.02),
 if it exists; otherwise, the existing Race data from field (#.06) in
 the Patient file (#2) will be displayed under the caption "Race".
  
 2)     Background Information Print [MCRHBACKP]
  
 The caption "Ethnic origin" was used.  The caption is now changed to 
 "Race".  This option will display the new race information from field
 (#2.02), if it exists; otherwise, the existing Race data from field (#.06)
 in the Patient file (#2) will be displayed.
 
  
 3)     Print All Report [MCRHALLP]
  
 In the Rheumatology report, the caption "Ethnic origin" was used.
 The caption is now changed to "Race".  The new race information, if it 
 exists, will be displayed.
  
 4)     Summary of Patient Procedures [MCARSUMMARY]
  
 For the Rheumatology report only, the caption "Ethnic origin" was used.
 The caption is now changed to "Race".  The new race information, if it 
 exists, will be displayed.
 
 The Pulmonary Function Test report will display the new race information,
 if it exists, with the caption "Race".
   
 5)     Interpretation Enter/Edit [MCFLPFTI]
  
 This option applies the race correction adjustment.  On the Printed
 Report, it displays the patient's race value without any caption.
 The option was modified to display the new race information, if it
 exists, with the caption "Race".
  
 6)     PFT Report [MCFPPFT]
  
 This option applies the race correction adjustment.  It displays the 
 patient's race value without any caption.  The option was modified to 
 display the new race information, if it exists, with the caption "Race".
  
 7)     Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT]
  
 This option applies the race correction adjustment.  It displays the 
 patient's race value without any caption.  The option was modified to 
 display the new race information, if it exists, with the caption "Race".
                                     
 8)    Enter/Edit PFT [MCFLPFT]                                   
       Enter/Edit PFT (Screen) [MCFSPFT]
                                                                   
 If the patient's Race value is "ASIAN", the Enter/Edit PFT options
 do not allow the user to indicate whether the race correction should be
 used.  The prompt "USE RACE CORRECTIONS:" is not accessible by the user.
 The options are modified to allow the user to access the "USE RACE 
 CORRECTION:" prompt for a patient that has a Race value of "ASIAN".
                                                                       
       PFT Report [MCFPPFT]                                                  
       Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT]                                         
       Interpretation Enter/Edit [MCFLPFTI]
                                                                             
 The PFT Reports will use the race correction adjustment appropriately for
 patients that have the race value of "ASIAN".
                                                                             
 9)   Enter/Edit PFT [MCFLPFT]                                   
      Enter/Edit PFT (Screen) [MCFSPFT]
                                                                    
 If a Patient has the race values of both "ASIAN" and "BLACK", there is no
 way to indicate which race corrections should be used.  A new field (#38.5), 
 RACE CORRECTIONS FOR RACE TYPE, is added to the PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS file 
 (#700).  The Enter/Edit PFT options will be updated with the new field prompt.
 If the user answers "YES" to the "USE RACE CORRECTIONS" prompt and the
 patient has both race values, the user will be able to indicate the race
 type at the "RACE CORRECTIONS FOR RACE TYPE" prompt.
                                                                           
       PFT Report [MCFPPFT]                                                 
       Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT]                              
 
 The PFT reports will apply the appropriate race corrections for the
 race type.
                                                                            
 10)   Associate Predicted Value Formulas [MCPFTPVFASS]
                                                                   
 The option was bypassing the field "TLC,VC,FVC,FEV1 CORR.-ORIENTAL" when
 the user entered and edited the predicted value formulas.  This patch will
 add the field to the option.
                                                                           
 11)   Endoscopic Report [MCFPPULM]                                       
       Brief Endoscopy Report [MCBPPULM]
                                                                       
       ASSOCIATED NOIS:   PRO-0103-11706   Endo report error
                                                                         
 An undefined variable MCARGNUM showed up when the Endoscopic Report and
 the Brief Endoscopy Report options under the Endoscopy menu of the 
 Pulmonary menu were used.  This patch will resolve this error.
