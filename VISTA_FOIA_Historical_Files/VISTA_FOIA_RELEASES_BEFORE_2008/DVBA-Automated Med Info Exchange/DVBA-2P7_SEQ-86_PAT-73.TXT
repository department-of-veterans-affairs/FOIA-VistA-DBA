Subject: ALERT USERS TO UPGRADE CAPRI GUI AND MENTAL DISORDERS TEMPLATE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Enhancement ()
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch provides updates necessary to warn users that versions of
  Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) prior to DVBA*2.7*71
  are old and should be updated.  They will still be able to click "ok"
  and continue.  
  
  The patch will also add a new MENTAL DISORDERS (EXCEPT PTSD AND 
  EATING DISORDERS) CAPRI C&P template which fixes references to PTSD 
  in the report text.
  
  BEFORE THE PATCH
  On the psych summary tab, if a user enters data for either of the 
  following two questions:
   1. "Describe the linkage between mental disorder symptoms and 
       aforementioned changes in impairment, in functional state and
       quality of life"
   2. "Effect of Mental Disorder on Social and Occupational Functioning"
  The report text will improperly refer to PTSD instead of Mental
  Disorders.
  
  AFTER THE PATCH
  The report text will refer to Mental Disorders for the 2 questions
  noted above.
  
  This template will be activated as version 95 of Mental Disorders.
  All previous templates will be deactivated.
  Users will need to start a new Mental Disorders template to see the update.

      menu to unload the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  3.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
