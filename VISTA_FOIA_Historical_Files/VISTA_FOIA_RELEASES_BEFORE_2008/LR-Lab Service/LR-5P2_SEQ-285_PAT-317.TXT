 =================
 
 VistA Laboratory Anatomic Pathology (AP) Modifications/Enhancements patch 
 LR*5.2*317 addresses two patient safety issues (PSI) reported in PSI-04-025 
 that arose from the release and implementation of the VistA Laboratory 
 Anatomic Pathology Electronic Signature Patch LR*5.2*259.
  
 The patient safety issues are described as follows:
  
 1. Users that should not be allowed to modify an Anatomic Pathology SF515 or 
 Autopsy Protocol released report are given access to the Modify released
 report [LRAPMRL] option in order to allow the user to add supplementary
 reports.
  
 2. The original Anatomic Pathology SF515 or Autopsy Protocol report is not 
 viewable in the Computer Patient Records System (CPRS) during the time a 
 supplementary report is underway. Personnel are unable to view the report 
 during this time.
  
 The VistA Laboratory Anatomic Pathology Electronic Signature Patch 
 LR*5.2*259 changed the location and the method by which supplementary 
 reports are added. The Modify released report [LRAPMRL] option is used to add 
 supplementary reports to the original report. Laboratory personnel allowed to 
 add supplementary reports to Anatomic Pathology released reports must have 
 access to the Modify released report [LRAPMRL] option. This access opened up 
 the potential for errors in which the report could be accidentally modified 
 when a supplementary report was added.
  
 Patch LR*5.2*317 resolves this problem by removing the supplementary report 
 addition functionality from the Modify released reports [LRAPMRL] option and 
 placing the functionality back to the Supplementary Report, Anat Path 
 [LRAPDSR] option for Cytology, Electron Microscopy, and Surgical Pathology 
 released reports and the Autopsy supplementary report [LRAPAUSR] option for 
 Autopsy released reports.
  
 Another concern had to do with the addition of a supplementary report to a 
 released Anatomic Pathology report, which unreleased the original report and 
 made it unavailable for viewing in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
 The time span in which the original report remained unavailable for viewing by 
 the Providers could be crucial. It was considered a major patient safety issue 
 if a doctor, who was with a patient, was not able to view the report at that 
 time.
  
 Patch LR*5.2*317 resolves this problem by leaving the original report in 
 released status during the time a supplementary report is being added. The 
 original report remains available for viewing in CPRS during this time.
  
 Enhancements to LAB DATA file (#63):
 -------------
 A new field, RELEASE SUPP REPORT MODIFIED (#.03), has been added to the 
 SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT SUB-FILE for the anatomic pathology sections 
 Cytopathology, Electron Microscopy, and Surgical Pathology; and to 
 the AUTOPSY SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT for Autopsy.  The field is a flag, when 
 set to '1', indicates a released supplementary report is being modified, 
 and has not yet been released.

 Overview of NOIS / Remedy Tickets:
 =================================
 
 BRX-0704-11083 / HD0000000070862
 Problem:  Pathologists are complaining about changes in procedure done
 by the Electronic Signature patch. When a supplemental report is added 
 the system un-verifies the parent report. This unverified report becomes 
 available for other Pathologists and transcriptionists to edit it. Before 
 once a report was verified it could not be changed. The Chief Pathologist 
 is very concerned with the legal and clinical ramifications of this change.
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 CPH-0904-40215 / HD0000000070983 - 
 Problem:  Our pathologists are concerned that post patch 259, addition of 
 supplemental reports (additional information) must be added under MM Modify 
 option, thus un-releasing the original report, and necessitating the 
 re-release of both original and supplemental reports.  They feel modified 
 reports should be reserved for edition/correction of previous released 
 reports. They feel this is a patient safety issue.  
 The post 259 options [LRAPDSR] and [LRAPDSS] are redundant when they are 
 operable only with un-released reports.  
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 MIA-0604-31201 / HD0000000070788 - 
 Problem:  According to our lab folks in Anatomic path they used to go in to 
 an option called Supplementary Report, Anat Path to make a correction to 
 the original after it is released.  They don't want to go under the edit 
 modify to reopen the report any ideas on how they can go into the 
 supplementary to attach to the original accession report or something like 
 that.  
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 PRO-0604-10213 / HD0000000070762 - 
 Problem:  Our LAB Service Chief does not want IRM to install patch 
 LR*5.2*259 for the following  Patient Safety, integrity, and additional 
 keystrokes reasons.  For example the Surgical Pathology Reports, the new 
 patch, takes the Supplemental report feature away (ie. For a special 
 stain), it's replaced with a modified report feature, which allows you to 
 make changes to the original report in addition to adding.  Also, while  
 using the  modify report feature, while your in it, it makes the original 
 report unavailable for the Providers to view.  He feels that this is a 
 Major Patient Safety issue, that if a Doctor is with the patient, he won't 
 be able to view the report.  
   
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 SLC-0604-50484 / HD0000000070766 - 
 Problem:  I've just reviewed the NOIS MEM-0504-71296, and we are struggling 
 with the same issues of supplementary reports that they are. (Post install 
 of patch LR*5.2*259).  We currently do not have the electronic signature 
 turned on.  The concern is, that once a report is unreleased, the 
 previously released portion of the report is not viewable on CPRS, and the 
 way we operate here is that the secretaries transcribe the report, and the 
 pathologist signs them sometime later.  We have only had the patch 
 installed for a couple of days, and the path lab has already received calls 
 that reports have "disappeared" on CPRS ... are there any suggestions for a 
 process change that could help with this?  
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 SLC-0604-50594 / HD0000000070769 - 
 Problem:  Post installation of LA*5.2*259 we have encountered the usual 
 problems with any software install that changes the daily routine of 
 workflow, but there is a problem that we feel does affect patient care .  
 We now have to "unrelease" a report prior to adding a supplementary report, 
 the secretaries then transcribe the supplemental report, then the 
 pathologists must review/correct and sign it prior to the secretaries 
 re-releasing the report.  This leaves a window of several hours during 
 which the original report is not viewable on the computer, we have already 
 received calls about "disappearing" path reports.  Our pathologists feel 
 that a supplemental report should truly be regarded as an addendum to the 
 original report, and should not make the original report unviewable while 
 the supplemental report is being processed.    
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
 
 SLC-0604-51082 / H00000000070778 -
 Problem:  We have found a problem with the electronic signature patch.  Our 
 transcriptionist mistakenly selected the field to add a date to the 
 supplementary report field (thru edit/modify), but didn't add text to the 
 free text field.  He was unable to sign a supplementary report (the 
 computer says it doesn't exist), but when he tries to release the original 
 report, it says that the supplementary needs to be released first.  The lab 
 figured out a way to release this, but it is an issue.  
 
 Resolution: The resolution of this issue is contained in the section 
 above that describes the resolution to patient safety issues #1 and #2.
