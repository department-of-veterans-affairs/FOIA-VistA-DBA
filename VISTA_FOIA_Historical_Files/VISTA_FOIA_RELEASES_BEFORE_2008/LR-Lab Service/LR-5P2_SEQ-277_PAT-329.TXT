Subject: CLEANUP PURGED ACCESSION'S UID

  - Routine

Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*329 does
 not contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined
 by VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*329 does
 not alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*329 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 1. Remedy ticket HD0000000088913 reported the Laboratory software was
 creating Laboratory Unique Identifiers (UID) which used the prefix '00'
 instead of the site's two character identifier assigned to each accession
 area. This situation exists when the UIDs from old previously purged
 accessions are still in the "C" cross-reference of the ACCESSION file
 (#68), many from when the UID was first implemented in 1995.
  
 One of the checks performed during UID creation is to check if the UID
 being generated exists in the "C" cross-reference. If it does and it is not
 for the accession being created then the software replaces the accession
 area identifier the site has specified for the accession area and uses "00"
 in its place to insure creation of a unique identifier.
  
 Example: LRO(68,"C",1550180008,25,2950118,8)
 Where: LRO = LRO global
         68 = ACCESSION file (#68)
        "C" = cross reference
  155018008 = UID
         25 = accession area
    2950118 = accession date (Jan 18 1995)
          8 = accession number portion
  
 If the software wanted to assign the normally generated accession UID
 1550180008 to accession area 25, accession date of Jan 18 2005, accession
 number of 18 but found the UID already exist for 1995 accession for the
 same day and number then UID generating software would replace 15 with 00
 to create a UID 0050180008 to allow accessioning to continue.
  
 Note: The UID generating software will always produce an unique number.
 No two accessions will ever have the same UID based on the "C" cross reference.
  
 The routine LROC is modified to check for purged accessions and remove
 purged accession's UID from the "C" and "D" cross reference of the
 ACCESSION (#68) file. This will correct the problem of 10 year
 overlapping accession UID. This routine is invoked by Purge old orders
 & accessions option [LROC].
  
 Note: After installation of this patch the Laboratory software will
 continue to create UIDs using the "00" prefix when an existing accession
 is still currently on the system and using the UID. This is to assure that
 the UID assigned to an accession is unique. The Laboratory software is
 capable of handling UIDs correctly when the UID has a "00" prefix. There
 is no inherent requirement that a specific UID conform exactly to its
 related accession.
  
 2. The check and purge of these cross-references will be tasked by the
 post-install of this patch to cleanup any existing entries in file #68.
 The post-install of this patch tasks a back-ground job to cleanup any
 existing entries in file #68 that have been previously purged. After
 this back-ground job has run to completion, the "C" and "D" should not
 contain any UIDs related to purged accessions.
  
 3. As part of developer review, the Purge old orders & accessions option
 [LROC] has been made 'TaskMan aware'. Stopping of this tasked process can
 be accomplished using standard TaskMan utilities.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 -------------------------
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
         option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   2.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   3.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*329):
         a. Print Transport Global
         b. Backup a Transport Global
         c. Compare Transport Global to Current System
         d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
       Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   4.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*329'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//' choose 'NO'. Responding 'Yes' to the prompt for
       rebuilding menu trees can significantly increase install time.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//
       choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
       During install KIDS will place the Purge old orders & accessions
       option [LROC] out of order.
  
  Note: Routine LR329 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
