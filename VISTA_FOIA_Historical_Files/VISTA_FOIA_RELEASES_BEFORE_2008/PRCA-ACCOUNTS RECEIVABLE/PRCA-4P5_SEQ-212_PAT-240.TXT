Subject: TRANSMISSION AND REFILL DATE ERRORS IN ARC SOFTWARE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixed two errors:
  
    1.  Acknowledgments from the Allocation Resource Center (ARC) are now 
 being processed more frequently. As a result, routine RCXVDEQ was changed 
 to check to see if a batch was closed before adding the bill or 
 transaction to the batch. These bills and transactions were added to 
 "Closed" batches and were never added to a "Pending" batch.
  
    2.  The Chief Business Office (CBO) has discovered that it was not
 receiving the refill date for pharmacy prescriptions in the
 transmissions. Routine RCXVDC5 has been changed to access the correct
 subfield, RELEASE DATE/TIME (#17) in the REFILL subfile (#52) of the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52).

 Post-Installation Notes

 In the post-installation process, a task will be queued to send a 
 FTP file of all active and suspended bills to the ARC.  This task 
 will be queued for 8pm on the date of installation.  The description for 
 this job will be CBO ACTIVE BILLS.
   
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 Overview of HD#125407: After installation of patches PRCA*4.5*228 
                        and IB*2.0*301, sites were noticing that not 
                        all the necessary data was being transmitted 
                        to the Allocation Resource Center for use by 
                        the Central Business Office.  This was caused
                        by transactions being added to closed batches 
                        instead of a new batch.
  
 Resolution of HD#125407: Routine RCXVDEQ was updated to check to see
                          if a batch was closed before adding entries
                          to it.  If it was closed, a new batch was made
                          and the entries would be added to the new
                          batch.  Previously, the software only checked
                          to see if the batch was full or if the batch 
                          was transmitted before making the new batch.
