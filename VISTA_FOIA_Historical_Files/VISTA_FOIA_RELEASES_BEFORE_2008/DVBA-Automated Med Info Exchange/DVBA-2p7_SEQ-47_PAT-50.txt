Description: 
============

 Patch Description
 =================
 This patch introduces (M)UMPs server side changes to the VistA Automated
 Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) module in support of the Compensation
 & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) package.  CAPRI is a Graphic User
 Interface (GUI) for the VistA Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE
 II) menu options.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to prevent CAPRI users from running older,
 unsupported versions of CAPRI.  Users still using older versions of CAPRI
 could potentially create duplicate patients into the system due to a 
 known glitch in the software.  This patch will prohibit older versions of 
 the CAPRI GUI from accessing VistA.
  
 FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
 ===================
 The CAPRI Project is a One VA cooperative effort with the objective of
 creating, testing, and nationally implementing a graphical user interface
 to enhance the retrieval and dissemination of data from VistA AMIE II menu
 options.  This patch will install modifications to the VistA server
 portion.  No new or enhanced functionality to the VistA roll-n-scroll AMIE
 II options are introduced in this patch.  The changes only affect the
 CAPRI GUI.
  
 TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
 ====================
 Routine DVBAB1 has been modified to disallow GUI versions prior to 
 DVBA*2.7*41 from accessing VistA.  This will become active immediately at 
 install.  Users who have an old, unsupported GUI version will receive a 
 message stating that they need to update to the newest GUI.  Veterans
 Benefits Administration IRM departments have previously been provided
 version DVBA*2.7*42C of the CAPRI GUI.  Users should be directed to their
 IRM department for assistance should this issue arise.  In addition, this
 version of the software is available on VHA OI FTP servers for VAMROC's.
