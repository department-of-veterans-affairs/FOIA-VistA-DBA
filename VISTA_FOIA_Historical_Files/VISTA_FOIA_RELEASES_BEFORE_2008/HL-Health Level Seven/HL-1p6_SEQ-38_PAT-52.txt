Subject: HL7 Journaling Recommendation

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This patch is to notify sites of changes to the HL7 Technical Manual with
 regards to journaling of globals.
  
 Page 24, under 'Globals' it states:
   "The globals ^HL, ^HLCS, and ^HLMA are the globals for DHCP HL7 V1.6.
   It is recommended that all of these globals be journaled."
  
 We are now recommending the following change:
   "The globals ^HL, ^HLCS, and ^HLMA are the globals for DHCP HL7 V1.6.
   It is recommended that only ^HL and ^HLMA be journaled."
