Subject: TIU Fix for PSI-04-016

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses PSI-04-016 when an edited note does not get saved 
 properly causing the original text along with the edited text to be lost.
  
 The loss of both the original and edited text could occur when there was a 
 timeout between the CPRS GUI and the VistA server or a temporary loss of 
 connectivity between the server and client.
  
 TIU will now preserve the original note text (stored in the "TEXT" node of 
 the document) throughout the entire edit process until the CPRS GUI has 
 confirmed and sent all the text data to TIU.  In the event of a timeout or 
 lost connection, TIU will maintain the "TEXT" node ensuring the original 
 document remains intact.
  
 TIU's edit/save action for documents in the CPRS GUI will behave in the 
 following manner:
  
     NEW documents -- if the first save attempt fails for any reason, the
                      "TEMP" node will contain all text up to the 
                      point when the transmission error occurred.  The
                      text in the "TEMP" node will be automatically loaded
                      into the "TEXT" node on the next view or edit action.
  
     EXISTING documents -- "TEXT" node will contain everything that was
                           included in the last successful save or autosave.
                           "TEMP" will maintain all included changes up to
                           the point when the transmission error occured.
                           Users may contact IRM to get assistance with
                           recovering the text stored in the "TEMP" node.
  
 If an unknown error occurs, TIU will capture error data that will be 
 temporarily stored in ^XTMP("TIUERR" - maximum of 100 occurrences for up 
 to 90 days.  This information is helpful for developers to determine the 
 cause of the error.
  
 The captured data will include:  Current Date and Time, Error Code sent by 
 TIU, DUZ of current user, TIU Document Number, TIU Header Information and 
 Broker Header Information.
  
 This patch also addresses ClearQuest #7587:  Remote procedure TIU PERSONAL 
 TITLE LIST is returning one extra item in the list if the user has a default 
 title assigned.
