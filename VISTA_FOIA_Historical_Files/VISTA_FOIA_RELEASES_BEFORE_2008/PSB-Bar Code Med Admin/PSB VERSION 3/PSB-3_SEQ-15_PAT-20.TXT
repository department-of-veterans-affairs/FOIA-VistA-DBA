Subject: MAH GREATER THAN ONE PAGE HAS NO HEADER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address two issues:
  
 1.  When the Medication Administration History report is activated for a
 patient that has had multiple entries in the Activity field (#29) of the
 Pharmacy Patient file (#55), causing a second page to be printed, the
 second page does not include a header which is causing some confusion.
  
 2.  In some cases, when the Patient select (read only) button is selected 
 from the tool bar and the user enters the patients Social Security 
 Number (SSN), if the patient is not found, an error message is 
 received which halts the process and forces the user to log off and log
 back onto the BCMA software.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem 1: HD91869
 When the Medication Administration History report is activated for a
 patient that has had multiple entries in the Activity field (#29) of the
 Pharmacy Patient file (#55), causing a second page to be printed, the
 second page does not include a header which is causing some confusion.
  
 Solution:
 The only change that will be made to the Medication Administration
 History Report is that when a patient's Administration report extends
 beyond one page, "***Continued on Next Page***" will print on the bottom
 of the initial page, a new header will precede the data on the following
 page and the data section of the report will be preceded by "***Continued
 from Previous Page***"
  
  
 Problem 2: HD99958
 In some cases, when the Patient select (read only) button is selected 
 from the tool bar and the user enters the patients Social Security 
 Number (SSN), if the patient is not found, an error message is 
 received which halts the process and forces the user to log off and log
 back onto the BCMA software.
  
 Solution:
 Instead of an error, the user will now see the following message: "No 
 patients matching 'SSN'" and the user will be able to continue their 
 search for the patient.
