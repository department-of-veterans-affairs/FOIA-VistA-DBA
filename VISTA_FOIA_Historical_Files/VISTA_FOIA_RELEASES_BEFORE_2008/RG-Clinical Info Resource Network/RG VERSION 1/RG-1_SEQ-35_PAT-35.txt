Subject: REMOVE 'TEST' PATIENT SCREEN - MPI CHANGES ITERATION 2

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  DG*5.3*589, RG*1.0*32, and RG*1.0*34 are required builds for
  patch RG*1*35.
     
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  This patch is for the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
  (MPI/PD) Changes Iteration 2 project.
   
  Issue 1:  When the UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3 [VAFC BATCH UPDATE]
  job runs, it triggers the building of the Health Level Seven (HL7)
  version 2.4 messages IF the patient is not a "Test" patient.  Routine
  RGADTP has been modified to remove the screen for "Test" patients,
  thereby allowing these messages to be sent to the Master Patient
  Index (MPI) for ICN assignment.
   
  Issue 2:  Patients with last names that begin with "ZZ" or "Merging"
  are now sent to the MPI for ICN assignment.  The MPI/PD Exception
  Purge [RG EXCEPTION PURGE] option has been changed so that it no
  longer removes these patients from the purge.  Patients who have
  been successfully merged (i.e., -9 node exists) are removed during
  the purge.
