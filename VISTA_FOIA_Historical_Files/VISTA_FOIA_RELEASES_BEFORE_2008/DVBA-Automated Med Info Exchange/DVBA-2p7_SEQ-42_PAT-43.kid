"RTN","DVBCWME3",100,0)

 ;;    1. The Diagnosis must conform to DSM-IV and be supported by the findings
"RTN","DVBCWME3",102,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME3",103,0)
 ;;    2. If the diagnosis is changed, explain fully whether the new diagnosis
"RTN","DVBCWME3",104,0)
 ;;       represents a progression of the prior diagnosis or development of a new
"RTN","DVBCWME3",105,0)
 ;;       and separate condition.
"RTN","DVBCWME3",106,0)
 ;;    3. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible

"RTN","DVBCWME3",112,0)
 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
"RTN","DVBCWME3",113,0)
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to
"RTN","DVBCWME3",114,0)
 ;;or is caused or aggravated by a primary service-connected disorder, the  
"RTN","DVBCWME3",115,0)
 ;;veteran may be entitled to compensation.  See Allen v. Principi, 237 F.3d
"RTN","DVBCWME3",116,0)
 ;;1368, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  Therefore, it is important to determine the
"RTN","DVBCWME3",117,0)
 ;;relationship, if any, between a service-connected disorder and a disability
"RTN","DVBCWME3",118,0)
 ;;resulting from the veteran's alcohol or drug abuse.  Unless alcohol or drug
"RTN","DVBCWME3",119,0)
 ;;abuse is secondary to or is caused or aggravated by another mental disorder,
"RTN","DVBCWME3",120,0)
 ;;you should separate, to the extent possible, the effects of the alcohol or
"RTN","DVBCWME3",121,0)
 ;;drug abuse from the effects of the other mental disorder(s).  If it is not
"RTN","DVBCWME3",122,0)
 ;;possible to separate the effects in such cases, please explain why.

 ;;NOTE:  The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be required
"RTN","DVBCWME3",127,0)
 ;;by BVA REMAND or specifically requested by the rating specialist. If so,
"RTN","DVBCWME3",128,0)
 ;;include the GAF score and note whether it refers to current functioning.
"RTN","DVBCWME3",129,0)
 ;;A BVA REMAND may also request, in addition to an overall GAF score, that a
"RTN","DVBCWME3",130,0)
 ;;separate GAF score be provided for each mental disorder present when there are
"RTN","DVBCWME3",131,0)
 ;;multiple Axis I or Axis II diagnoses and not all are service-connected.
"RTN","DVBCWME3",132,0)
 ;;If separate GAF scores can be given, an explanation and discussion of 
"RTN","DVBCWME3",133,0)
 ;;the rationale is needed. If it is not possible, an explanation as to why not is
"RTN","DVBCWME3",134,0)
 ;;needed. (See the above note pertaining to alcohol or drug abuse.)

 ;;    2. If there are multiple mental disorders, delineate to the extent possible

 ;;       the symptoms associated with each and a discussion of relationship.
"RTN","DVBCWPD5",41,0)

 ;;for a disability that is a result of the veteran's own ALCOHOL OR DRUG ABUSE.
"RTN","DVBCWPD5",46,0)
 ;;However, when a veteran's alcohol or drug abuse disability is secondary to

 ;;     (e.g., substance use disorders) are independently responsible for
"RTN","DVBCWPD5",114,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPD5",115,0)
 ;;     not possible, explain why (e.g., substance use had onset after PTSD

"RTN","DVBCWPD5",117,0)
 ;;   - If possible, describe pre-trauma risk factors or characteristics that
