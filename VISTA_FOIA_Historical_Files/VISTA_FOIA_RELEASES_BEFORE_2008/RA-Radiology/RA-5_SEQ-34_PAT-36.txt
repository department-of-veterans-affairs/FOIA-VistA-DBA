Associated patches: (v)RA*5*31     <<= must be installed BEFORE `RA*5*36'

Subject: RADIOLOGY-CPRS API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will provide the API needed for the CPRS GUI Report Tab's new
 tree-view for "Imaging (local only)".  The corresponding CPRS patch number
 is OR*3*149.  Patch OR*3*149 and this patch do  not  have to be installed
 at the same time; however the new tree view will not be displayed until
 both patches are installed.
  
 1.  Routines RAO7PC1 and RAO7PC1A have been changed to return 2 more 
     items.  The items will be stored in the first 2 pieces of a new global
     node, ^TMP($J,"RAE1",Patient IEN, Exam ID,"CPRS").  This node is
     returned only if the case is part of a printset that is supposed to
     share a single report.  The first piece is the case's MEMBER OF SET
     value.  The second piece is the exam's ordered procedure name.
  
     DBIA #2043 will be updated to reflect the above changes.
  
 2.  The same two routines have also been changed to return cancelled 
     cases only if the following 3 conditions are met:  input parameter
     RACINC is "1", the exam's division's ALLOW RPTS ON CANCELLED CASES? is
     "Y", and the case has a report.
  
     Previously, when CPRS GUI calls this API, all cancelled cases are 
     returned.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  The install time for this patch is less than two minutes.  Since there
  are frequently used routines included, this patch should be installed
  when all Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load

      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
 message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
 backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
 allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
 installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
 templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
 to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
 global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*36.

        YES//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options
        and Protocols? YES//", respond YES.
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
           RA*
   
  5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*36).
  
  6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
