Subject: DUPLICATE DRUG CLASS CHECK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. When Outpatient Pharmacy and Inpatient Medication orders are entered
 through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), certain order checks
 are performed by Pharmacy during this process. One of the order checks is
 the duplicate drug class order check. The software is currently looking
 for an exact match of the 5 characters that make up the drug class. It
 should only look for a match of the first 4 characters. This patch
 corrects the problem. This patch will also resolve any similar duplicate
 drug class order check problems with Inpatient Medication orders entered
 through Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch should be installed at a time when medication orders are not 
  being entered or acted upon in Outpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient
  Medications, and CPRS. The medication order entry process of all three of
  these packages invokes the routine in this patch. Installation of this
  patch should take less than one minute.
  
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*134)
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*134
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
