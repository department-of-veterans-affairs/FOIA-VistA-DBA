Subject: EXPANDING OF CLASS TREES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch changes the way user classes are expanded and contracted.
 The expand/collapse function now expands/collapses selected classes
 similar to the way Windows Explorer expands/collapses directory trees.
  
 A class that has subclasses and therefore can be expanded will be
 preceded by a "+" in the class display. A class that is currently expanded
 and can be collapsed will be preceded by a "-" in the class display.
 To facilitate implementation of the "+" "-" scheme a screen was added
 to the DISPLAY NAME field of file #8930 to prevent "+" or "-" from
 being used in the DISPLAY NAME.

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take
 less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 4. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (USR*1.0*7)
  
 5. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'YES'. When prompted to select the
    options and protocols you would like to place out or order, enter USR*
    in each case.
  
 6. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  
 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1. Routine:  USRCLASS
 Added a prompt so the user selects which class to expand or contract.
  
 2. Routine:  USRCLST
    List Template:  USR DEFINE CLASSES
 Changed the formatting of the list in ^TMP("USRCLASS") so that the "+"
 will always be in column 6. The list template was changed to allow a
 column for the "+" instead of shifting the name in one column.
  
 3. Routines:  USRCLASS,USRECCL
 Made extensive changes to handle expansion. A new routine USRECCL was
 created.
  
 4. Routine:  USRL
    DATA DICTIONARY:  FILE #8930
 Changed the screen on 8930,.04 DISPLAY NAME to use  $$VCLDN^USRL(NAME).
 This function checks for length and won't allow "+" or "-" in the name. 
  
 5. Protocol:  USR CLASS ACTION EXPAND SUBCLASSES
 Changed the item text from Expand/Collapse Tree to Expand/Collapse Class.
  
 6. Routines:  USRCLST
 Newed the variable CLASSABB. This was not previously done.
  
 7. Routines:  USRCLASS,USRMEMBR,USRUMMBR
 Newed the variable USRCREAT. This was not previously done.
  
 8. Routine:  USRLM
 Newed the variable USRNDX. This was not previously done.
  
 9. Routine:  USRPROV
 Newed the variable USRNOW. It was not previously done.
  
 10. Routine:  USRRUL1
 Replaced the version of PICK with the PICK from TIULM. This seems to
 work like it should highlighting selected items.
  
 11. Routines: USRCLST,USRRUL,USRRUL1
 Deleted the entire routine, USRECLST since the class expansion method
 has been entirely changes. Removed ^TMP("USRCLASS",$J,"PICK") from
 USRCLST. Replace the "PICK" node with the "IDX" node in USRRUL,USRRUL1.
  
 12. Routine:  USRECLST
 This routine was deleted since it is no longer used.
  
 13. Routine:  USRCLST
 When a class is edited it is bolded to show that a change has taken
 place. If a class is deleted then the list is rebuilt the entry that now
 corresponds to the number of the class that was deleted is bolded. This
 is confusing. This behavior is changed so the new line corresponding to
 the old number is no longer bolded.
  
 14. Routines:  USRCLASS,USRL,USRCLST
 Remove references to ^TMP("USREXP") since it is no longer used.
  
 15. Routine:  USRRUL1
 Added a set of VALMBG, in entry point PICK, to the most recently
 selected item-5 so the display will be move to the item.
  
 16. Option: USR EDIT BUSINESS RULES          Edit Business Rules
 A poll was taken, Forum message # 26843847, about retaining or deleting
 this option. The vote was unanimous to delete it.
