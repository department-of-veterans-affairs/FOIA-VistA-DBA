Description: 
============

  
     ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
     
     This patch applies ONLY to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
     EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines).
    
     Please provide a copy of this patch Description to your local
     DSS Site Manager.  
      
     ****************************************************************
  
  This enhancement patch implements a Prosthetics Extract into the DSS
  system.  It includes two new options, a new mail group, changes to
  existing menus, a new file and changes to existing files.
  
  
  New Options and affected menus:
  ------------------------------
  
  1) The following option has been added to the Package Extracts menu
  [ECXMENU].  It implements the DSS Prosthetics extract.  The user is
  prompted to enter a Prosthetics division and a date range to extract. 
  In order for a user to extract a respective division, the division must
  be defined for the user's entry in the NEW PERSON file (#200).  Only
  primary divisions defined in the Prosthetics Site Parameters file (#669.9)
  may be selected by a user that has those divisions defined in their NEW
  PERSON file entry.  Like other DSS extracts, the user may not extract a
  date range outside of a single month.
  
      ECXPRO          Prosthetics Extract
  
  
  - Messages generated:
      'Prosthetics EXTRACT FOR DSS'
     and
      'Prosthetics DSS Extract HCPCS Cost Report'
  
  Upon completion of the Prosthetics Extract option, the user will receive a
  'Prosthetics EXTRACT FOR DSS' message indicating the date range, division
  and number of records extracted.  Additionally the user will receive a
  HCPCS Cost Report message.  This message will include two parts, a date
  range report and year to date report.  Each section will report the HCPCS
  number and Code, the Total quantity of prosthetic items provided, total
  cost, average cost, average laboratory labor cost, average laboratory
  material cost and average laboratory combined cost.  These totals will be
  grouped by their respective Prosthetics AMIS Grouper number for the date
  range section of the report.  Components making up a prosthetics AMIS
  Grouper are separated by a blank line.  The year to date report will
  include the HCPCS number and code, the total quantity of prosthetic items
  provided, total cost, average cost, average laboratory labor cost, average
  laboratory material cost and average laboratory combined cost from Oct 1
  of the current fiscal year until the end date.  The year to date report
  will not separate HCPCS by AMIS Grouper, however.  The date range section
  of the report will be for that date range that was extracted.
  
  
  - Message generated:
     'Prosthetics DSS Exception'
  
  Finally, if any Prosthetics records could not be extracted because key
  information was missing, the user will receive a Prosthetics DSS exception
  message.  This message will indicate the records' Internal Entry Number
  in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660) and the critical
  information that is missing from that record.  The records identified in
  this message were not extracted and should be reviewed to determine if
  they must be corrected and the extract regenerated to assure proper credit
  is received in DSS.  The key information that is required to extract a
  prosthetics record follows:
  
         STATION
         PATIENT NAME (In Prosthetics)
         SSN
         NAME (In Patient file - #2)
         DELIVERY DATE
         TYPE OF TRANSACTION
         SOURCE
         HCPCS
         REQUESTING STATION
         FORM REQUESTED ON
         RECEIVING STATION
  
  The IEN indicated in this message is the Key to finding it in the
  Prosthetics source file (#660).  These IENs can be used with a FileMan
  Inquiry into the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE (#660) with a
  forced lookup (I.E. entering reverse apostrophe and the IEN number -
  `12345) on the IEN indicated in the message to provide details of the
  rejected record.  Considerations are, (1) were there enough records
  NOT extracted to warrant correction and re-extraction and (2) why wasn't
  the missing information entered in the first place.
  
  
  - Prosthetics Site Parameters file (#669.9) 'Heads up':
  
  NOTE:  Some of the test sites for this patch had a corrupted "C" cross-
  reference on the Prosthetics Site Parameters file (#669.9).  It is
  recommended that ^RMPR(669.9,"C") be checked by IRM Prosthetics staff
  to verify that this cross-reference correctly identifies the STATION
  that is associated with each entry in the Prosthetics Site Parameters
  file.  If this cross-reference is found to be corrupted, it is suggested
  IRM Prosthetics staff re-index this cross reference after verifying
  the proper procedure for re-indexing with Prosthetics National Vista 
  Support.
  
  
  2) The following option has been added to the Extract Audit Reports Menu
  [ECX SOURCE AUDITS].  This option will report the HCPCS exactly as the
  HCPCS Cost bulletin created by the Prosthetics Extract option, however
  the user will be able to enter the date range to report.
  
      ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT        Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit
  
  
  3) The following options have been modified to implement divisional
  functionality.  Because the Prosthetics extract must allow users from
  different divisions to extract, transmit and purge a sites extracts,
  the Purge and Transmit options have been changed to check the division
  of the user attempting to complete their functions.  Users must have
  the division defined for the extract in the DSS EXTRACT LOG file (#727)
  also defined in their NEW PERSON (#200) file entry in order to either
  Purge or Transmit an extract.  If the user can not purge or transmit 
  an extract, check the divisions defined for the user in the users'
  New Person file (#200) entry.
  
      DSS EXTRACT LOG             Purge Data from Extract Files
      ECXTRANS                    Transmit Data from Extract Files
  
  
  New and changed files:
  ---------------------
  
  The PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826) has been added to the DSS system.
  This file holds the Prosthetic extract information so the DSS Site Manager
  may review the data prior to transmitting it to the DSS system in Austin.
  The documentation contained in the Data Dictionary for this file provides
  details for the information contained and its source.
  
  The DSS EXTRACT LOG file (#727) has a new field added.  The field is the
  DIVISION field (#15).  This field is used to implement the Prosthetics
  Divisional functionality.
  
  The DSS EXTRACTS file (#728) has two new fields added.  One field is a 
  multiple field and is named LAST DATE PROSTHETICS (#59).  This Multiple
  contains two subfields.  The .01 field is DIVISION and the 2nd field is
  LAST DATE (#1).  There will be an entry in this file for each Prosthetics
  Primary division that is extracted.  The LAST DATE field will indicate the
  last date that data was extracted for that prosthetics division.  The DSS
  EXTRACTS file (#728) also has had the PROSTHETICS field (#60) added.
  This field is used to indicate if any prosthetics extracts are currently
  in process.
  
  
  New Mail Group:
  --------------
  
  The DSS-PRO mail group will be added with this enhancement patch to allow
  the site to identify the users that should receive the Prosthetics extract
  bulletins.
  
  
  Documentation:
  -------------
  
  Documentation for this patch will be included with the DSS Fiscal
  Year 1999 software update.  This documentation is available at
  the CIO Field Offices' ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories.  These files
  may be obtained using FTP capability.  The documentation can be
  read via the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser program.  The .PDF files
  are binary files and must be transported appropriately with binary
  file transfer tools.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  IRM should check
  with the DSS Site Manager (or check the list of queued background jobs
  in TaskManager) to be sure that DSS Extracts application-related jobs 
  have not been queued to run while this installation is taking place.
  
   NOTE:  This patch distribution will check for installation of the DSS
          EXTRACTS patch ECX*3*2 and the Kernel patch XU*8*97 at your site
          before allowing the patch to be loaded.
  
          Also, sites that have installed XU*8*81:
            KIDS will attempt to rebuild all user menus.  If you are
            running this install interactively, you will be prompted to
            rebuild the menus.  If you are not installing interactively,
            KIDS will rebuild menus immediately after the installation
            completes.  It is suggested the installation be queued to run
            at a time of low system activity to accommodate the menu
            rebuild.
  
          CAUTION:  Sites that have set up their Prosthetics system to
          be the repository for other Primary Divisions (the New York
          City model) should NOT install this patch a 2nd time until all
          previous PROSTHETICS extracts have been purged.  The Post-Init
          updates the DSS EXTRACT LOG file (#727) Division field (#15) with
          the division defined in the DSS Extracts file.  Installing this
          patch a 2nd time at sites running the NYC model will corrupt the
          Division field for the Prosthetics extracts.  It is recommended
          that sites contact National Vista Support before installing this
          patch in production more than once.
  
  
  Installation will take less than 15 minutes.  
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*9):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*9.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'DSS-PRO':',
      respond with the DSS Site Manager or other individual responsible
      for populating and managing the DSS system Mail Groups.
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
               Extract Manager's Options         [ECXMGR]
               Extract Audit Reports Menu        [ECX SOURCE AUDITS]
               Package Extracts                  [ECXMENU]
  
  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  9.  Inform the DSS-PRO Mail Group coordinator that the mail group needs
      to be populated with DSS personnel responsible for the DSS Prosthetics
      extracts.  Also inform the DSS Site Manager that users executing,
      transmitting or purging Prosthetics extracts must have the Primary
      divisions they are extracting set up in their user definition in
      the New Person file (#200).
  
      NOTE:  Prosthetic Service staff may want to be included in the
             DSS-PRO Mail Group as the HCPCS Cost Report may be of interest
             to members of that office.
  
 10.  Delete the Post-Init routine ECX3P9PT.
