 This patch checks PDX requests from remote sites to ensure that the remote
 site is not flagged as Closed in the Domain file.  If the Domain file shows
 that the site is closed, then the request is ignored, the message is
 deleted from the server basket, and a message is sent to the members of the
 group G.VAQ PDX ERRORS to inform them of this.

 This patch ensures that incoming PDX messages are deleted from the server
 basket, whether they processed successfully or errored out.
