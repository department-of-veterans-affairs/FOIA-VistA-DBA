Description:
============

 This patch will add another measure of timeliness to the Radiology 
 application.  This new measure will calculate elapsed days from the Date 
 Desired of the ordered procedure to the Examination Date of the procedure.
  
 Thus, after the installation of this patch, there will be two measures of
 timeliness :
     (1) from Exam Date/Time to Report Transcribed Date/Time 
         and from Exam Date/Time to Report Verification Date/time,
     (2) from Desired Date to Exam Date                            <-- new
  
 ------------
 Menu Changes
 ------------
 This new measure will be displayed in a summary report and a detail 
 report that are generated from one option.  There are no additional data
 entry, mail groups, nor background task jobs required to generate these
 reports.  The option and sub-menu to invoke these reports will be new.  
 The current Performance Indicator menu will be deleted and its 3 options
 will be moved under a new sub-menu, "Verification Timeliness".

 The 'Performance Indicator' [RA PERFORMIN MENU] option will be 
 automatically deleted by the installation process.
  
 ---------------
 Display changes
 ---------------
 The Performance Indicator report titles are changed.
  
      "Summary Performance Indicator Report" is replaced by "Summary 
      Verification Timeliness Report".
  
      "Detail Performance Indicator Report" is replaced by "Detail      
      Verification Timeliness Report".  
  
  
 The following spelling and punctuation errors have been corrected for 
 options formerly under the 'Performance Indicator' menu option :
  
      In the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA PERFORMIN RPTS] option, the second
      ":" after the "ending date" has been removed.  For example,
  
           Previous
           --------
           Enter ending date:  :  (1/1/2005 - 4/2/2005):
  
           New
           ---
           Enter ending date:  (1/1/2005 - 2/1/2005):
  
      In the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA PERFORMIN RPTS] option, for a
      Detail report, the "Sort report by"'s "Cateory of Exam" is replaced
      by "Category of Exam".
  
      In the 'Enter/Edit OUTLOOK mail group' [RA PERFORMIN MAIL GROUP
      ENTRY] option, the help text for "Select PERF INDC SMTP E-MAIL
      ADDRESS" has "info on SMTP addrseses". This will be replaced by "info
      on SMTP addresses".
  
 The Detail report under the former 'Performance Indicator' menu's
 'Summary/Detail report' option will allow "^" out of viewing the report 
 on screen.  It will display "Press RETURN to continue or "^" to exit.", 
 instead of just "Press RETURN to continue."
  
 The blank page that used to appear before the former Performance 
 Indicator reports (summary and detail) will be suppressed in the renamed 
 Verification Timeliness reports.  A blank page may or may not print after 
 the renamed Verification Timeliness reports, depending upon the site's 
 device and terminal type setup.  The same blank page suppression is used
 in the Outpatient Procedure Wait Time reports.
  
 --------------
 Remedy tickets
 --------------
 This patch also fixes a bug reported in Remedy Tickets #110069 and
 #116641, where the Performance Indicator Detail Report rounded up the
 decimal hours to the next higher integer.  This patch will truncate the
 decimal from the hours.
  
 The updated manuals described in the next section include corrections to 
 various documentation problems reported in Remedy Ticket #105290.

 rebuild Menu Trees.  All Radiology users should be off the system
 during the installation.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load

      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport

        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
