Description:
============

 This NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) patch is part of the Patient Financial
 Services System (PFSS) project. PFSS patches are being released on various
 schedules. Some patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS
 switch is activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
 implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system. The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The 
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing
 patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Functional Description:
 =======================
 The Charge Description Master (CDM) is an industry standard financial tool
 common to all commercial billing systems and used in virtually every
 private hospital. The CDM is a comprehensive listing of all services
 performed, drugs supplied, or supplies provided in a particular hospital
 along with the value of those services, drugs, items, or charge amounts.
 Each of these entries are represented by a Charge Code, and the Charge
 Code is made up of a Department Code and Service Code. The Charge Code for
 Pharmacy will be the Department Code 160 concatenated with the assigned
 Service Code for the drug. The Department Code 160 will not be stored in
 any files and the Service Code will be established or approved
 by a central CDM Change Control Board (CCB). The implementation of the
 COTS billing system requires the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to link the
 service master Service Code to every Pharmacy prescription fill or refill.
 Pharmacy will create and populate a Service Code (in the 600,001 - 699,999
 range) for each entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68). Initially, the
 Service Code will be populated by this patch and subsequently the CDM CCB
 assigned Service Codes will be distributed as data update patches within
 the NDF releases.
  
  
 Technical Description:
 ======================
 This NDF patch PSN*4*103 provides the following functionality needed to 
 support the PFSS project:
  
 1. A new SERVICE CODE field (#2000) was added to the VA PRODUCT file 
    (#50.68).
 2. A Post-install routine will initially populate the new SERVICE
    CODE field (#2000) for every entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) with
    a six digit number to be within the range 600001-699999. The logic 
    comprises of the Internal Entry Number (IEN) padding it with zeroes as
    needed and adding a "6" on the front to make up a six digit number.
