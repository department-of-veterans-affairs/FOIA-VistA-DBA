  Subject: Fixes to Default list and Order Acknowledgement
  
  Category: - Routine
  
  Description:
  ============
  This patch introduces fixes to the Care Management Application.
   
  DEFAULT LIST
   
  If the default list in CPRS is set to be a combination list, it would 
  not show in Care Management.  This problem has been fixed to now show the
  Combination list as a default list in Care Management.
    
  ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT INQUIRY
   
  Fileman Inquiries into the ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT file (102.4) are
  causing the terminal to appear to hang.  This is because the .01 field of
  file 102.4 points to file 100 which does not have a B cross reference.  
  Thus the Inquiry searches all records in file 100 for a match to the user
  input which takes a very long time in most cases.  In order to provide
  this functionality, utilities have been created to facilitate inquiries
  into file 102.4.  They are created as options under a new "Care
  Management Menu" [ORRC CM MENU].  This menu is located under the "CPRS
  Configuration (Clin Coord)" Menu [OR PARAM COORDINATOR MENU].
  The options are as follows:
   
      OR     ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT INQUIRY BY ORDER
      PR     ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT INQUIRY BY PROVIDER
