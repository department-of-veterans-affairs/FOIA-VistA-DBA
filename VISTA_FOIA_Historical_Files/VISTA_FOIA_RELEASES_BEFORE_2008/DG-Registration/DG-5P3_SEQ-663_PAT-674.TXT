Subject: CHDR SECURITY KEYS

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 I. Overview
  
   This patch contains two new security keys that are released in support
   of the Clinical Data Repository / Health Data Repository (CHDR)
   project.  The security keys provide role-based access to the CHDR web-
   based graphical user interface (GUI).  CHDR uses the Kernel Authentication
   & Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE) logon to pass the security keys from
   the VistA server to the CHDR web-based GUI.
  
   The DG CHDRUSER security key allows a user to modify the Active Dual
   Consumer (ADC) flag on a patient.  The security key should be assigned
   to users that require the ability to set the ADC flag on a patient.
  
   The DG CHDRADMIN security key allows a user to access the Message 
   Audit log view and the Terminology Translation Audit log view.
   The security key should be assigned to users that are responsible
   for reviewing the Audit logs.
