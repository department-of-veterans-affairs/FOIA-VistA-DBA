Description: 
============

 The Hepatitis C Extract project was created to meet Hepatitis C Initiative
 requirements. The House Veterans Affairs Committee requires periodic
 reporting by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) on progress toward
 screening all veterans for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The VHA Headquarters
 Infectious Disease Program Office will provide the periodic reports. These
 reports will be based on HCV information extracted from VHA facilities and
 stored in the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database located at the
 Austin Automation Center (AAC). The HCV information includes Hepatitis C
 risk assessment, laboratory tests, and medications provided to the veteran
 population. Tracking this information will allow the Infectious Disease
 Program Office to respond to Congressional queries about HCV veteran care.
  
 This project consists of four patches that work together to accomplish EPI
 search, extraction, and reporting requirements for Hepatitis A, B, and C: 
  
         PXRM*1.5*1      Hepatitis C Extract
         LR*5.2*260      Hepatitis C Extract
         PSJ*5*48        Hepatitis C Extract
         PSO*7*45        Hepatitis C Extract
  
 These patches are combined into a single build for ease of installation at
 VHA facilities: HEP_C_EXTRACT_1_0.KID

   Patch Description specific to PXRM*1.5*1
   ========================================  
   This patch adds:
     * 2 new reminder definitions to the REMINDER DEFINITION file (811.9)
     * 18 new national terms to the REMINDER TERM file (811.5)
     * 1 new file, REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY (810.3), that temporarily
       stores data extracted from reminder evaluation processing when
       updating the EPI database. This temporary data can be used to
       compare to data in HL7 messages sent to the EPI database, and
       validate that the appropriate data is extracted.
     * 2 new options added to the PXRM REMINDER REPORTS option menu to
       print data from the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3)
     * 2 new sort templates, one to identify terms to distribute and one
       for the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file
     * 3 new print templates, all related to reporting the EPI findings
  
   This patch modifies the:
     * description in the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT reminder definition
     * description for 3 previously distributed Reminder Terms
     * name and description for the Reminder Term PREV POSITIVE TEST FOR
       HEP C, which is renamed PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED HEP C RISK
  
   This patch will work with the LR*5.2*260 patch and two pharmacy
   patches (PSO*7*45 and PSJ*5*48) to extract Hepatitis C risk
   assessment, laboratory and medication data. The extracted data will be
   used to update the EPI database at the AAC.
  
  General Overview:
  =================
   This patch is released in response to Congressional reporting
   requirements and a policy letter distributed by the Under Secretary of
   Health addressing treatment of Hepatitis patients.
  
   The data extracted for Risk Assessment is based on the VA-HEP C RISK
   ASSESSMENT reminder definition.  The data extracted from laboratory is
   based on the VA-NATIONAL EPI LAB EXTRACT reminder, previously
   distributed as VA-NATIONAL EPI DB UPDATE.  Both of these reminders were
   first released in the Clinical Reminders V.1.5 package. A new reminder
   definition, VA-NATIONAL EPI RX EXTRACT, is distributed in this patch for
   extracting medications. These three reminder definitions provide the
   criteria for extracting the risk assessment, lab, and medication data.
  
   The reminder evaluation and update to the EPI database occurs on the
   15th of the month following the reporting month. The option that manages
   this update is the LREPI NIGHTLY TASK.  This task currently runs nightly
   at each site. Note: The monthly task on the 15th occurs because the LAG
   DAYS field in the LAB SEARCH/EXTRACT file (69.5) is set to "15" for each
   pathogen. The LR*5.2*260 patch contains new processing logic that sends
   data extracted from reminder extract results to the EPI database.
  
   This patch also fixes a problem where CUSTOMIZED PATIENT COHORT LOGIC was 
   not being used in the reminder evaluation. (NOIS SLC-0600-52703).

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   
  The instructions for installation and implementation of the
  HEP_C_EXTRACT_1_0.KID build are included in the PXRMP1.PDF file.
  
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
  to users.  Installation will take less than 15 minutes.
   
                            **Warning** 
  When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
  is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question.  If you choose to have KIDs rebuild
  the menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may
  take several hours.
   
  POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  ============================== 
  The details of the setup to be completed is available in the
  documentation. Generally, these steps need to be done by the REMINDERS
  MANAGER or the CLINICAL REMINDERS APPLICATION COORDINATOR. The success of
  the Hepatitis C updates to the EPI database will depend on a Hepatitis
  Team at your site addressing all of the issues in the documentation.
  
 DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
 =====================
 Data Dictionary:
  
   1. REMINDER DEFINITION file (811.9)
      The reminder for VA-NATIONAL EPI DB UPDATE may be used at sites to
      determine whether a patient has data that is sent to the Austin
      Automation Center to update the national EPI database.
  
   2. REMINDER TERM file (811.5)
      There are twenty reminder terms used by the lab and pharmacy extract
      reminders. Eighteen of these terms are newly distributed in this
      file. These new terms represent Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and
      Hepatitis C lab and medication information. The reminder terms may be
      used at sites in locally defined reminders for clinicians providing
      clinical care for Hepatitis patients.
  
      Hepatitis A laboratory reminder terms:
          HAV Ab positive         Hepatitis A virus antibody total positive
          HAV IgM Ab positive     Hepatitis A virus antibody immunoglobulin
                                          M positive 
          HAV IgG positive        Hepatitis A virus antibody immunoglobulin
                                          G positive
          Bilirubin
  
      Hepatitis B laboratory reminder terms:
          HBs Ag positive         Hepatitis B surface antigen positive 
          HBc Ab IgM positive     Hepatitis B core antibody immunoglobulin
                                          M positive 
          HBs Ab positive         Hepatitis B surface antibody positive
          HBe Ag positive         Hepatitis B e antigen positive 
  
      Hepatitis C laboratory reminder terms: 
          HEP C VIRUS ANTIBODY NEGATIVE    
          HEP C VIRUS ANTIBODY POSITIVE    
          TRANSFERASE (AST) (SGOT)
          ALANINE AMINO (ALT) (SGPT)
  
      Hepatitis Medications (based on VA GENERIC file): 
          INTERFERON ALFA-2A 
          INTERFERON ALFA-2B     
          INTERFERON ALFA-2B/RIBAVIRIN 
          INTERFERON ALFA-3N     
          INTERFERON ALFACON-1 
          INTERFERON BETA-1A 
          INTERFERON BETA-1B 
          RIBAVIRIN           
  
 Sort Template:
  
    PXRM EPI LAB AND MED TERMS contains reminder term entries defined above
    to distribute with the REMINDER TERM (811.5) data dictionary.
  
    PXRM EXTRACT EPI BY FIND_PT sorts an extract by Finding Item and SSN.
    This sort template may be useful when looking up an SSN to compare
    findings to an error message returned to the site from the AAC.  When
    the AAC has problems processing a sites extracted data, the original
    extract message and SSN are returned to the site in an error message
    for review and correction.
