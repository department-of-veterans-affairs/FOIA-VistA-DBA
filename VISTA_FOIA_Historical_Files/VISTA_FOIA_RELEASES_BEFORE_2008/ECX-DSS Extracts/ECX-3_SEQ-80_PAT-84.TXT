 PHARMACY ENCAPSULATION INTEGRATION AGREEMENT 4551 AND 4483

 In preparation for the re-hosting of VistA Pharmacy applications
 modifications were  made to implement the new Pharmacy APIs. All existing
 references (direct global reads/writes, VA FileMan reads/writes) to 
 Pharmacy Data Management and National Drug File were replaced with the 
 released Pharmacy APIs.

 (#55.01), IV Room field (#.22) and DATE VERIFIED BY NURSE field

 DSS PERSON CLASS API
 ====================
 DSS uses Kernel's supported Person Class to retrieve the Person Class for
 the provider associated with patient care encounter and it uses the date
 of the encounter as one of the parameters required by the API. There are 
 instances where a provider might place an order 6 months in advance and 
 the current API does not return person class values when the provider has
 been separated because their person class entry gets deactivated. The DSS
 PRVCLASS^ECXUTL API was modified to use order date as an alternate date
 for LAB, LAR, PRE, and RAD.
   
  
 NEW ORDERING STOP CODE FIELD FOR IVP AND UDP
 ============================================
 ORDERING STOP CODE field is now populated in the Pharmacy IV Detail (IVP)
 Extract file (#727.819) to track Outpatient IVP orders. The value for the
 field is obtained by locating the CLINIC field (#136) on the Pharmacy
 Patient file (#55) IV multiple (#55.01), which points to the Hospital
 Location file (#44) field (#8) STOP CODE NUMBER. If the Treating Specialty
 field is 18, 23, 24, 36, 41, 65 or 94 then the ORDERING STOP CODE field is
 populated with the corresponding Observation Stop Code using the following
 table.
  
 Treating Specialty      Observation Stop Code
       18                       293

 ORDERING STOP CODE field (#58) is now populated in the Unit Dose
 Prescription (UDP) Extract file (#727.809) to track Outpatient UDP orders.

 the Pharmacy Patient file (#55), UNIT DOSE multiple (#55.06), which points
 to the Hospital Location file (#44) field (#8) STOP CODE NUMBER. If the
 Treating Specialty field is 18, 23, 24, 36, 41, 65 or 94 then the ORDERING
 STOP CODE field is populated with the corresponding Observation Stop Code
 using the following table.

       36                       294
       41                       296
       65                       291
       94                       292
  
   
 RAD Stop Code 
 =============
 The Radiology (RAD) Extract file (#727.814) was modified to rename field
 (#34) ORDERING STOP CODE to RAD STOP CODE.
  
 The current logic for populating ORDERING STOP CODE/RAD STOP CODE field
 (#34) was modified so that it populates the stop code based on the
 IMAGING LOCATION field (#4) from RAD/NUC MED PATIENT file (#70) REGISTERED
 EXAMS sub-file (#70.02).
