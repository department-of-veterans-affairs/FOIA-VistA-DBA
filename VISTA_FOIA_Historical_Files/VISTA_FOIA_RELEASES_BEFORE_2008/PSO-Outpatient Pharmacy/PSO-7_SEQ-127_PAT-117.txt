Subject: OTHER LANGUAGE MODULE PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 1. This patch provides new functionality that allows the Veteran Affairs
 Medical Centers to print a patient's prescription bottle label in another
 language.  This functionality is accomplished by identifying which
 patients have another language preference. To identify patients 
 as having another language preference use the Update
 Patient Record [PSO PAT] option and the Patient Record Update [PSO PATIENT
 RECORD UPDATE] protocol action and enter Yes in the new field
 OTHER LANGUAGE PREFERENCE field (#106) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
  
 2. This patch also addresses the following NOIS issues: 
  
 a) ISB-0702-32646 
  
 For drugs that have possible dosages, if the dosage is edited using 
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, the 
 software calculates the new DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE field (#1) of the 
 MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS sub-file (#113) of the PRESCRIPTION file 
 (#52), accordingly. At the confirmation prompt that follows 
 immediately if you respond "NO", meaning not to accept the new value, 
 the software does not revert the DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE field (#1) back to
 it's original value. This patch fixes this issue.  
  
 b) CAH-0402-31866
  
 When entering a new prescription using the Patient Prescription
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if that prescription is
 discontinued before it goes to the label queue prompt, currently,
 the label "LABEL QUEUE/CHANGE PRINTER/SUSPEND or '^' to bypass Q//" is
 prompted. If this is the only order in that session then there is no
 label to print and therefore the label queue prompt should not be
 displayed. This patch fixes this problem.
  
 c) ISH-0902-40182
  
 Between the time an order was placed in Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) V. 1.0 and the time the order is processed in the backdoor
 pharmacy, if the dispense drug is made inactive, then there is a
 possibility of getting an undefined error if a "?" is entered when editing
 the dosage prompt. Since the drug is inactive the software does not gather
 the available dosages and as a result the undefined error. In order
 to process such an order (avoiding the undefined error), this patch
 will provide the user the option of making a free text dosage entry.
  
 d) LIT-1102-71356
  
 When a site merges two patients together, the PHARMACY PATIENT file
 (#55) contains all of the prescriptions from the "merged from" 
 patient and the "merged to" patient under the internal entry number
 of the "merged to" patient. The old patient's internal entry number
 is kept in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for any prescriptions that 
 were originally filed with that number. If a new prescription is
 ordered for a drug that is already in the prescription profile, the
 order entry process will discontinue the old prescription correctly.
 The problem is that if the discontinued order belongs to the old
 patient internal entry number, the new prescription order is filed
 with the old patient's internal entry number in the PHARMACY PATIENT
 file (#55) and the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and doesn't appear on the
 prescription profile. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 3. A more descriptive message will now be given to the user when an order 
 is accessed, and that order is locked by another user, when copying a 
 prescription, selecting a pending order, discontinuing a prescription,
 and processing a non-verified prescription.
  
 4. If pre-POE prescriptions are renewed or edited to create a new
 prescription, the resulting prescription may have a missing SIG. This patch
 corrects the problem.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
 install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 users are on the system
 or when Outpatient orders are being entered and signed through Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0.  Installation will take no longer than 5
 minutes.  Suggested time to install: During non-peak requirement hours for
 CPRS V. 1.0 and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 users.  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*117) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*117.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  
  The revised User and Technical Manuals are available on the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of Information
  (OI) Field Offices.
  
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from

  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
       Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
