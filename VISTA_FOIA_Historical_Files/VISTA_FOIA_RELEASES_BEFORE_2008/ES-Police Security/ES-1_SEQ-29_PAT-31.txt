Subject: POLICE OFFICER ADD/EDIT

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses a problem with the option Police Officer Add/Edit
 [ESP POLICE OFFICER EDIT].  The option prompts the user for a NEW PERSON
 NAME.  When the user enters a name the name is echoed back on the screen
 the user can edit that name.  After that point, the screen will display a
 message if the name selected does not hold the Police Security key saying
 that person cannot be edited.  Any changes that were made to the actual
 name remain.  Changes in the software include screening names from the NEW
 PERSON file (#200) so that only persons with the Police Security key are
 selectable, and no editing of the names themselves is permitted.
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VistA users will not be affected.
