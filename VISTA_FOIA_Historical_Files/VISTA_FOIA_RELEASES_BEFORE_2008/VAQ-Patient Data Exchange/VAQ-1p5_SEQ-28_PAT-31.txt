Description: 
============

  Patch VAQ*1.5*31
   
  NOIS ISL-1198-52170
  Test Site: Oklahoma City
  
  This patch enables PDX to recognize and report on NKA (No Known Allergy)
  when using the API EN1^GMRADPT, provided by the Adverse Reaction Tracking
  package.
  
  Adverse Reaction Tracking released a patch, GMRA*4*10, which changed the
  data returned by EN1^GMRADPT if the patient has NKA.
  
  Before the patch, the API returned:
  GMRAL=0
  GMRAL(<ptr to file 120.8>)=DFN_"^NKA^0^1"
  
  After the patch, the API returned:
  GMRAL=0
  
  PDX used to grab "NKA" from the GMRAL array.  After GMRA*4*10, there was
  nothing to grab.  This patch, VAQ*1.5*31, ensures that PDX recognizes that
  GMRAL=0 means "NKA".
   
  NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
  is at a minimum.  It has no patch pre-requisite requirement.
