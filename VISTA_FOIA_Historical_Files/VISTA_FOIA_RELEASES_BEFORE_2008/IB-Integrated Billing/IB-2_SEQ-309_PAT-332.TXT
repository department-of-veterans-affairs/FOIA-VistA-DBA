 -------------------------------------------
 The new Treating Specialties are all identified as Long Term Care Treating

 Updated Treating Specialties
 ----------------------------
 Two previously existing Treating Specialties are being updated.
                                           
         Treating  Specialty           Service  Bedsection  Long Term Care
 Old: 83 RESPITE CARE                  RESPITE              LTC INPT RESPITE
 New: 83 RESPITE CARE (MEDICINE)       RESPITE              LTC INPT RESPITE
                                           
 The name of Treating Specialty 83 will be changed from 'Respite Care' to 
 'Respite Care (Medicine)'.  This has no impact on billing and therefore 
 results in no change to IB.
                                           
         Treating Specialty             Service  Bedsection    Long Term Care
 Old: 95 INTERMEDIATE MEDICINE - LTC    INTERM   INTERMEDIATE   
 New: 95 NH SHORT STAY SKILLED NURSING  NHCU     NURSING HOME  LTC INPT NHCU
                                           
 Treating Specialty 95 is being changed from a Treating Specialty for 
 Intermediate Care to NHCU care.  Since the definition of the type of care 
 provided in this Treating Specialty is being changed, the billing of this 
 Treating Specialty must be changed to correspond.
 -  The Billable Bedsection for Treating Specialty 95 will change from 
    Intermediate Care to Nursing Home Care.
 -  Treating Specialty 95 will be added to the list of Long Term Care 
    Treating Specialties with the LTC INPT NHCU rate.
 The result is that for care in Treating Specialty 95, Third Party billing 
 will be changed from Cost Based Intermediate Care charges to Nursing Home 
 Care charges and First Party Charges will be changed from Means Test 
 Copay/PerDiem to the Long Term Care Copay.
                                           
                                           
 New/Updated Treating Specialties and Reasonable Charges
 -------------------------------------------------------
 The Reasonable Charges Facility charge for most Inpatient care is based on 
 a DRG per diem, except Skilled Nursing which is based on a daily per diem. 
 The Treating Specialties associated with Nursing Home Care are currently 
 exempt from the automatic calculation of the DRG charges, since they 
 usually should be billed the Skilled Nursing Per Diem.  
                                           
 The following new and updated Treating Specialties will be added to the 
 list of the Treating Specialties exempt from the automatic DRG charge 
 calculation to reduce the possibility that they will be incorrectly billed 
 the DRG per diem.
