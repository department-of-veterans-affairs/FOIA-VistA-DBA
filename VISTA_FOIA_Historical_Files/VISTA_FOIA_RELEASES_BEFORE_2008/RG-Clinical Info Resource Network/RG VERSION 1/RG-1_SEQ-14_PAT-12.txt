Subject: CIRN EXCEPTION HANDLING ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  DG*5.3*333, RG*1.0*3, RG*1.0*6 and RG*1.0*10 are required builds for
  patch RG*1*12.
   
  For Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and
  Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0 sites, Clinical Information
  Resource Network (CIRN) patch RG*1.0*12 should be installed immediately
  after DG*5.3*333.
   
  1.  This patch includes enhancements to the CIRN Exception Handling
  [RG CIRN EXCEPTION HANDLING] option.  These changes were requested
  by CIRN PD/MPI contacts participating in a September 12 - 14, 2000
  meeting in Augusta, GA.
   a.) The following actions on the CIRN EXCEPTION HANDLING List Manager
  screen have been changed.
  Before:                     After:
  SP  Sort by Patient         SN Sort by Patient Name
  INQ Patient Inquiry         PI Patient Inquiry
  EXC Select Exception        SE Select Exception
   b.) "Date" was changed to "Dt Rec'd" in the heading.
   c.) A new action, "TF  Treating Facility Inquiry," has been added
  to the CIRN EXCEPTION HANDLING ACTIONS List Manager screen.  When selected,
  this action displays the CIRN Master of Record (CMOR), treating facility
  list, subscriber list, etc.  This information comes from the VAFCPDAT
  utility routine.
   
  2.  In RGEVPRG, code was added to purge entries from exception
  handling that are merging or have been merged (when patient name
  contains "MERGING").
   
  3.  Code was modified to remove the CMOR exception "CANNOT MERGE your
  site is not the CMOR site for this patient."  Sites will now be able
  to perform a duplicate record merge if they are not the CMOR for that
  patient.  The CMOR that will be retained is the one that belongs to
  the record for which the ICN is being kept.
   
  4.  In RG*1.0*7, we removed the Edit Merge Parameter [RG MERGE EDIT 
  PARAMETER] option from the Patient Merge Utilities [RG MERGE PATIENT]
  menu.  That left only one option on that menu.  Therefore, in this
  patch, we are eliminating the Patient Merge Utilities [RG MERGE PATIENT]
  option and bringing the Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER]
  option up one level in the menu structure.  The Patient Data Review
  [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER] option is now an item on the CIRN Patient
  Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].  This resolves NOIS
  issue CLA-1000-20897.
   
  5.  The following menu items were inadvertently left off of the
  CMOR User Menu [RGCIRN CMOR USER MENU] with the distribution of
  CIRN PD/MPI v. 1.0 and are being attached with this patch.  These
  options have always been available on the CIRN Pre-Implementation
  Menu [RGPR PRE-IMP MENU].
      CMOR Score Calculation Status [RGCIRN CMOR STATUS]
      Duplicate Record by CMOR Score [RGCIRN CMOR DUP SCORES]
      Duplicate Record Statistics [RGCIRN CMOR DUP STATS]
   
  New Option:
  ===========
  The Treating Facility Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option displays
  CIRN PD/MPI information for a selected patient.  This new option is
  placed on the Message Exception Menu [RG EXCEPTION MENU].
   
  New Protocol:
  =============
  A new protocol, RG EXCPT TF INQUIRY, is included to support CIRN
  Exception Handling.  This protocol displays CIRN PD/MPI information
  for the selected patient.
   
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  Revised information about Exception Handling is available at the
  following website address.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 1 minute.
   
  1.  For existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites, patch RG*1.0*12 should be
      installed immediately after DG*5.3*333.  If you have not done
      so previously for the installation of DG*5.3*333, you should 
      do the following.
      Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM 
      SCHEDULE], unschedule the following option:
        VAFC BATCH UPDATE          UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3
   
  2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  3.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*12).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*12.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
      Install? YES//', respond YES, as this build deletes and adds menu
      options.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites should respond YES.
      Place the CIRN Exception Handling [RG CIRN EXCEPTION HANDLING] option
      out of order.
   
  10. Using the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE],
      schedule the option VAFC BATCH UPDATE [UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3]
      to run every 10 minutes.
   
  11. If you are installing patches DG*5.3*333 and RG*1.0*12 sequentially
      as advised, remember to complete Step 13 of the installation
      instructions for DG*5.3*333 to restart the incoming filers.
