 Though this patch adds no new entries to the disability condition file, 
 one of the test sites noted the existence of duplicate disability 
 conditions.  Further investigation has shown that though several sites 
 have duplicates, there is no evidence that they were introduced by a 
 patch, rather they appear to have been locally created.  Discussions are 
 underway on a possible response to that issue.  There are no known 
 complications from the presence of these duplicates.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 1 minute.
  
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
       be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVB*4.0*50)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVB*4.0*50.
  
    6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//" respond NO.
  
    7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
    8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
  
  
 NOTE:  During the installation, If any codes already exist in the 
 DISABLITY CONDITION FILE (#31), a message will display on the screen 
 reflecting that the names and/or descriptions have been changed from
 the old values to the new values. If any of these codes do not exist, a
 message will display reflecting the addition of the new codes.
