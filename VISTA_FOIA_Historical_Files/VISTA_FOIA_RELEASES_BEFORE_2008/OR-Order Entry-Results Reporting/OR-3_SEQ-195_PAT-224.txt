 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES RESOLVED IN THIS PATCH:
 ============================================
  
 PSI-04-031 - CCOW - Patient Name Not Updating, 07/02/04
  
 Safeguards have been added to this version to ensure CPRS behaves 
 correctly in the case of a communications error with the CCOW vault.  In 
 this version, such an error will disable CCOW synchronization for the 
 remainder of the session, and will also ensure the integrity and 
 correctness of the data being displayed by refreshing the data for the 
 patient who was previously selected before the error occurred.  These 
 steps should resolve patient safety issue PSI-04-031.
  
 The KIDS portion of the installation will simply update the version number
 of the OR CPRS GUI CHART option to be 1.0.24.27. The .ZIP file contains an
 updated CPRS executable.  
  
 CLA-0604-21036 - We recently installed HealtheVet on our thin client work 
 stations along With the Vergence software. This morning users were
 experiencing the wrong patient on their CPRS display.
  
 With this fix They should no longer get the Contextor error, and should
 see the new friendlier message instead.  After that, synchronization
 should be disabled, the current patient refreshed, and no further attempts
 at reaching the vault should occur.  It won't prevent vault communications
 errors, but should behave safely and correctly if they occur.
