 1)  Refer NOIS CMO-1298-41450, and CMO-0299-42378.
     The current Vital/Measurement Data Entry [GMRV V/M ENTRY MENU]
     menu options listed accepts 0 as a user data entry:
     1.    TPR Pain [GMRV TPR ROUTINE]
     2.    TPR B/P Pain [GMRV TPR B/P ROUTINE]
     3.    TPR B/P Ht. Wt. and Pain [GMRV ADMISSION V/M]
     4.    TPR B/P Wt. and Pain [GMRV TPRBW]
     5.    Temp, Detailed PR and B/P [GMRV TPR EXT B/P]
     6.    Detailed B/P and Associated Pulse [GMRV EXT B/P]
     7.    Pulse [GMRV PULSE]
     8.    User Configurable Combination [GMRV VMCONFIG]
     
     This will allow the user to enter a 0 or 1 as the pulse entry to represent
     absent/present of Pedal pulse (DORSALIS PEDIS). The package
     does store the qualifiers entered for either entry but it does not
     print/display the qualifiers for a 0 DORSALIS PEDIS entry.  This patch
     will allow all qualifiers stored for any 0 value entry to be 
     printed/displayed to the user.  The DORSALIS PEDIS would be displayed as
     0* or 1 where '*' represents an (abnormal) value. The DORSALIS PEDIS
     WILL ONLY be displayed on the following reports:
      
         1. The table portion of the Vital Signs Record under V/M Graphic
            Reports [GMRV SF511]
       
         2. Cumulative Vitals Report [GMRV CUMULATIVE V/M]
  
         3. Print Vitals Entered in Error for a Patient [GMRV ERROR REPORT]
  
     Routine(s) changed: GMRVDS0, GMRVDS2, GMRVED1, GMRVED4, GMVEE0
                         GMRVER1, GMRVSC0, GMRVSC2, GMRVSR0, and GMRVVS1.
                               
 2)  This patch will make the following modifications in the V/M Graphic
     Reports [GMRV SF511] option:
  
     1. Vital Signs Record.
        Pulse Graph: Limit plotted values to radial, brachial, or apical pulses.
        Pulse Table: All pulses are displayed.
     
     2. B/P Plotting Chart.
        Pulse table: Limit the displayed values to radial, brachial, or
        apical pulses.  It also displays the reason for omission.
  
     3. Pulse Oximetry/Respiratory Graph.
        Pulse table: Limit the displayed values to radial, brachial, or
        apical pulses.  It also displays the reason for omission.
  
     On both the Latest Vitals Display for a Patient [GMRV DISPLAY V/M]
     and Latest Vitals by Location [GMRV V/M BY LOCATION] options, the
     pulse display will be limited to the latest radial, brachial, or
     apical pulses.
  
     Routine(s) changed: GMRVBP0, GMRVDS0, GMRVDS2, GMRVEE2, GMRVGR0,
                         GMRVGR1, GMRVHG0, GMRVHG4, GMRVHPO0, GMRVKPO0,
                         GMRVLPO0, GMRVLPO2, and GMRVVS4.
  
  3) Refer E3R 11395
     This patch will allow the users to enter just the systolic value of
     Blood Pressure for doppler and palpated methods. The data in the
     RATE INPUT TRANSFORM field (#4) in the GMRV VITAL TYPE (#120.51) file
     for the 'BLOOD PRESSURE' entry has been modified. This change affects
     all the B/P data entries under the Vital/Measurement Data Entry
     [GMRV V/M ENTRY MENU] menu listed in the following:
  
     1.    TPR B/P Pain [GMRV TPR B/P ROUTINE]
     2.    TPR B/P Ht. Wt. and Pain [GMRV ADMISSION V/M]
     3.    TPR B/P Wt. and Pain [GMRV TPRBW]
     4.    Temp, Detailed PR and B/P [GMRV TPR EXT B/P]
     5.    Detailed B/P and Associated Pulse [GMRV EXT B/P]
     6.    User Configurable Combination [GMRV VMCONFIG]
    
     The user can enter just the systolic value such as 120/,
     or 120/D (Doppler method).  The default will be Palpated method if
     no method is specified.
                                                                              
     Routine(s) changed: GMRVED3, GMRVHPO3, GMRVQUAL, GMRVSAS0, GMRVUT1,
                         GMRVUT3, and GMRVVS1.
    
  4) Refer NOIS WBP-0599-21953
     When there is supplemental oxygen for a Pulse Oximetry entry and
     the user does not enter a flow rate but a oxygen concentration %
     in the Pulse Oximetry [GMRV O2SATURATION] or the Pulse Oximetry
     selection of User Configurable Combination [GMRV VMCONFIG] option,
     the oxygen concentration percentage is displayed with the flow
     rate attached to it (such as e.g. 30%L/Min).  The L/min
     should not be there.
      
     The oxygen concentration percentage is also found to be printed before
     the flow rate (such as 30% 15L/min) when the data is entered
     with the flow rate after the oxygen concentration percentage
     (such as oxygen concentration,flow rate).  A post-init routine GMRVPS11,
     will correct the SUPPLEMENTAL O2 Field #1.4 in the GMRV VITAL
     MEASUREMENT File # 120.5 when the data is stored as #% # l/min rather
     than # l/min #%.
     
     The following options will be fixed to print the supplemental
     oxygen as #L/min #%:
     
     1.  Latest Vitals Display for a Patient [GMRV DISPLAY V/M]
     2.  Latest Vitals by Location [GMRV V/M BY LOCATION]  
     3.  Cumulative Vitals Report [GMRV CUMULATIVE V/M]
     4.  Print Vitals Entered in Error for a Patient [GMRV ERROR REPORT]
     
     Routine(s) changed: GMRVDS0, GMRVDS2, GMRVED1, GMRVED4, GMVEE0
                         GMRVER1, GMRVSC0, GMRVSC2, GMRVSR0, and GMRVVS1.
    
  5) If the user enters a 0 (Apical, Brachial, or Radial) for pulse,
     the 0 shows up as .1 and the qualifier(s) are not listed in the table
     portion of the Pulse Oximetry/Respiratory Graph.  Routine GMRVKPO1
     was modified to fix this problem.
     
     Routine changed: GMRVKPO1

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  This patch should be installed during none production hours.
  Installation of this patch may take 5 minutes to 1 hour.  This all depends
  on the number of records that the post-init routine have to go through to
  fix the SUPPLEMENTAL O2 field in the GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT file #120.5.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
      load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
      the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
      select the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
      options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRV*4.0*11):
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       b.  Print Transport Global
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
       d.  Backup a Transport Global
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      GMRV*4.0*11.
  
  6.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
      Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO"
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
      should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
      has run to completion.
    
  8.  Delete the post init routine GMRVPS11 after the installation has
      run to completion.
