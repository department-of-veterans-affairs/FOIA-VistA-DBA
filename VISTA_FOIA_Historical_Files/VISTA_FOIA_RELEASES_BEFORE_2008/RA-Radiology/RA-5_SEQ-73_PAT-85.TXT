 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1
 ------- 
 When registering exams in Register Patient for Exams [RA REG] menu option,
 the user can input any past date.
                
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 When entering a date of more than one year in the past, modifications have 
 been made to notify the user and ask if they are sure they want to
 continue.
         
 Problem #2
 -------
 The system currently allows cancelling of a standalone case with images 
 if the images are attached to a stub report.
      
 Resolution #2
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to routines RAEDCN and RASTREQ1 to 
 only allow cancelling of exams with images if the exam is part of 
 a printset.
      
 Problem #3
 -------
 When using Print Rad/Nuc Med Requests by Date [RA ORDERPRINTS] menu option
 or Print Selected Requests by Patient [RA ORDERPRINTPAT] option, if the
 site is utilizing bar codes and the new Reason for Study field is longer
 than 30 characters, it will print in the bar code on some but not all
 printers.
      
 Resolution #3
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RAORD6 to print a line feed 
 before printing the Reason for Study field.
