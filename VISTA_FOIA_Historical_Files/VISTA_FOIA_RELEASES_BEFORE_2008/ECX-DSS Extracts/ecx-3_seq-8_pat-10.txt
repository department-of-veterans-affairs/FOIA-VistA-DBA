Subject: USE API FOR PHARMACY FEEDER KEYS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   
   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines).  
     
   ****************************************************************
    
   The derivation of DSS Feeder Keys for pharmacy products will change due
   to the implementation of the National Drug File Redesign initiative.
   
   The routines contained in this patch have been revised to use the new
   API developed expressly for this purpose and distributed with NATIONAL
   DRUG FILE v4.0.  Please note that it is not necessary to have installed
   NATIONAL DRUG FILE v4.0 before installing this patch.
   
   The following DSS Extracts options are affected:
   
   Feeder Keys Print        [ECXFEKEY]
   IV Extract               [ECXIV]
   Pharmacy NDC Lookup      [ECXNDC]
   Prescription Extract     [ECXPSO]
   Unit Dose Extract        [ECXUD]
   
   Routines ECXFEKEY, ECXOPRX, ECXPIVD, ECXPIVDN, and ECXUD will call
   DSS^PSNAPIS, if it exists on the system.  Otherwise, the Feeder Key
   will be derived as before.  The revision in routine ECXNDC is simply
   a documentation change.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*10):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*10.
    
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       ECXFEKEY     Feeder Keys Print        
       ECXIV        IV Extract               
       ECXNDC       Pharmacy NDC Lookup      
       ECXPSO       Prescription Extract     
       ECXUD        Unit Dose Extract        
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
