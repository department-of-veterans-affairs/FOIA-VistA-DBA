Subject: CANCELLED APPT DISPLAYING AS # SIGN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve two issues.  First, it will fix the problem 
 with overbook appointments made outside a clinic's normal hours.  These 
 appointments currently display the incorrect symbol on the Display Clinic 
 Availability Report grid.  Secondly, when making an appointment, a user is
 allowed to make an appointment for a past date that is prior to the 
 clinic's availability date or the patient's birth date.  This will
 also be corrected.  Past appointments dates will still be allowed, as long
 as they are not prior to the clinic's availability date or the patient's
 birth date, whichever is applicable.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD100623 - Cancelled appt displaying as # sign
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If an appointment is made outside a clinic's normal hours (at the end
     of the day) and the appointment variable length is invoked, the
     Display Clinic Availability Report grid does not display properly.  It
     displays the correct symbol, an asterisk (*), for an overbook, but the
     spacing is wrong with the appointment variable length invoked.  For
     example, if the normal appointment length is 30 minutes and the
     appointment is made for 60 minutes, the grid should display:
  
     |1      |2      |3      |4      |5
     |       |       |       |       |
                              *   *
  
     However, instead it is displaying as follows:
  
     |1      |2      |3      |4      |5
     |       |       |       |       |
                              * *
  
     Furthermore, if this appointment is then cancelled, the grid should
     display a blank for these time slots.  Instead, it displays as:
  
     |1      |2      |3      |4      |5
     |       |       |       |       |
                                * #
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The make an appointment logic in routine SDM1 will be modified so
     that these type overbook appointments will display the overbook
     symbol with the correct spacing.  This will also fix the incorrect
     display when such an appointment has been cancelled.
  
 2)  HD63126  - Set Up a Clinic Option
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a clinic is set up, an Availability Date is entered and a
     pattern is established.  When running [Display Clinic Availability
     Report] option, the grid displays available time slots starting with
     the Availability Date and going forward.  However, Appointment
     Management will allow a user to make an appointment prior to the
     established Availability Date, as long as it meets all other criteria
     for the clinic (i.e., matches established pattern and time slots).  
     Now, if you run the [Display Clinic Availability Report] option, the
     grid will include the past date for the appointment that was made.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDM1 will be modified so that when an appointment is being
     made the user will not be allowed to enter a date prior to the
     clinic's established Availability Date.  Past dates for appointments
     will still be allowed, as long as they are not prior to the clinic's
     Availability Date.
  
 3)  HD150393 - Old dates, for example Aug 08, 1800@1400 filed as appt date
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, entering past dates for an appointment is an allowable
     function within Appointment Management.  However, users are allowed
     to enter any past date, no matter how old it is.  For example, the
     system will allow them to enter a date as old as Aug 08, 1800.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDM1 will be modified to not only check for the clinic's
     availability date but also to check to insure the selected appointment
     date is not prior to the patient's birth date.  Additionally, routine
     SDCLAV1 will be modified so that the Clinic Availability Report will
     no longer display available dates that are prior to the clinic's
     original start date.  Routine SDCLAV0 will be modified so that the
     display no longer includes appointments that were made for dates
     prior to the clinic's start date.  These are invalid appointments.
