Subject: VISTALINK VMS COM file change

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  This patch contains information to aid IRM site staff in making necessary
  modifications to the VMS Command (COM) file that is used to start the
  VistALink Listener as a TCP/IP service. This patch pertains to the
  Cache/VMS operating system only.
  
  It has been discovered that the command 'ccontrol session' within 
  the COM file starts Cache as a sub-process.  This uses up extra process 
  slots and can cause errors if the system reaches its max process limit.
  
  Replacing 'ccontrol session' with 'csession' in the COM file will 
  correct this issue.
  
  The VLINK.COM file on the OIFO FTP download sites has been updated. A
  copy of this file can be downloaded and edited to fit your site, or
  edit the current COM file already in place and replace every occurrence
  of 'ccontrol session' with 'csession'.
  (A list of OIFO FTP download sites is available below)
  
  The edits can be made with VistALink enabled and users online. If edits
  are made with users online, the existing connections will still retain
  the extra process slots but any new connections will be correct.
  
  Example of the COM file before editing:
  =======================================
  
  $! for Cache
  $! assign  'f$trnlnm("SYS$NET")' SYS$NET
  $! ccontrol session <configname> "-U" "<namespace>" "CACHEVMS^XOBVTCP"
  $! or if your configname is the same as your node name
  $! ccontrol session "''node'" "-U" "<namespace>" "CACHEVMS^XOBVTCP"
  
  Example of the COM file after editing:
  ====================================== 
  
  $! for Cache
  $! assign  'f$trnlnm("SYS$NET")' SYS$NET
  $! csession <configname> "-U" "<namespace>" "CACHEVMS^XOBVTCP"
  $! or if your configname is the same as your node name
  $! csession "''node'" "-U" "<namespace>" "CACHEVMS^XOBVTCP"
  
  Note:  All the lines in the examples above are comment lines (indicated 
         by the '!'). The '!' needs to be removed from any command lines
         that are to be executed in the COM file.
  
  If you are not familiar with editing a VMS COM file, please contact your
  VistA Systems Manager or call the National Help Desk and log a 
  Remedy ticket for the VistALink package.
  
  The VistALink TCP/IP service cookbook, VISTALINK_TCPIP_COOKBOOK.DOC, has 
  been updated as well and can also be downloaded from the OIFO FTP 
  download sites.
