Subject: HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*148
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*276
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*90
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*48
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (AR) V. 4.5                      PRCA*4.5*230
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
    
 This patch modifies the CMOP application to submit electronic claims for 
 prescriptions that are transmitted to CMOP centers to be filled and dispensed 
 remotely. All the electronically billable prescriptions ready to be included
 on the batch to be transmitted to CMOP are first transmitted to the third 
 party insurance. Once
  this step is completed, the system waits 60 seconds,
 plus an additional 15 seconds for each prescription that was transmitted to
 the third party payer, with a maximum wait of 2 hours. This process will
 affect the existing CMOP functionality in two ways: 
    
  1) If a response from the third party payer is not received within the 
     timeout time described above, the prescription is skipped and remains in
     the queue for the next CMOP transmission. A MailMan message containing
     all the prescriptions in this category is generated at the end of the
     process and it is transmitted to all the holders of the PSXMAIL security
     key. If no users on the system have this key, the MailMan message is
     sent to all the users holding the PSXCMOPMGR security key.
  
  2) If the third party payer rejects the claim due to a DUR (Drug Utilization
     Review) or a 'REFILL TOO SOON' reject, the prescription is not sent to
     CMOP and remains in the queue to be transmitted in the next CMOP 
     transmission. The prescription will not be transmitted to CMOP until the
     reject is resolved by the user through the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 
     application. No message is generated for prescriptions in this category,
     however these prescriptions will be listed on the Third Party Payer
     Reject Worklist.
