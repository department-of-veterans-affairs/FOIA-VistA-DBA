Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  
 Issues and Problems:
 ====================
  
 1. [MAR-1201-21879, MIA-0900-30866, HVH-0202-12038] Fixes a problem where
 Admission, Discharge and Death notifications/alerts were not sent in some
 cases.
  
 2. [MAC-0102-62706, PUG-0302-50159] Changed the screen on the Flagged 
 Orderable Item - Results notifications so all types of imaging
 orderable items can be flagged.
  
 3. [DUB-0202-30018, WPB-0202-31950] Changes the method for determining
 which recipients of a previous "one instance" alert are added as potential
 recipients of a new instance of the alert.  "One instance" alerts are
 those that an alert recipient can only have one instance of that alert per
 patient at any one time.  "One instance" notifications/alerts include:
         DC ORDER
         DNR EXPIRING
         FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION
         MEDICATIONS EXPIRING
         NEW ORDER
         NPO DIET MORE THAN 72 HRS
         ORDER REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE
         UNVERIFIED MEDICATION ORDER
         UNVERIFIED ORDER
  
 So at any point in time, an alert recipient can only have one instance of
 each of these notifications/alerts for any given patient.  For example, 
 Dr. Smith can only have one instance of the New Order alert for Patient 
 Jones at any one time.  He can have a New Order alert for Patient Brown 
 at the same time but only one New Order alert for each patient.  This 
 prevents recipients from being over-loaded with common alerts like New
 Order and Order Requires Electronic Signature. In the past, when one of
 these alerts was triggered, the old alert was deleted and the recipients
 of the earlier alert were added as potential recipients of the new
 alert.  This caused problems because sometimes recipients of the earlier
 alert were no longer associated with the patient.  (ASH-0301-30536,
 MAC-0301-61079, MAR-0501-20171, CPH-0801-40144, AUG-0701-31735,
 UNY-0600-11666, SHR-0901-71584.)  Patch OR*3*105 solved most of these
 problems but exceptions were found where previous recipients should
 have been kept (DUB-0202-30018.)
  
 To simplify the process and make it more logical to users, the method for
 determining which earlier alert recipients should be added to the new
 alert will be as follows:
 - When a new instance of the alert is triggered, each of the new alert
 recipients are checked to see if he/she has a previous, UNDELETED version
 of the alert.  If so, the earlier alert is deleted for that user only.
 - The earlier alert is not deleted for earlier recipients who are not
 recipients of the new alert.
  
 This keeps only one version of the alert per recipient, per patient.  It
 also prevents deleting the alert for individuals who still need to take
 alert action but may no longer be linked to the patient (DUB-0202-30018.)
  
 4. Adds the new parameter ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER.  This new parameter
 supports Kernel Alert functionality that allows users to identify a user
 (backup reviewer) to receive unattended alerts after x days.  The new 
 parameter indicates how many days to wait before forwarding an alert to 
 the backup reviewer.  (Specifying a user's backup reviewer is 
 described in patch XU*8*174.)  This is similar to current functionality
 which forwards alerts to a user's surrogate or supervisor.  The value
 exported with this patch for each OE/RR notification/alert on your system
 is 0 (zero.)  A zero indicates the notification/alert will never be
 forwarded to the backup reviewer.  This new parameter does not affect TIU
 and non-OE/RR alerts.
  
  *** You must change the parameter value for each notification/alert your
 site intends to be forwarded to the backup reviewer ***
  
 Change the parameter value via the Notification Mgmt menu option as 
 follows:
  
 Select OPTION NAME: ORMGR       CPRS Manager Menu     menu
  
  
    CL     Clinician Menu ...
    NM     Nurse Menu ...
    WC     Ward Clerk Menu ...
    PE     CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) ...
    IR     CPRS Configuration (IRM) ...
  
  
 Select CPRS Manager Menu Option: PE  CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord)
  
  
    ...
    NO     Notification Mgmt Menu ...
    ...
  
  
 Select CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) Option: NO  Notification Mgmt Menu
  
  
    ...
    10     Forward Notifications ...
    ... 
  
  
 Select Notification Mgmt Menu Option: 10  Forward Notifications
  
  
    1      Forward Unprocessed Notification to Supervisor
    2      Forward Unprocessed Notification to Surrogates
    3      Forward Unprocessed Notification to Bkup Reviewer   <======
  
  
 Select Forward Notifications Option: 3  Forward Unprocessed Notification 
 to Bkup Reviewer
  
  
  
            Set FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER Parameters for Notifications
  
 Holds Days before Forward to Backup may be set for the following:
  
      1   Division      DIV    [choose from INSTITUTION]
      2   System        SYS    [DEVCUR.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV]
  
 Enter selection: 2  System   DEVCUR.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV
  
  Setting Holds Days before Forward to Backup  for System: 
 DEVCUR.FO-SLC.MED.VA.GOV
 Select Notification: ORDER REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE  
 Are you adding ORDER REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE as a new Notification? 
 Yes//   YES
  
 Notification: ORDER REQUIRES ELEC SIGNATURE//   ORDER REQUIRES ELEC 
 SIGNATURE   
 Value: ?
  
 Number of days to hold notif. before fwding to recipient's backup 
 reviewer.
  
 Value: 7
  
 In this example, unread Order Requires Electronic Signature 
 notification/alerts will be forwarded to an alert recipient's backup 
 reviewer after seven days.  Specifying a user's backup reviewer is 
 described in patch XU*8*174.
  
 5. [AUG-0602-32806] Fixes a problem where the ^XTMP("ORBDUP") global grew 
 abnormally large.  In addition to the fix, the patch pre-init runs a 
 cleanup routine on ^XTMP("ORBDUP").  
  
 6. [SHR-0100-72470] Allows entry of lower and mixed case text when
 flagging orderable items to send an alert when resulted.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
 =========================
 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
 to users.  Users may be on the system during installation. On most systems
 installation will take less than 2 minutes.  Systems with heavy user loads
 or performance problems may take longer.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
    SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
    at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*139):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package OR*3.0*139.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of  
    Install? YES//', respond "YES".
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during install? YES//',
    respond "NO".
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and 
    Protocols? YES//', respond "NO".
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 10. Please note the KIDS installation process deletes the ORY139 routine
     after successful installation.
