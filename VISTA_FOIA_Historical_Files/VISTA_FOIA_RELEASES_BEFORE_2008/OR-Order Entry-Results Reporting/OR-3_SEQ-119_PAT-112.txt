 Issues:
 =======
 1. [Requested at Camp CPRS 2001]  Fixes a problem with the Unverified
 Order and Unverified Medication Order notifications/alerts. When the
 Unverified Order and Unverified Medication Order notifications/alerts are
 triggered for patients with unverified orders (medication and otherwise)
 from previous admissions, the alert follow-up action considers all
 unverified orders.  This is a problem because if any unverified order
 exists, the alert is not deleted and nursing and clerical personnel are
 reluctant to verify orders from previous admissions. This patch changes
 that by only considering the unverified orders in the current admission
 when determining if the alert should be deleted or not. If a current
 admission date/time cannot be found, only the unverified orders from the
 past 30 days are considered. Thus, with this patch the alert will be
 deleted if unverified orders exist from previous admissions but not the
 current admission (or past 30 days.)
  
 2. [Support GMRC*3*17] Adds error-prevention code to the Consult/Request
 Interpretation notification/alert follow-up action in CPRS List Manager.
 Consult/Request Interpretation is a new notification/alert introduced with
 GMRC*3*17.  Patch GMRC*3*17 does not need to be installed before this
 patch OR*3*112.
  
 3. [Support RA*5.0*28] Adds the new notification/alert IMAGING REQUEST
 CHANGED [#67].  This new notification/alert is triggered from within the
 Imaging package when a request is changed. The alert follow-up action
 displays the request before and after the change.  Alert recipients
 are determined by the Imaging package and will be the requesting
 provider(s) before and after the request is/was changed. Patch RA*5.0*28
 does NOT need to be installed before patch OR*3*112. However, the IMAGING
 REQUEST CHANGED notification/alert will not be functional until AFTER
 patch RA*5.0*28 is installed. The exported OE/RR package-level parameter
 values for this new notification are:
  
 Parameter                       Imaging Request Changed
 ---------                       --------------------------

 ORB DELETE MECHANISM            INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENT           
 ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR          0 DAYS                        
 ORB FORWARD SURROGATE           0 DAYS                        
 ORB PROCESSING FLAG             DISABLED*                      
 ORB URGENCY                     MODERATE      
  
 * The notification must be set to Enabled or Mandatory before the
 notification/alert will be triggered.  To do this use the Notification 
 Mgmt option:
  
 Select Notification Mgmt Menu Option: 1  Enable/Disable Notifications 
  
                Set PROCESSING FLAG Parameters for Notifications
  
 Processing Flag may be set for the following:
  
      1   User          USR    [choose from NEW PERSON]
      2   Team (OE/RR)  OTL    [choose from OE/RR LIST]
      3   Service       SRV    [choose from SERVICE/SECTION]
      4   Location      LOC    [choose from HOSPITAL LOCATION]
      5   Division      DIV    [choose from INSTITUTION]
      6   System        SYS    [DEVCUR.ISC-SLC.VA.GOV]
  
 Enter selection: 6  System   DEVCUR.ISC-SLC.VA.GOV

 installation will take less than 2 minutes.  Systems with heavy user loads
 or performance problems may take longer.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
    SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
    at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*112):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global

    installation is completed this routine is automatically deleted.
