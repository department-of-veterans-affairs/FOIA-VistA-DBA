Description:
============

 ******************************* N O T E *********************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the {package}-CoreFLS
 software. Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not 
 cause any problems.
  
 This patch is being released with a shortened compliance date of 
 August 11, 2004 due to potential incorrect exemptions.  If necessary, 
 this patch may be installed out of patch sequence order.
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch (IB*2.0*269) is an enhancement to the Income Verification 
 process of evaluatng and converting veterans Income Tests. It will 
 allow IVM to correctly set the medication copay required status.
  
 Existing functionality allows the Income Verification staff to convert a
 veteran's means test to either a MT or GMT copay required status. This can
 potentially result in an incorrect Medication Copay Exemption status. The
 enhancement will also allow Income Verification to convert a RX copay test
 to a status of non-exempt.  Unlike Income Verification means test
 conversions that allow back-billing to occur, conversion of a RX copay
 test to a non-exempt status will not trigger any back-billing of
 prescriptions.  Rather, any prescriptions entered on or after the date the
 RX Copay Income Verification Converted test is received will be liable
 for copayments.
  
 When the Income Verification staff converts a veteran to an RX Copay 
 Required status and the Z06 is uploaded, an entry will be added to the 
 BILLING EXEMPTION file (#354.1). This new entry will have a status of 
 non-exempt and will be set to active.  The previous status will be set to 
 inactive.   Additionally, the COPAY INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS field (#.04) 
 of the BILLING PATIENT file (#354) will reflect that the status is now 
 non-exempt.
  
 If the Income Verification staff reopen an IVM case that was converted to 
 RX Copay Required and then subsequently converted to a status such that 
 the veteran in exempt from medication copayments a "Delete Z06" will be 
 sent.   A new record will be added to the BILLING EXEMPTION file (#354.1)
 and will become active.  The prior (non-exempt) record will be set to 
 inactive. Additionally, the COPAY EXEMPTION STATUS file (#.04) of the 
 BILLING PATIENT file (#354) will reflect that the status is now exempt.
