Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2 APIS FOR OUTPATIENT PHARMACY

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will be 
 used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
 writes to the Outpatient Pharmacy files.  Since the PRESCRIPTION file 
 (#52), PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41), RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5), 
 CLOZAPINE PRESCRIPTION OVERRIDES file (#52.52), TPB ELIGIBILITY file 
 (#52.91), RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53), and OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) 
 are being replaced as part of the Pharmacy Re-engineering project, any 
 direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be replaced by 
 calling the APIs provided in this patch. When the new data source is in 
 place, the calling applications will not be required to make any changes, 
 because these APIs will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested data 
 from the new data source, when the time comes.
  
 These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
 direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
 replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
  install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy V 7.0 users are on the system.
  Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.  Suggested time to install: During
  non-peak requirement hours for Outpatient Pharmacy users.  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*213) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*213.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
