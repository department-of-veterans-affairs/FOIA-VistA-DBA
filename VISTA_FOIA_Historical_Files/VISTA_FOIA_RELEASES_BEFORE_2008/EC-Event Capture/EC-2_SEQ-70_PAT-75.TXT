 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000092007:        Cannot select provider in PROVIDER (1-3) Summary
                         Report.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Cannot select provider in PROVIDER (1-3) Summary Report. If we try the report
 in the Vista roll and scroll option, we can select this provider. When
 using the GUI, this provider's name does not appear in the Provider list.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PROV^ECUMRPC2 was modified so that all providers will be displayed 
 for the PROVIDER (1-3) Summary Report. 
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000094735:      Problem with ECS GUI option data entry by procedure
  
 Problem:
 --------
 We are having problems with the Data Entry by Procedure option in ECS GUI.
 After entering the procedure code if your DSS Unit does not have a default
 time or if you change the default time, the procedure field is deleted and
 you have to enter it again. After you enter the procedure field a second
 time it will stay or if you enter the time before the procedure it works
 okay.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The data entry by procedure form was modified by changing the order of the
 Procedure and Procedure Date/Time fields.
