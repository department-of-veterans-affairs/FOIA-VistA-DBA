 PATCH OVERVIEW
 ---------------
  
 The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
 Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
 ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic 
 transmission of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers 
 and the receipt of claim responses (including drug utilization review 
 responses and warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and 
 introduced in a phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy 
 was utilized due to the complexity of the functionality and the number of 
 product line dependencies.
  
 The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1.0, comprised 
 of the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
 namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
 PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation. BPS*1.0 is 
 a dormant release that only allows each site to perform preliminary setup 
 work and to confirm that the software does not adversely affect other 
 packages.
  
 There are two main areas addressed by BPS*1*0:
  
 a. Registration of the Pharmacy with the Vitria BusinessWare IE.
 b. The Insurance Matching of Group Plans with Pharmacy Plans
  
 Following the installation of BPS*1.0, each site must register their            
 pharmacy with Vitria and match applicable insurance group plans using the 
 insurance matching screens. These processes are detailed in the HIPAA 
 NCPDP CONNECTION FOR EDI PHARMACY (Dormant Release) INSTALLATION GUIDE and
 the E-PHARMACY CLAIMS INSURANCE PROCESS document. Both of these documents
 are located on the anonymous directory. It is very important that the IRM
 or person installing the patch at each facility provide a copy of these
 documents to its ADPAC(s) and any other relevant staff who will be
 responsible for registering their pharmacy with Vitria and completing the
 insurance matching process.
  
 At a later date, additional HIPAA NCPDP patches will be released to 
 activate all of the HIPAA NCPDP functionality. Until that time, sites 
 will not be able to electronically submit claims utilizing this new 
 functionality.
  
 The HIPAA NCPDP project was created in response to a Chief Business 
 Office (CBO) request for modifications to several Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) software 
 applications in accordance with HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 
 transactions and NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically the NCPDP 
 Telecommunication Standard v.5.1.
  
 The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.
  
  
 Functional Description
 -----------------------
  
 The patch PRCA*4.5*202 represents the Accounts Receivable portion of the 
 NCPDP-Pharmacy Connection project. It modifies the EDI Lockbox 
 functionality by adding the ability to manually process EOB related to
 NCPDP claims.
  
 The patch modifies Accounts Receivable (AR) users interface to make it
 possible to select bills by entering NCPDP Prescription/Service Reference
 Numbers.
  
 When working with "Receipt Processing" [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] and 
 "Link Payment to Account" [RCDP LINK PAYMENT TO ACCOUNT] menu options,
 users normally enter the Bill Number or the Patient Name corresponding to
 the processed payment.
  
 The users prompt to that input is:
  
 PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER:
  
 Although the prompt is asking for a Patient Name or a Bill Number, 
 there are some other types of data that may be entered to identify 
 the corresponding bill. Previously the choices were:
  
 - Tricare Authorization Number;
 - Prescription Number. 
  
 This patch adds one more type of data that can be entered to identify a 
 Bill. The "ECME Number", the Prescription/Service Reference Number, 
 indicated in the NCPDP Electronic Claim, can now be entered to identify 
 the bill.
  
 The help text for the above user's prompt has been modified to provide 
 a better explanation of the expected input:
  
 PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER: ?
      Enter one of following: Patient Name, Bill No, Tricare Authorization No,
      ECME Rx Reference Number or Prescription Number.
 PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER: 
  
 If the users input is not a Bill Number and not a Patient Name, and is 
 recognized as a Tricare Authorization Number, Prescription Number or a
 ECME Number, the subsequent user's prompt will be respectively:
  
 Is this TRICARE reference number - 123456? No//
 Is this prescription number - 123456? No//
 Is this ECME Rx reference number - 123456? No//
  
  
 Technical Description
 ----------------------
 The patch modifies the procedure PNORBILL^RCDPURED, which is called from 
 the Data Dictionary of the file #344 (sub-file #344.01). It calls the IB 
 procedure REC^IBRFN, which was also modified by this project (patch 
 IB*2.0*223) to support ECME Numbers.
 To provide a more clear users interface, the IB procedure REC^IBRFN will 
 be returning a flag - the second formal parameter by reference,
 indicating, how the users input was recognized: Tricare Authorization 
 Number, Prescription Number, or the ECME Number. The consequent users 
 prompt will indicate that. 
  
 Routine RCDPESR1 modifies the EDI LockBox AR functionality to 
 add capability of matching ECME number to IB bill automatically.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 ==========================
  
 1. Use VA FileMan to add the new domain, EPHARMACY.VITRIA-EDI.AAC.VA.GOV, 
 to the DOMAIN file (#4.2). The installation instructions are included in 
 the patch description for the XM*DBA*160 patch. This domain must be in 
 place before the installation of the IB*2*251 patch that is included in 
 the BPS 1.0 Master Build.
  
 2. Download the KIDS file BPS_1_0.KID via FTP. This file needs to be 
 retrieved in ASCII format.
  
 3. Review mapped sets for the PSS*, IB*, and PRCA*namespaces.  If the 
 routines are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this 
 time.
   
 4. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the 
 Installation menu.
  
 5.  From this menu, select the Load a Distribution option. When prompted 
 for a file name, enter 
 the directory name where you FTPd the build, followed by BPS_1_0. In our 
 example, the file name is USER$:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_0.KID. Determine the 
 location where you stored your build to decide the correct file name 
 entry.
  
 6. At the "Want to Continue with Load? YES//" prompt, enter YES.
  
 7. At the "Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine: YES//" prompt, 
 answer YES.
  
 8. From this menu, the installer may select to use the following options:
  
 (When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter BPS 1.0)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
 message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
 other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
 allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
 installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
 templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure the 
 integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 9. At the "Select Installation Option:" prompt, enter 6 Install Package(s)
  
 10. At the "Select INSTALL NAME:" prompt, enter BPS 1.0.
  
 11. When prompted, "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
 Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
 12. When prompted, "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
 YES//" respond NO.
  
 13. When prompted, "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 14. When prompted, "Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
 NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 15. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be returned 
 to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
