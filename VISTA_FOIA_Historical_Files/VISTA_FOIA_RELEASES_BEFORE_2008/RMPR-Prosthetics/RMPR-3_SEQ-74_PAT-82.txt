Description:
============

 ******************************N O T E************************************
 This patch has *NO* conflict with the COREFLS environment for Prosthetics
 *************************************************************************
      
 This patch addresses NOIS issues discovered in the 
 Prosthetics package described below.
      
 Issue #1
 TUC-0402-61537 error solved/no email
 ALB-0402-51646 Error in PCE interface
      
 Problem
 -------
 Both NOIS calls TUC-0402-61537 and ALB-0402-51646 request that when the
 Prosthetics Background PCE job is run, a more descriptive message be
 displayed in the e-mail that is sent to the specified mail group.  The
 NOIS requests that the e-mail message be similar to the message displayed 
 when running the background job from the menu option [RMPR PCE
 BACKGROUND TASK].
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to enhance the email message by adding
 the following fields and text:
      
 *** NAME = XXXXXXX,XXXX X   ENTRY DATE = XXX XX, XXXX
 *** Clinic is not defined....Please ask your ADPAC to enter a prosthetics
 *** clinic in the Prosthetics Site Parameters file for station # = XXX
 *** Using option 'Enter/Edit Station Site Parameters'
      
 The NAME field will be the name of the patient that corresponds to the
 IEN being reported from the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE (#660)
 and the ENTRY DATE will be the date that the 660 transaction was entered
 into the system.
      
 Issue #2
 NOIS Call - LOM-0703-61703 ENTIRE SSN PRINTING ON CORRESPONDENCE
      
 Problem
 -------
 The Patient Correspondence Letter and Patient Notification Letter both
 print the full Social Security Number.  This is thought to be a security 
 issue and a request has been made to remove SSN from both letters.  
 Patient Correspondence Letter is [RMPR CORR VIEW]
 Patient Notification Letter is [2421 FORM] (Prompted from within option)
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routines RMPRFO, RMPRFO3, RMPRFO6 and
 RMPRP24 to remove the SSN.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================
      
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.

     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
