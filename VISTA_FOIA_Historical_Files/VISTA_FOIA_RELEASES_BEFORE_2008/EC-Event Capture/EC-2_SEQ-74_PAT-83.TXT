Subject: CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF [EC NIGHT] OPTION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 EC*2.0*83 is an informational patch. The Director of the Nutrition and Food
 Service with concurrence from the Director of Development-DSS Support Office 
 has requested a change to the frequency of the Event Capture "Nightly Data 
 Feed to PCE" [EC NIGHT] background job. This job currently has a recommended 
 frequency of once per night. 
  
   
 Problem:
 ========
 The Event Capture "Nightly Data Feed to PCE" [EC NIGHT] background job runs 
 once per day and as a result encounters are not available to providers in a 
 timely manner for the linking of progress notes to the encounter as well as 
 other review activities.  
   
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The recommendation is to have the sites change this frequency from once per 
 day to every 60 to 180 seconds (1-3 minutes). Changing the frequency will 
 have the following benefits -
 1) It will result in encounters being created and available in PCE to 
    providers in a more timely fashion and allow corrections of any entry
    errors identified almost immediately, and still have the encounter
    completed in a timely manner.
 2) It will facilitate the signing of progress notes and closing out of 
    encounters the same day rather than this process having to wait until 
    possibly the next day.
 3) It will reduce the likelihood of creating duplicate encounters and lessen 
    the number of encounters added to the list of "action required" within 
    Scheduling. When providers are forced to wait as long as a day before 
    encounters are created in PCE, it adds to the providers' workload and 
    increases the probability of mistakes such as forgetting to enter the 
    exact date and time of the appointment from the Scheduling package. 
 
 
 Example:
 ========
 NOTE: Prior to changing the frequency of the "Nightly Data Feed to PCE" [EC 
       NIGHT] option, it's recommended that the nightly job runs at its 
       regularly scheduled time, after which the frequency can then be changed.
 
 Changing the frequency of the EC NIGHT option can be accomplished as follows -
