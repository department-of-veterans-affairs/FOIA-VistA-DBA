Subject: IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY / INCORRECT DATA RANGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects a problem with the range selection in the First Party
 Follow-Up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY] option.
   
  ASSOCIATED NOIS:
  ---------------
  1. OKL-1001-73313     [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY] incorrect Data (0 to n 
                        Range)

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1. OKL-1001-73313     [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY] incorrect Data (0 to n
                        Range)
   
    Problem:
    -------
    When executing the First Party Follow-up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP
    FIRST PARTY] option one of the prompts/options ask if the report
    should include all AR's or those AR's in an age Range. The software
    that builds the report expects the range to be in whole numbers of
    "1" or greater. When the range is entered with a "0" as the minimum
    number of days, it gets lost and returns a report with erroneous
    data.
   
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The routine that prompts the user for the "AR age range" has been
    modified to give an example of an expected range and also modified
    to accept "1" as the lowest minimum number of days.  Zero is no
    longer allowed as a minimum number in the range. The help screen has 
    been modified to remind the user that zero is not a valid entry.
