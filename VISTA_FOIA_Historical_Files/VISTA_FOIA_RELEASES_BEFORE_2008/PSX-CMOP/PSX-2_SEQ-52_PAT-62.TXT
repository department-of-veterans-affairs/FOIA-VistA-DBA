Subject: HIPAA/NCPDP - CHECK RX PREVIOUS FILL BEFORE TRANSMITTING FILL TO CMOP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
  
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.
  
 This patch modifies the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) 
 application in the following ways:
  
 1) The process responsible for transmitting of prescriptions to the 
    CMOP facilities was changed to perform the following check: 
  
    For ePharmacy prescriptions only, before a fill can be transmitted to 
    the CMOP facility, the previous fill cannot be pending to be filled at
    the CMOP facility. For example, before transmitting refill 1 to the 
    CMOP facility, the software will check if the original is currently
    being filled by CMOP. If so, the refill 1 will be held until the 
    original fill process is completed by the CMOP facility. 
  
 2) Changed the second line of the routine PSXVND by adding the patch
    numbers 1 and 2 to the list of patches. These patch numbers were
    unintentionally removed by patch PSX*2*48.

  2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific
     server as follows: 
   
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
