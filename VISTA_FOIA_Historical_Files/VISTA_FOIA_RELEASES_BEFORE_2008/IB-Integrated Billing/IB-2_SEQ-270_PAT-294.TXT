Subject: MRA ISSUES RESOLUTION - STATS REPORT & EXTRA HCFA CLAIM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects problems related to the Medicare Remittance Advice 
 (MRA) software.
  
 1.  The MRA Statistics report changes and fixes include the following:
   - Display totals data for all divisions or all selected divisions;
   - Include MRA request transmissions that were transmitted on the same 
     date as the report ending date;
   - Only include MRA request transmissions within the date range and not 
     MRA secondary transmissions destined for the secondary payer.
  
 2.  When completing an institutional UB92 claim, the system checks to see 
 if a corresponding professional HCFA-1500 claim should be created.  If an 
 existing professional HCFA-1500 claim is already on file, the system does 
 not create a new one.  A bug was preventing the system from recognizing 
 that a professional HCFA-1500 claim was already on file and a new claim 
 was mistakenly created.  This patch prevents a new claim from being 
 created under these circumstances.
