Subject: Prosthetics/Scheduling Encapsulation

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1) This patch is the Prosthetics support patch for the upcoming Scheduling
 Redesign effort.  It removes unused code, options and protocols that
 reference Scheduling but are deemed no longer necessary by the National
 Prosthetics Data Validation Group.
  
 2) This patch extends the error message returned from the
 supported call SDA^VADPT, also in support of Scheduling Redesign.
  
 3) RMPR Sched - H/L Visit menu text is modified to reflect a name change
 that was necessary due to the removal of half its options.
