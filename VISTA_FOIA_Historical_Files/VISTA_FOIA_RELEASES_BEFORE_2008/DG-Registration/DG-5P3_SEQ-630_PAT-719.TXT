Subject: RESTORE PATIENT INQUIRY TREATING SPECIALTY DISPLAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*683 made a change to the DG Patient Inquiry lookup 
 functionality so that it would use the Treating Specialty Code PRINT NAME
 within the Specialty file (42.4) instead of the Treating Specialty Code
 NAME within the Facility Treating Specialty file (45.7).  This change was
 made because all of the Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) Treating Specialty
 Codes begin with either NH SHORT STAY or NH LONG STAY.  Due to lack of
 real estate within the Patient Inquiry screen some of the codes displayed
 as such.  This change has caused conflict with standard operating
 procedures at several sites.  
  
 This patch will restore the previous Patient Inquiry lookup functionality.
 Sites will have the opportunity to create custom Treating Specialty Codes
 within the Facility Treating Specialty file (45.7) to make the NHCU
 Treating Specialty Codes more descriptive and site specific if necessary.
