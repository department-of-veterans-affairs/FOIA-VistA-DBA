Description:
============

  
 ********************* WARNING **********************
 *****************************************************
 If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface 
 from ILC this patch will overwrite any "local" modifications 
 in routine PSJCOM. This could affect certain orders being 
 sent across this interface.  The modifications will have to 
 be reintroduced following installation of this patch.
 ******************************************************
 ******************************************************
  
 This patch addresses Remedy ticket HD158508 (PSI 06 125) and its duplicate
 tickets.  When an order with Special Instructions was entered, and when
 prompted, the order was finished such that the BCMA message box flag was
 set.  Therefore, when the medication is to be administered in BCMA, a
 pop-up message box would appear to the nurse displaying the Special
 Instructions.  The order was then renewed via CPRS.  After FINISHING the order
 in backdoor pharmacy, and before ACCEPTING the order, the Special
 Instructions were deleted in the edit function.  The order was then Accepted 
 and Verified.  While the Special Instructions text was deleted, the BCMA 
 message box flag remained set.  When the nurse entered BCMA to administer 
 the medication of the renewed order, BCMA behaved as though the medication 
 was given even though not marked as given.  No Special Instruction pop-up
 box appeared. The medication was NOT marked as GIVEN on the VDL 
 (virtual due list).  The underlying issue is that while the Special 
 Instructions were deleted, the flag to display the BCMA message box was not 
 cleared which created the issue of medication not being marked as given.  
  
 The actual problem lies within the Inpatient Meds code that clears the
 Special Instructions when deleted during the FINISHING process.  The
 current code only sets the Special Instructions field to null when it is
 deleted and does not consider the BCMA message box flag.  The fixes
 contained within this patch will clear the BCMA message box flag  if
 the special instructions are null.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
  
 HD158508
  
 Problem
 --------
 When the Special Instructions are flagged to display a BCMA Message Box, and 
 when the instructions are deleted on a renewed order during the FINISHING
 process, the BCMA Message Box flag is not cleared.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 This patch will clear the BCMA Message Box flag if the Special Instructions
 are deleted.
  
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
 The routine PSGOEF1 was be updated such that if the first piece of the
 PSGSI variable is null, it re-sets the ^PS(53.1,DA,6 node for the
 order and sets the second piece to null as well.  Currently, if the
 Special Instructions (first piece) is set, the second piece (BCMA
 Message Box) flag remains set.
  
 Routine PSJCOM has been updated with the same code as PSJOEF1.
  
  
 The PSJBCMA* API routines PSJBCMA and PSJBCMA1 have been updated so that 
 if the Special Instructions are null, the second piece is also set to null, 
 and the ! flag is not sent to BCMA to denote that a pop-up message box is 
 expected.  In these routines, both the unit dose and the IV sections will 
 be updated.
  
 A new routine named PSJ0186 was added to this patch which will allow the 
 sites to determine how many orders were affected by this issue.
  
 **NOTE** The routine PSJ0186 will NOT update or correct any records
 that it finds and prints on the report.
  
  
 The features of PSJ0186 are:
 1. Select a device - a printer, P-message, or file.
 2. Queue the output
 3. Print in human-readable or comma-delimited format
 4. Select All orders or only Active orders.  If ALL orders is selected,
    the output of the report will start from the date that PSB*3*13 was
    installed at the site going forward.  If Only Active Orders is 
    selected, the report will display any orders with a STOP DATE
    within the last 7 days, a STOP DATE of Today, or a STOP DATE any time
    in the future.
 5. If no orders are found, the report prints "Nothing to print".
  
 This routine can be run either from the programmer's prompt, or a new
 stand alone menu option [PSJU SI SEARCH] included with this patch.
