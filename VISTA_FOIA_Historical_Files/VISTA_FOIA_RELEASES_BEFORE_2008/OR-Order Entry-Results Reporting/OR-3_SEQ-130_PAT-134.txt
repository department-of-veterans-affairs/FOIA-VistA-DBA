Subject: OUTPT MED, IV FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects three problems in the CPRS/Pharmacy interface, with
 outpatient medication and IV orders.
  
 PROBLEMS and Related NOIS:
 ==========================
 1. V02-1201-N1957  OP RX NOT CONVERTING CORRECTLY ON RENEWAL
 Prior to the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project, any changes 
 made to an outpatient medication order by the pharmacist that did not 
 trigger a new order were not saved with the order in the Orders file #100 
 or reflected on the Orders tab in CPRS; one of the values that could be 
 changed without a new order was the dispense drug.  When one of these 
 orders is now renewed, the original (now incorrect) dispense drug is 
 being carried over into the new order by CPRS, confusing pharmacists and 
 providers and creating the potential for errors.  This patch adds a check 
 to the renewal of a prescription, and will prevent it if the dispense 
 drugs in CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy do not match.
 NOTE:  Patch PSO*7*96 is also required for this functionality to be 
 implemented; it is not, however, required for installation of this patch.
  
 2. POR-0102-50827  Where is rate information stored for IV orders?
 A recent Kernel patch added the ADDITIONAL PREFIXES multiple to the 
 Package file #9.4; entries in this multiple are also included in the "C" 
 cross reference on package namespace, which CPRS uses to find specific 
 entries in this file.  This multiple has now been populated with entries 
 PSG and PSIV for the Inpatient Medications package, but that can cause 
 CPRS to come up with the wrong value when trying to find the pointer for 
 the IV Medications (PSIV) package.  This patch fixes the lookup on the 
 "C" cross reference to make sure it is finding the correct entry and not 
 the Additional Prefix entry.
  
 3. TOG-0102-12405  SERVICE CONNECTED CONDITION CHECK BOX NOT SHOW IN GUI
 The Medication Copay changes released in OR*3*116 inadvertently omitted 
 the display of the patient's current service connection data with the 
 prompt "Is this order for treatment related to a service connected 
 condition".  Also, the copay questions were not being asked at all in the 
 List Manager interface if the order was being delayed for discharge.  
 Both of these issues are now resolved with this patch.
  
 4. ISB-0202-30541  Renewing an order after a NDF update
 Prior to this patch, inpatient medication orders with a now inactive 
 orderable item could not be renewed; patch PSJ*5*70 will now return a 
 replacement item to CPRS when available, and this patch will use the new 
 item and allow the renewal order to be placed.
  
 5. BIR-0202-30805  0..5 IN ORDER
 This patch contains a fix that will stop the incorrect "on the fly" 
 conversion of fractional doses for pre-POE orders.  In addition, a 
 post-init will identify all currently active orders that have a SIG that 
 contains 0..
  
 The post-init will go through the AC xref, which is all active orders
 along with orders that are still on the list due to the active orders
 context hours parameter.  A list of all problematic orders will be sent to
 the initiator along with all holders of the PSNMGR key.  A pharmacist will
 have to take the appropriate action on the order.  A guideline is included
 in the post-init message which suggests how the problems may be fixed.
  
 6. Renewal of complex outpatient order produces incorrect SIG
 Currently, if you renew a complex outpatient medication order in the GUI,
 the SIG for the renewal will build incorrectly.  Patch PSO*7*101 will 
 clean up any currently existing incorrect SIGs created as a result of 
 this problem.

 The post-init will go through the AC xref, which is all active orders
 along with orders that are still on the list due to the active orders
 context hours parameter.  A list of all problematic orders will be sent to
 the initiator along with all holders of the PSNMGR key.  A pharmacist will
 have to take the appropriate action on the order.  A guideline is included
 in the post-init message which suggests how the problems may be fixed.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*134):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package OR*3.0*134.
