Associated patches: (v)IVM*2*93    <<= must be installed BEFORE `IVM*2*119'

Subject: IVM Address Updates for Active Rx

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Address updates are sent to the sites from the Health Eligibility Center 
 (HEC) using an ORU~Z05 Address Demographic HL7 Transmission.  When the 
 veteran has an active prescription on file at the site, the address 
 update is not automatically accepted.  These records are stored in the 
 IVM UPLOAD DEM option for manual review.
  
 The sites have fourteen days to either accept or reject the address 
 updates in the IVM UPLOAD DEM option.  Currently, after the fourteen 
 days, the address is automatically accepted, uploaded and transmitted 
 back to the HEC regardless of the ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM of the shared 
 data.  This is done from a process within the nightly IVM BACKGROUND JOB 
 option.  
  
 Because of the number of patient addresses being overwritten with older 
 address data, the CBO decided it would be best to change the way uploads 
 are processed by the software after 14 days have passed with no action 
 taken in the IVM UPLOAD DEM option.  This change does not affect the user 
 process; just the automated process when no action has been taken.
  
 Issue #1:
 =========
 When the records have not been reviewed (manually accepted or rejected), 
 the address is updated.  This is causing many prescriptions to be sent to 
 an inaccurate address.  
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE PSI-06-156 documented the issue as follows:
     There were some medications sent to wrong addresses, and some were
     returned and had to be destroyed. There were some patients who did
     not receive necessary medications as expected.
  
 This patch (IVM*2.0*119) will be implementing a change to criteria for 
 automatic uploading of the addresses after the fourteen day period has 
 expired from the nightly IVM BACKGROUND JOB option. The address update 
 records in IVM UPLOAD DEM will be checked to verify if the veteran has an 
 active prescription on file at the site.  If there is one or more, the 
 update will be rejected and the current address on file will be 
 transmitted to the HEC and shared with all sites visited even if the data 
 received had a more recent ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM.
  
 This focus of this patch (IVM*2*119) is to block to the automatic upload 
 of address changes from the nightly IVM BACKGROUND JOB for veterans with 
 active prescriptions on file.
  
 The IVM UPLOAD DEM Enhancement Project (patch IVM*2.0*117) is currently 
 on-hold for Address Healthcare Failure Mode Effect Analysis (HFMEA).  
 This project will be implementing the modifications necessary to support 
 the findings of the HFEMA.
  
 Issue #2:
 =========
 After patch IVM*2*106 was released it was discovered that address uploads 
 by the IVM BACKGROUND JOB were not included in the IVM ADDRESS CHANGE LOG 
 Report.  
  
 The software is being modified to store those updates in the IVM ADDRESS 
 CHANGE LOG file (#301.7) as well as display them on the report.
