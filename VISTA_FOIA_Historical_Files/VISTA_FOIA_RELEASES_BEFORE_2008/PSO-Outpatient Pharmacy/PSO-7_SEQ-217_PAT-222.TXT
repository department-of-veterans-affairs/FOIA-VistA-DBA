Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs National Clozapine Coordinating Center 
 (NCCC), is requesting modifications to Veterans Health Information Systems
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) Outpatient Pharmacy and Mental Health
 applications to meet revisions in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 monitoring requirements for blood monitoring in patients being treated
 with Clozapine.
  
 This patch PSO*7*222 is associated with the MENTAL HEALTH V. 5.01 patch
 YS*5.01*90 and patch YS*5.01*90 is a required patch for PSO*7*222. Please
 read the patch description of YS*5.01*90 for complete details of this new
 enhancement.
  
 This Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*222 contains the following
 must-do-work enhancements for Clozapine dispensing:
  
 1. Adjust the business rules to disallow prescription processing without
    override if 3500/mm3>WBC>3000/mm3 and 2000/mm3>ANC>1500/mm3.
    These levels require twice weekly blood testing until the WBC 
    stabilizes above 3500/mm3 and ANC above 2000/mm3 with no signs of 
    infection.
 2. Modify routine logic to recognize the new monthly status and apply the
    appropriate restrictions for lab draw checks. 
 3. Add a new field to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to store ANC value and
    modify routine logic to require both a WBC and ANC be drawn and 
    reported before drug dispensing is allowed. 
 4. Modify routine logic to prevent local users from editing the Patient
    Status within Clozapine module.
    
 This patch transports the following fields:
 1. The field length of the WBC RESULT field (#302) of the PRESCRIPTION
    file (#52) is modified from 3 to 5 digits to accommodate values up to
    99999 as these values will be stored in 1000s. 
 2. A new field ANC RESULTS field (#304) is added to the PRESCRIPTION file
    (#52) to store the ANC test value.
 3. The field name of REASON FOR LOCKOUT field (#4) of the CLOZAPINE
    PRESCRIPTION OVERRIDES file (#52.52) is changed to REASON FOR OVERRIDE.
    The set of codes have been modified and three new codes were added to 
    accommodate the override conditions for the new ANC LAB test.
    
    The current Data Dictionary (DD) is as follows:
    52.52,4       REASON FOR LOCKOUT     0;5 SET (Required)
  
                  '1' FOR NO WBC RESULTS IN PREVIOUS 7 DAYS;
                  '2' FOR NO VERIFIED WBC RESULTS IN PREVIOUS 7 D AYS;
                  '3' FOR LAST WBC RESULT LESS THAN 3500;
                  '4' FOR THREE SEQUENTIAL WBC RESULTS DECREASING TO LESS
                          THAN 5000;
    
    The modified DD is as follows:
    52.52,4       REASON FOR OVERRIDE    0;5 SET (Required)
                  '1' FOR NO WBC IN LAST 7 DAYS;
                  '2' FOR NO VERIFIED WBC;
                  '3' FOR LAST WBC RESULT < 3500;
                  '4' FOR 3 SEQ. WBC DECREASE;
                  '5' FOR LAST ANC RESULT < 2000;
                  '6' FOR 3 SEQ. ANC DECREASE ;
                  '7' FOR NCCC AUTHORIZED;
  
  
 The Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*227, TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT
 (TPB) inactivation, was placing the TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO
 TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option out of order. Sites testing patch PSO*7*227 
 recommended that we remove this task totally from the OPTION SCHEDULING
 file (#19.2). Therefore, a post-install routine (PSOP222) is included in
 this patch PSO*7*222 to delete the TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO
 TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option from the OPTION SCHEDULING file (#19.2).
 The post-install routine will also provide the following changes:
 1. As the patch PSO*7*227 inactivated the TPB functionality, the security
    access codes for the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) still remains open.
    These codes will be changed to "@" sign restricting access to
    programmers only.
 2. The read access code of the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
    is currently set to "@" sign (programmer access). As per the
    Electronic, Error and Enhancement Report (E3R) 19725 request, this will
    be changed to "Pp" (Pharmacy Package) access.
