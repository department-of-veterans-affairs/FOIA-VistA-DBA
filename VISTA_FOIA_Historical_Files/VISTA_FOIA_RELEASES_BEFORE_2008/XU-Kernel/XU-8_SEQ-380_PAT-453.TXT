Subject: NPI Crosswalk extract modifications

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ********************************************************************** 
 WARNING: In order to obtain the most accurate extract data for Pharmacy 
 sites, it is highly recommended that patch PSO*7*273 be installed prior 
  to this patch.
 **********************************************************************
  
 Please note, Kernel patch XU*8.0*453 is not introducing a new NPI 
 Extract.  It is modifying an existing one.  XU*8.0*453 contains
 changes to the NPI Crosswalk Extract released as patch XU*8.0*452.
 As before, NPI numbers and associated demographics are pulled from the
 INSTITUTION file (#4), the NEW PERSON file (#200), and the
 IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file (#355.93) from each VA Medical
 Center.  The extracted data is aggregated and moved to a secure database
 that can be accessed by the CBO.  The extracted data is formatted into an 
 encrypted and password protected Excel spreadsheet and sent to the payers 
 via a CD.  This Excel data file can then be loaded into the NPI Crosswalk 
 file at every payer, thus enabling them to crosswalk the new NPI to a 
 provider's legacy payer ID. Verifications that the NPI Crosswalk Extract
 has run will now be sent to designated mail groups.
  
 The modifications are as follows: 
  
 1. Running the NPI Crosswalk Extract: 
    Running of the extract will be set up by the IRM to run on a quarterly 
    basis.  
  
 2. Extract all NPIs: 
    Each run of the extract shall extract all NPI data every run rather than 
    just new and updated NPI records.  
  
 3. Extract Verification Mail-Group: 
    Mail groups will be setup to receive emails verifying that the extracts 
    have been run. The first mail-group "NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION" will be 
    setup at the local site as part of a post install routine. The person 
    installing the patch will be made a member of this mail group. An 
    additional VA OUTLOOK mail group, "vhaconpiextractmonitoring", has been 
    set up to receive verification emails as well. The VA OULOOK mail-group 
    will be a member of the mail-group set up at the sites. The CBO will 
    control the members of this VA OUTLOOK mail group.  
  
 4. Pharmacy Station Number: 
    The NPI Crosswalk extract for the Institution file (#4) has been updated
    to more accurately report the station number for institutions with a
    FACILITY TYPE of Pharmacy.  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION 
  
 Following the installation of this patch, the IRM will need to use the
 schedule option XUS NPI EXTRACT through TaskMan. 
  
 Scheduling of the extract will now be on a quarterly basis. A verification
 that the extract has run will now be sent to a mail group at the site for
 the IRM and VA Outlook for the CBO.
