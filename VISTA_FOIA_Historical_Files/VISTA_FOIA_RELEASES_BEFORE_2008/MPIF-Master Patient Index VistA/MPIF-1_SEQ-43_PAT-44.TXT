Subject: MPI CHANGES 3 & MPI CHANGES 4 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE: RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
        systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up
        as Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*25, MPIF*1.0*35, MPIF*1.0*43, and MPIF*1.0*45, are required
  builds for patch MPIF*1*44.
   
  Issue 1:  As part of the MPI CHANGES 3 project, it was requested that
  PSEUDO SSN REASON be included in the ZPD segment sent from the VistA
  sites in the Health Level Seven (HL7) messages ADT-A24, ADT-A28 and
  ADT-A31.  Routines MPIFA24B, MPIFA28, and MPIFA31B have been modified
  to support this request.
  
  Issue 2:  As part of the MPI CHANGES 3 project, it was requested
  that the fields prompted for review/verification during Load/Edit Patient
  Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA], Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] and
  Electronic 10-10EZ Processing [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING], include PSEUDO
  SSN REASON when the reason is null and there is a pseudo SSN.  If the SSN
  is a pseudo SSN and the reason is not null, the SSN should NOT be
  included in the fields prompted for unless the PSEUDO SSN REASON is SSN
  UNKNOWN/FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED.  Routine MPIFAPI has been modified to support
  this request.  NOTE: The PSEUDO SSN REASON (.0906) field in the PATIENT
  (#2) file is distributed in patch DG*5.3*653.  The functionality listed
  in Issue 2 will not be available until that patch is installed.
  
  Issue 3  It was identified by the Registration Eligibility Group
  project team that HL specific variables were being killed in MPIFA31B
  inappropriately.  This is being tracked in ClearQuest CodeCR REEG_00004612.
  Routine MPIFA31B has been modified to support this change.
  
  Issue 4:  As part of the MPI CHANGES 4 project, it was requested that
  new criteria for calculating the primary view score be passed to the
  MPI in the A04, A08, A19, and A31 Health Level Seven (HL7) messages. 
  Routine MPIFA31B has been modified to support this effort.
   
  Issue 5:  In the MPI CHANGES 4 project, the concept of a "CMOR facility"
  is being phased out and will be replaced by "Primary View" for identity
  elements when the Master Patient Index (MPI) patch MPI*1.0*40 is installed
  on the Austin MPI.  All VistA options related to "CMOR" are obsolete.
  The following options have been placed OUT OF ORDER.  The OUT OF ORDER
  MESSAGE field for these options is marked as "Obsolete with MPIF*1.0*44."
  Obsolete options will be removed from the menu structure at a future date.
   
      Site Parameters Edit for CMOR' [MPIF SITE PARAMETER]
      Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) Request  [MPIF CMOR MGR]
      Create a New CMOR Change Request [MPIF NEW REQUEST]
      Push CMOR Request [MPIF PUSH CMOR]
      Edit Open CMOR Change Request [MPIF EDIT REQUEST]
      Review Pending Change of CMOR Requests [MPIF REVIEW REQUEST]
      Batch Review of CMOR Change Requests [MPIF BATCH REVIEW]
      Display a CMOR Change Request [MPIF VIEW REQUEST]
      Report - Pending Received Requests [MPIF RECEIVED REQUESTS]
      Report - Sent Requests Still Pending [MPIF SENT REQUESTS]
      Report - CMOR Requests Disapproved [MPIF DISAPPROVE REPORT]
      Report - CMOR Requests Approved [MPIF APPROVED REPORT]
      AUTO CHANGE CMOR NIGHT JOB [MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB]
   
  If the AUTO CHANGE CMOR NIGHT JOB [MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB] option is
  scheduled to run via TaskMan, sites should unschedule this job, as it is
  now obsolete.
   
  Issue 6:  Routine MPIFA24B was modified to prevent the logging of an
  exception when the Application Level Acknowledgment is sent back from
  the Master Patient Index as the MPI has already logged the exception.
   
  Issue 7: The fields prompted for review/verification during Load/Edit
  Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA], Register a Patient [DG REGISTER
  PATIENT] and Electronic 10-10EZ Processing [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING],
  now include ALIAS SSN when data is entered for the ALIAS field.  (ALIAS
  SSN is not required.)  Routine MPIFAPI has been modified to support
  this change.

  PLEASE NOTE:
  ============
  Routine VAFCSB will be released in a future patch - DG*5.3*707.
  Routine MPIFA31B references routine VAFCSB.  XINDEX may display:
  "Reference to routine '^VAFCSB'. That isn't in this UCI."
  The references to VAFCSB from within routine MPIFA31B contain conditional
  %ZOSF("TEST") checks for the existence of the routine and quit if it is
  not there.  So, the code is not dependent on DG*5.3*707 and will work
  with or without that patch being present.
