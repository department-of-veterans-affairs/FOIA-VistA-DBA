 Category:   ROUTINE
 
 Description:
 ============
 
 This patch is to address the changes to the Prosthetics system
 as outlined in IB*2.0*256.  The reason for the patch is to
 replace the current Prosthetics IB touchpoints with the 
 New API released by IB.  The affected option is the 
 Print Prosthetic Billings for MAS.
 
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
 
 This PROSTHETICS patch will provide a seamless transition
 for the PROSTHETICS program when a new authoritative
 source for Billing Data becomes available.  It modifies the
 PROSTHETICS application so that Insurance information
 pulled for the MAS report is done consistently.  There will
 be no changes to user functionality with the release of this patch.
 
 
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
 
 RMPRBIL
 
 Existing routine to print Prosthetics Billing for MAS report.  The following
 calls have been replaced with logic inside the program:
 
 	Q:$$INSURED^IBCNS1(DFN,RO)  	        linetag CK+4
 	D DISP^IBCNS				linetag WRI+3
 
 The rider information provided by these calls has been removed according to 
 the new IB API.  It has been verified that this information was not being used
 by MAS staff.
