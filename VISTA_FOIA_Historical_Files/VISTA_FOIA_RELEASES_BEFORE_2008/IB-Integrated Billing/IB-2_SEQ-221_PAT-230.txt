   NOIS OVERVIEW:
   ==============
   1. TNV-0901-32082     SECONDARY CARRIER BILLS
    
     Problem:
     -------
     When executing the IB Print Bill  [IB PRINT BILL]  the print review 
  BILL TOTAL amount was showing the amount due, reflecting the amount 
  previously paid (OFFSET). On the printed bill it showed all the charges 
  followed by the TOTAL CHARGES which reflected the offset amount, without
  listing the offset amount. In other words the TOTAL CHARGES field was
  showing the amount due not the total of the charges.
    
     Resolution:
     ----------
     The routine that calculates the TOTAL BILL on the print review was 
  changed to show the total amount of the bill not including the OFFSET.
  The same change was made for the routine that prints the bill, to print
  the total charges (the sum of all charges) not the amount due in the
  field labeled TOTAL CHARGE.
