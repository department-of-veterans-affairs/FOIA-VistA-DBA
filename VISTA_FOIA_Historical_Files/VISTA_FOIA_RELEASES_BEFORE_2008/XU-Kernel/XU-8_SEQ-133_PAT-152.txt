Description: 
============

 The New Person Name Standardization patch XU*8*134 introduced the Name
 Components file (#20) on which is defined a new-style MUMPS-type "ASIG"
 cross-reference. This "ASIG" cross-reference is designed to update the
 SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME field (#20.2) in the New Person file (#200)
 when any of the components parts of a person's name is edited.
  
 A bug in the cross-reference logic, however, prevented the SIGNATURE BLOCK
 PRINTED NAME field from being updated properly. New users added to the
 system after patch XU*8*134 was installed will have no value for their
 SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAMEs.
  
 This patch corrects the logic in the "ASIG" cross-reference. It also
 includes a Post-Install Routine XLFNP152 that loops through the entries in
 the New Person file, and if an entry has a null SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED
 NAME, updates the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME from the components stored
 in the corresponding entry in the Name Components file.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 This patch can be installed with VISTA users online. However, it is
 recommended that it be installed or queued for install during non-peak
 times.
  
 The only routine included in this patch is the Post-Install Routine
 XLFNP152. Since it is a new routine, mapping is not an issue.
  
  1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
      NOTE: Do NOT stop TaskMan and Do Not stp Background Filers.
  
  2.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
  3.  Under the 'Installation' menu, use the following option:
  
          Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
          Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*152
                               ==========
  
      Answer 'NO' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
      Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols?'
  
  4.  The Post-Install Routine XLFNP152 runs automatically. It loops
      through the entries in the New Person file and updates any SIGNATURE
      BLOCK PRINTED NAMEs that are null.
      
      NOTE: You can delete XLFNP152 after this patch is installed.
