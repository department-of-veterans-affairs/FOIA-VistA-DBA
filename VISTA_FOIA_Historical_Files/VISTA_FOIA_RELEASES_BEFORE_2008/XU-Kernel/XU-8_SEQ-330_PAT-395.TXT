 New supported API  $$HANDLE^XUSRB4("namespace"[,timetolive]), The call 
 returns the handle used to create a new record in the ^XTMP global with a 
 kill date out timetolive days, this defaults to 1 and has a limit of 7.
 The handle starts with the namespace parameter value. IA#4770
  
 HD: 127183
 Problem: If a user did not have a Phone number in the NPF, RDV
 would reject the request because it looks like there is a missing
 parameter.  The inclusion of the VPID makes the Phone not the last piece
 on the line.
 Fix: Check each parameter individually.
  
 The routines and checksums are listed in Routine Information section.
 New checksums can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD
 The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
