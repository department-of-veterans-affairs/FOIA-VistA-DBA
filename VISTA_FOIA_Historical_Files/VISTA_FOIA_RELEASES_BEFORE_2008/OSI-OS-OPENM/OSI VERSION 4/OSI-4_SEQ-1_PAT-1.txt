Subject: TEST ACCOUNT RESET UTILITIES V6.0

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 This patch announces the release of Enterprise Management Center's
 Test Account Reset Utilities version 6.0.  The way in which this software 
 is distributed and installed has changed.
  
 This software and the accompanying documentation can be retrieved from 
 the anonymous/testsystem directory at one of the following ftp servers:
  
         Hines           fo-hines.med.va.gov     10.3.29.201
         Salt Lake City  fo-slc.med.va.gov       10.5.21.65
         Albany          fo-albany.med.va.gov    10.1.19.5
  
 NOTE the change in directory path mentioned above.  Select an ftp server, 
 connect and then change directory to TESTSYSTEM.  The files all sites 
 would want to retrieve include:
  
         NVSTAR6.KID     <--this is a KIDs build containing a build
                            titled NVS*4*1 which further contains the full
                            Reset Utilities routine set.  Get this ascii.

         NVSTAR6_IG.DOC  <--this is a Word document containing the version

                            6 User Guide.  Get this binary.
  
 RELEASE NOTES
  
 The entire suite of routines is now distributed in a KIDs build.  This 
 change obviates the need for different save sets for the various M 
 engines in use in VA.  This KIDs build can be installed by any site on 
 any M platform.  Please refer to the Installation Guide (in document 
 NVSTAR6_IG.DOC) for detailed installation information.
  
 Test Account Reset Utilities
  
         Domain name synonyms are removed (deleted) when the domain name 
 in the Kernel Systems Parameters file is re-named.  This helps prevent 
 problems with incoming mail from the production system.
  
         The option to start up Task Manager at the completion of the 
 procedures has been removed.  There are several different platforms that 
 have different procedures for starting/restarting Task Manager.  The 
 Utilities no longer attempt to provide for these various startup 
 procedures.
  
         The NVSCIRN* routines are no longer distributed with the 
 Utilities.  This is because the core procedures provided in ^NVSCIRN1 and 
 ^NVSCIRN2 are incorporated into the basic NVSTAR procedures (note 
 additional information below.)
  
         Two additional HL7 clean up steps have been added.  It should be 
 noted that these new procedures significantly increase the time required 
 to complete a test account reset.
  
              In the HL7 MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION file (#773), a new
 procedure loops through and examines each entry for its STATUS (field
 #20).  If this field is not set to "SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED", the record is
 edited to reflect that status.  Further, the cross reference ^HLMA("AC")
 is deleted.
  
              A module previously documented to be run separately -
 DELMPI^NVSCIRN1 - is now incorporated into the basic procedures performed 
 by the Utilities.  This procedure examines all records in the Patient file
 (#2) for CIRN/MPI data.  If any are found, they are cleaned out.
  
         All entries in the ALERTS file (#8989) are deleted.  This 
 prevents potential user confusion with active alerts on the Test versus 
 production accounts.
  
         The Procedure Monitor (routine ^NVSTARM) has been removed.  The 
 output from the Utilities' procedures is now displayed directly to the 
 monitor.  This has been done primarily because of the HL7 clean up 
 additions noted above.  Those two procedures have significantly increased 
 the run time of the Utilities (see below).
  
         The amount of time required to run the Utilities to completion 
 has significantly increased. Previous versions usually completed in less 
 than 5 minutes regardless of platform (VMS/NT, DSM/Cache).  However, 
 depending upon the number of records in files 2, 773, and 8989, 
 completion may take as much as an hour or more.  Recent testing at a 
 Windows NT/Cache site with 61,000 patient records and approximately 
 140,000 HL7 messages required just over 20 minutes for completion of the 
 Utilities.  The Utilities simply do significantly more work than before 
 and as a result will require more time to complete.
  
 .       The modified XQ routines for use on test accounts are not 
 distributed in the NVSTAR KIDs build.  A separate set of files, 
 platform-specific, are provided at the ftp site.  These routines (XQ, 
 XQ12, XQ2 and XQTOC) are patched through XU*8.0*157.
  
 Data Scrambler and User Access Utilities
  
 Patient Data Scrambler Utility.
  
         Name and SSN scrambling algorithm has changed.  The first letter 
 of the patient's last name is no longer scrambled.
  
         The last 4 numbers of the patient's social security number are no 
 longer scrambled.  This, in conjunction with the change in name 
 scrambling mentioned above, provides for the retention of the "BS" and 
 "BS5" cross references (first letter last name+last 4 SSN) in the Patient 
 file.  This is a feature that was present in previous versions and many 
 sites have asked that it be reinstated.
  
 New Person/PAID Employee File Data Scrambler
  
        Various code changes have been made in response to bug reports.
  
        Update of the NAME COMPONENT file (#20) has been added so that 
 when NEW PERSON record names are scrambled, so too is the record in the 
 NAME COMPONENTS file.
  
 It is noted that some sites use this data scrambler, but there have been 
 others that have used it and been unhappy with the results.  It is 
 recommended that any potential users of this data scrambler read the 
 warning when the routine is executed.  If there are any questions about 
 what this scrambler will do, a support request should be submitted.
  
 Set the DISUSER Field in User Accounts
  
         This new and optional utility provides a means of setting the 
 DISUSER field (#7) in the New Person file for any or all user accounts 
 effectively terminating their access to the test system.  POSTMASTER's 
 account is excluded and will not be disabled.  Further, the user's 
 account in which the utility is running will also not be disabled.  The 
 user running the utility has the option of specifying user accounts that 
 should be excluded - that is, should NOT be disabled.  These accounts can 
 be either selected by individual user name, or by using the members in a 
 selected mail group (e.g., IRM).  If a mail group is selected, the local 
 members of that group will excluded from the DISUSER procedure.  The list 
 of excluded users can be further edited through another option provided.  
 Of course, FileMan can be used to reset the field for any user after this 
 utility has been run.
  
 Mail Message and Basket Purge Utility
  
         This optional utility that cleans out all mail messages and 
 purges all users' mail baskets has not been changed.
