Subject: CORRECTIONS TO THE VA CLASSIFICATION FIELD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  IMPORTANT
  This patch must be installed immediately after patch PSN*4*95 and PSN*4*97 
  are installed. All three patches should be installed at the same time and 
  in sequence.
  
  The names of several entries in the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605) have been
  changed.  Other entries in this file have been inactivated and replaced
  with new entries.  This patch makes corrections to several files in multiple
  applications that use the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605).
  
  
   The VA DRUG Class AM114 now has three entries.  Two of those entries, 
   AM114 - (INACTIVE) PENICILLINS and AM114 - (INACTIVE) BETA-LACTAM 
   ANTIMICROBIALS should not be selected.  The entry AM114 - PENICILLINS 
   AND BETA-LACTAM ANTIMICROBIALS is the active entry for AM114.
  
   The VA DRUG Class MS101 was changed to MS110 - SALICYLATES,ANTIRHEUMATIC
   In patch PSN*4*97.  This patch restores it back to MS101 - SALICYLATES,
   ANTIRHEUMATIC.
  
    The VA DRUG Class MS102 was changed to MS120 - NONSALICYLATE NSAIs,
   ANTIRHEUMATIC in patch PSN*4*97.  This patch restores it back to 
   MS102 - NONSALICYLATE NSAIs,ANTIRHEUMATIC.
  
  The patch will correct entries in the DRUG file (#50) so that the VA 
  CLASSIFICATION field (#2) matches the entry in the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS 
  field (#25).
  
 The patch also updates pointers in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) and
  the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) so that allergy relationships created prior
  to the NDF DATA Update PSN*4*95 continue to function correctly and display
  warnings appropriately.
  
  
  The patch updates the FH SITE PARAMETERS file (#119.9). Entries in the 
  DRUG CLASSIFICATIONS field (#85) will be updated so that they link to the 
  appropriate entry in the VA DRUG CLASS file (50.605) after installation of
  the NDF Data Update PSN*4*97.
  
  
  The patch updates the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#810.3), the REMINDER 
  TERM file (#811.5), and the REMINDER DEFINITION file (#811.9).  Changes in
  PSN*4*99 ensure that relationships created prior to installation of the NDF 
  Data Update Patch PSN*4*95 continue to function appropriately after 
  installation of the NDF Data Update patch PSN*4*97.
   
  This patch generates a mail message with the subject DRUG CLASS CHANGES
  from NDF MANAGER.  This message lists drugs for which the class was changed,
  the old class, and the new class.  This message is delivered to members
  of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the
  person installing the patch.
