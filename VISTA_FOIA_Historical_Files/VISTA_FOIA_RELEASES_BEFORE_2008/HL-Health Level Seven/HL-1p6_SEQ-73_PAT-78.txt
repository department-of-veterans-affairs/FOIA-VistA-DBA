Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*19   <<= must be installed BEFORE `HL*1.6*78'

Subject: Batch Trailer Segment has hard-coded field separator

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Test sites:    San Francisco VAMC, Bay Pines VAMC, Nashville VAMC
  
 NOIS:          ISH-0701-40476, Incorrect field separator in BTS segment
  
 Note:          This patch requires that KIDS build HL*1.6*19
                be installed.
  
 NOIS call ISH-0701-40476 reported the existence of the Circumflex 
 character (^) hard-coded as the field separator in the BTS segment when 
 creating HL7 batch messages. A mismatch in field separator characters 
 will occur in a message if a VistA application specifies a field 
 separator character other than the Circumflex.
  
 This patch removes the dependency on hard-coded field separator 
 characters in VistA HL7. This change will accommodate VistA applications 
 that use field separator characters other than the Circumflex, ensuring 
 that batch messages will have the same field separator character in all 
 their segments.

 Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  AXP/DSM SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
        routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options
        listed below:
  
          Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
          TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
        AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this
        installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
        MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following 'Installation'
        menu options in the order shown below:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
  
        When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
        the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
        questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
        shown below.
  
          INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*78>
          Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols?  <NO>
  
    6.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
        AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: If you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
        for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
    7.  AXP/DSM Sites:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
        map set, if necessary.
  
    8.  Start Link Manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
        START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
