Subject: REMOVE INACTIVE USER ALERT SCREEN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch removes a screen which prevents CPRS Notifications from 
 sending an alert to inactive users.  A problem arose when an alert was 
 triggered and no active users were identified, the alert was not sent.  
 The screening is now done in the Kernel Alerts utility.  In the case 
 where no active users have been identified to receive an alert, Kernel 
 Alerts insures an alert is sent.
  
 Note: This patch is related to patch XU*8*285 which addressed a patient 
 safety issue (PSI-03-040) dealing with critical clinical alerts that were
 not delivered because the recipients were inactive users.
