Description: 
============

   
   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   Please insure that the DSS Site Manager obtains a copy of this
   patch description.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
   Patch ECX*3*26 is being issued for sites who may install QUASAR v3
   before installation of the DSS FY2000 Update patch (ECX*3*24).
    
   File changes in QUASAR v3 necessitate this patch in order for DSS
   to obtain volume data for procedures associated with the QUASAR 
   record.
   
   All DSS sites extracting FY1999 data should install this patch 
   immediately, whether or not an installation of QUASAR v3 is planned.

   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*26):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*26.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
