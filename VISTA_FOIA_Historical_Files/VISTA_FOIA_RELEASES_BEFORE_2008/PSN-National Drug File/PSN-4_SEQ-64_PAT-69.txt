Subject: CREATE NEW FIELD IN VA PRODUCT FOR EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTIONS

Category: 
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  1.  This patch installs the EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTION CK field (#23)
  in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).  This set of codes field will be used
  in pharmacy order checking to bypass drug-drug interaction checking on
  specific VA Products IN THE FUTURE.  This patch does not populate the
  new field.
  
  2.  Under certain circumstances if an entry in the VA PRODUCT file
  (#50.68) was unmarked for CMOP, entries in the DRUG file (#50) matched
  to that item were not unmarked.  The post-install routine for this
  patch, PSN4P69P, corrects that problem.  The post-install routine
  creates a mail message from NDF MANAGER with the subject DRUGS UNMARKED
  FOR CMOP that lists the items that were unmarked.  That message is sent
  to the mail group NDF DATA, holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the
  person installing the patch.
