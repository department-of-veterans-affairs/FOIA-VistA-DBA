Subject: HEALTH SUMMARY GAF COMPONENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the routine which is invoked for the AD HOC HEALTH 
 SUMMARY component, the Global Access Function to report GAF scores 
 graphically, so that a report generated on the last day of the month will 
 produce a valid listing rather than showing "No data available".

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD0000000067730    IND-0903-42431  GAF not working in Health summary
  
    Problem:
    --------
    As Reported
    +++++++++++
    User could not get a GAF report when running the report on the
    last day of the month, using the AD HOC HEALTH SUMMARY component
    for a patient that he knew recently had a GAF score.
  
    As Analyzed
    +++++++++++
    When running the Global Access Function AD HOC HEALTH SUMMARY
    component at the end of the month, the routine GMTSGAF performs
    erroneous date algorithms thereby failing to generate any listing.
    Not seeing any events the report displays "No data available".
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The routine date algorithm was modified to produce a listing, when the
    report is run on the end of the month.

 Installation should take less than 1 minute.
    
      1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
          load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
      2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines in the Routine
          Summary are mapped, then they should be removed from the 
          mapped set at this time.
      3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
          select the Installation menu.
      4.  From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following
          options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMTS*2.7*74):
            a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            b.  Print Transport Global
            c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
            d.  Backup a Transport Global
      5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select package GMTS*2.7*74.
      6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
