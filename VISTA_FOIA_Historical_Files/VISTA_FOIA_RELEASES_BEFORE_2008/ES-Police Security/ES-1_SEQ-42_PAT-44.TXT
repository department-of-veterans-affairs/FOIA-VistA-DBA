 2. HD127250   Conflict between Category and Status under complainant
               portion of Offense Report
 Problem:
 --------
 Conflict between category and status under complainant portion 
 of offense report. When inputting offense report, template takes 
 user under complainant portion to .02 branching to 910's category  
 (which is ok but O=outsider) when outputting the same information, 
 the output data is from 912's status field under complainant which 
 is a conflict (since 0=other here)
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In ESP MASTER NAME INDEX (#910) file modify CATEGORY (#.04) field 
 help prompt and description.  In ESP OFFENSE REPORT (#912) file modify
 STATUS (#.03) subfield of DATE/TIME OF OFFENSE (#.03) field values.
