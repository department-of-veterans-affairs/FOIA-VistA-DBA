Subject: P-MESSAGE DEVICE PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch corrects patch XM*8*26 which was entered in error and was 
 trying to fix patch XM*8*28.
  
 Here is the description for patch XM*8*28:
  
 [When users schedule an option, and queue the output to the P-MESSAGE 
 device, P-MESSAGE will prompt them within the Screen Manager, and the 
 process becomes difficult for the users to decipher.  This also gives 
 the users problems with exiting the prompt that asks for the device.
 This patch also corrects a problem caused by the OPEN EXECUTE
 statement in the P-MESSAGE terminal type created by patch OSI*4*3. 
 After this patch is installed, the P-MESSAGE device will generate an
 undefined error when the user selects a non-existent recipient  to
 receive the report.]
  
 Here is the description for patch XM*8*26:
  
 [If you select queueing when printing to P-MESSAGE, and then up-arrow out
 any time during the question and answer session, you are asked:
  
 "Previously, you have selected queueing.
 Do you STILL want your output QUEUED? YES//"
  
 It can get confusing from there, and even go into a loop, depending on 
 how you answer.  This patch fixes the problem.]
  
 Patch XM*8*33 fixes patch XM*8*28 by quitting the routine if 
 called by Screenman.

 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ------------------
 HD0000000063683 - (MAC-1203-61191)  P-MESSAGE Device sporadic malfunction
  
    Problem
    -------
    While in Screenman, printing to a queued p-message device will skip 
    over the 'Subject:' prompt. The fix was done (XM*8*26) by killing the
    XMQUIET variable in the XMAPHOST routine which was not the appropriate 
    thing to do.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    If the XMAPHOST routine is invoked from Screenman, it just quits.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the Mailman package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XM*8.0*33):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XM*8.0*33.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted, Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO// respond No.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
