Subject: PROSTHETICS NOT DISPLAYING MORE THAN 15 COMPONENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the problem in the display when entering 
 data in field defined as multiples in the Operation [SROMEN-OP]
 Option. The display is limited to 15 entries, and there are 
 times when it is necessary to enter more than 15.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1) SDC-0604-60335     Prosthetics not displaying on Operation Menu
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The nurse has entered in multiple prosthetics for a patient.  They list 
 on the Nurse Intra-Op Report.  However, when the nurse goes back in to 
 edit information for the prosthesis in question, none show up.  The 
 nurse also pulled up another patient that has had a prosthesis item 
 entered and it does show up.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine SRCUSS0 so that when entering data in fields defined as
 multiple, the program will allow more then 15 entries.  It will also 
 display the first 16 entries of the multiple field and prompt the 
 user to select the item they would like to edit or press return to see
 the next 16 entries if applicable. This change will affect ALL fields
 that are defined as a multiple.
