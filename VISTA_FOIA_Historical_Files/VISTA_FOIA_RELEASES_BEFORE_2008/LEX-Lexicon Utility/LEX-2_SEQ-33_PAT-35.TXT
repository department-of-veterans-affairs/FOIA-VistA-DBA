  FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
   
    The KIDs builds is being distributed in a Packman Message from the
    National Patch Module (NPM).
             
    Data for this patch is being distributed in a global host file:
  
        Filename         FTP Protocol
        ------------     ------------
        LEX_2_35.GBL     ASCII
    
    The preferred method is to FTP this file from download.vista.med.va.gov
    which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
   
    This file may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations.
    
        Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
    The file is available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
   
      1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*35.
          It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
          hours.  This patch should take less than 10 minutes to install.
    
      2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
     
                CPT/HCPCS Procedure           #81            ^ICPT(
                CPT/HCPCS Modifier            #81.3          ^DIC(81.3,
                Lexicon Files                 #747-757.41    ^LEX(
 
      3)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
          not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you 
          will need to kill this global before proceeding.
     
          On a Cache system, the prevention of unsubscripted global kills
          is a system wide setting, but can be allowed for a particular 
          process using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling 
          unsubscripted global kills is:
     
                  VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                  VAH>K ^LEXM
     
          The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
          is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and
          creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
     
      4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_35.GBL.  This 
          file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
 
             Cache 3.2/4.1 - Thin Client Global Restore
  
                  Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache 
                  cube, then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces" 
                  folder, then open the "VAH" folder, and right click on 
                  the "Globals" folder. Select the "Import from disk" 
                  option. Click on the "Options..." button.  Select the 
                  "Globals" tab, make sure the format is VAX DSM, then 
                  click "OK." Find the file in the directory, double click
                  on LEX_2_35.GBL.  Next, select "Import All."  At the 
                  prompt "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select "Yes."
  
             Cache 3.2/4.1 - Programmer Mode
  
                  From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
  
                    >D ^%GI
  
                     Global input
  
                     Device: va#$:[directory]LEX_2_35.GBL;1   Parameters: "RS"=>
                     Globals were saved on DD MMM YYYY HH:MM PA  Cache
                     with description: Description
  
                     Input option: A
                     ^LEXM
  
          The loading of the global should take from 1 to 2 minutes.
   
      5)  Turn journaling off for globals ^ICPT, ^LEX and ^LEXC.
     
            Cache v3.2  - Journaling OFF
  
              Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache cube,
              then select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local Databases" 
              folder, then open the folder where the ^LEX* globals reside. 
              Right click ^LEX, select "Properties," and uncheck the 
              "Journal global" box.  Repeat for ^LEXC and ^ICPT globals.
  
            Cache v4.1 - Journaling OFF
  
               Journaling on a Cache system running version 4.1 of 
               Cache cannot be disabled by individual global.  Journaling
               CAN BE disabled for a user's current process.  In this case,
               the process will be the installation of this patch.  It is
               important to know that for this to work, the KIDS 
               installation CANNOT be tasked off.  The installation MUST
               be run on your screen for the disabled journaling to be 
               in effect. 
  
               To determine if your process has journaling enabled, you 
               can call:
  
                 >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                     0 means journaling is disabled, 
                     1 means it's on
  
               To disable journaling for the current process:
  
                  >D DISABLE^%NOJRN
  
               Double check your process to be sure journaling is 
               disabled:
  
                 >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                     0 means journaling is disabled, 
                     1 means it's on
   
               Proceed with the installation remembering NOT to task off
               the install.
  
      6)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
    
      7)  Distribution Load:
    
          Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
          Packman function "Install/Check Message."
   
             Environment Check:  
    
               Only package components and system variables will be checked
               during the loading of the transport global.
  
      8)  KIDS Installation:
    
          Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action 
          "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*35.  The KIDS
          installation should take less than five minutes (with 
          journaling off) depending on the number of users/jobs on the
          system.
    
            Environment Check:  
     
              LEX*2.0*35 data exists (by global translation):
   
                If the data for LEX*2.0*35 has been installed and is
                translated into the current account, then only package 
                components and system variables will be checked.
  
              LEX*2.0*35 data does not exist:
 
                If the data for LEX*2.0*35 cannot be found (either in 
                the current account or by translation), then the environment
                check routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build
                namespace and global checksum.  This is to ensure that the
                correct import global is loaded and that all of the data 
                contained in the import global arrived at your site during
                the FTP transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the 
                wrong import global or the global fails the checksum, the
                install will stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP
                another copy of the import global (see the section on FTP
                Software Retrieval and steps 3 and 4 of the Installation 
                Instructions).
              
          Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//" prompt.
      
          Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu 
          Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
    
      9)  Cleanup
    
          a)  Check that the export global ^LEXM has been killed 
              automatically. 
     
              If it has not been automatically killed, you will need to 
              kill the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent 
              import global checksum errors on future installations.
     
              On a Cache system, the prevention of unsubscripted global 
              kills is a system wide setting, but can be allowed for a 
              particular process using the $ZU command.  The command for
              enabling unsubscripted global kills is:
     
                  VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                  VAH>K ^LEXM
     
              The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
              is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process
              and creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
  
          b)  If journaling was turned off prior to installation, then
              the journaling must be turned back on when the installation
              is complete.
     
                Cache v3.2  - Journaling ON
  
                    Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache
                    cube, then select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local 
                    Databases" folder, then open the folder where the 
                    ^LEX* globals reside.  Right click ^LEX, select 
                    "Properties," and check the "Journal global" box.
                    Repeat for ^LEXC and ^ICPT globals.
  
                Cache v4.1 - Journaling ON
  
                    Journaling on a Cache system running version 4.1 of 
                    Cache can only be turned back on for the user's 
                    current process.
   
                    When the installation of this patch has completed
                    (interactively - not tasked), you may enable journaling
                    for the current process.
  
                    To determine if your process has journaling disabled, 
                    you can call:
  
                        >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                      0 means journaling is disabled, 
                      1 means it's on
  
                    To enable journaling for the current process:
  
                        >D ENABLE^%NOJRN
       
                    Double check your process to be sure journaling is 
                    enabled:
  
                        >W $$CURRENT^%NOJRN()
  
                      0 means journaling is disabled, 
                      1 means it's on
   
          c)  If routines LEX2035 and LEX2035P are found on your system, 
              they may be deleted upon completion of the installation. 
              These routines are the environment check and post-install
              routines for this installation.
