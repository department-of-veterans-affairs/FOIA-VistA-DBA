Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*109  <<= must be installed BEFORE `HL*1.6*123'

Subject: Link Manager and TaskMan

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the behavior of the TCP Link Manager when starting 
 client logical links.
  
 Currently, the link manager checks the granting of a previous task
 requests to start a client logical link.  If the task hasn't started in 30
 minutes, then the link will be removed from Tasman's request queue, an 
 alert is sent to the designated mailman group, and the status of the link
 is set to Shutdown.  The link manager won't re-attempt to start this 
 link until the link is manually "re-enabled" using the HL7 options.
  
 This patch allows the task request to remain in TaskMan's request queue 
 without being removed if the task is active (the task status is checked).
 Only when a task for the link is inactive or undefined will initiate the
 new request of task from TaskMan.
 In addition, the link won't be shutdown, so no alert will be sent.
 Moreover, the status of the link is set to "Tasked" to indicate that a
 new task has been requested.
  
 Remedy:
 =======
 HD0000000064030: VMS-CACHE Taskman stops HL7 links nightly.
 HD0000000088408: The BCMA Contingency links are being shutdown.

 Installation Instructions (takes fewer than 10 minutes):
 =========================
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
   2.  VMS SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
       routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
       should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3.  Shutdown only the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management
       option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
       system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
       global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
       MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following 'Installation'
       menu options in the order shown below:
  
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         Install Package(s)
  
       When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
       the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
       questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
       shown below.
  
         INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*123>
         Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
         Protocols?  <NO>
  
   6.  VMS Sites Only:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
       map set, if necessary.
  
   7.  Restart the Link Manager, that was shutdown in step 3, using the
       Filer and Link Management option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
