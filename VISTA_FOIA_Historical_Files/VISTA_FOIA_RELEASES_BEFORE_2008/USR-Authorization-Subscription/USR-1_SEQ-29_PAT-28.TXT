 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000114736 - Problem adding business rules by user class
  
    Problem:
    --------
    TIU OBJECTS and/or TIU TITLES are displaying as
    defaults when the (A)dd selection is chosen using Roll/Scroll
    in the Business Rules by User Class when nothing should be
    in the default selection.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Removed the call to the "B" reference file in routine USRRULA 
    line tag DOCPICK that was making a call to DIC("B") variable 
    in FileMan and passing it as a matching IEN in the TIU DOCUMENT 
    DEFINITION file (#8925.1). This is not correct and not needed.
    The default Document Definition not related to the User class 
    will no longer automatically default.
  
 2. HD0000000067520 - PTH-0902-21083  List Membership by Class/User 
                         show different info
  
  
  ISSUE 1
  
    Problem:
    --------
    List Membership by User [USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY USER] option
    displays information from oldest entry to the newest for each Class
    a user is a member of.  If the multiple class membership entries
    are not entered in sequential order according to the effective/expire
    dates, the display can end up appearing out of order.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Corrected the display for Listing Membership by User [USR LIST
    MEMBERSHIP BY USER] option to display active effective/expire dates
    first, followed by the other entries sorted by effective date to
    display from most recent/future dates to the oldest.
  
  ISSUE 2
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The List Membership by Class [USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS] option
    was displaying what appeared to be Expired Members.  This is due to 
    the effective/expire date being displayed from the first entry
    for a user for a specific class.  The problem is that more than
    one entry for the class is available, and the first entry may not
    be the effective/expire date that is active for the user.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Corrected the List Membership by Class [USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS]
    option to display an active effective/expire date combination for the
    Members in a User Class.
