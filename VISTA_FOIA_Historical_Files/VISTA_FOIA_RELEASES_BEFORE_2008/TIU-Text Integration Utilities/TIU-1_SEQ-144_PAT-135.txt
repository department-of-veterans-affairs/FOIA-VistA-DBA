Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 This patch provides the user with a simplified method to create TIU "Health 
 Summary" Objects specifically designed for the display of a Health Summary 
 Report (patch GMTS*2.7*58 provides new display customizations for these 
 reports).
  
    General Information for TIU Objects
    -----------------------------------
      -TIU objects must have a unique NAME, PRINT NAME, & ABBREVIATION.
      -Status must be set ACTIVE to use.
      -By default, during object creation, the NAME and PRINT NAME are the 
       same.
      -An Object's Method determines behavior.
      -Objects should only be activated/inactivated or modified by their owner.
      -Modifications to the Technical Fields/Object Method should be done
       with extreme care and may render an object "broken".
  
  
 Detailed Description:
 ====================
 This patch provides the user with the ability to easily create and edit 
 specialized TIU objects designed to display customized Health Summary 
 Reports* through the use of "Health Summary Objects".
 
 * Warning - if the Health Summary Report selected for use with the TIU 
   Object does not contain any components, using the TIU Object will cause the 
   GUI to hang; this is being addressed in Health Summary Patch GMTS*2.7*63.
 
 The Object Method is pre-generated and populated with the appropriate Mumps 
 code to display the desired report using "Health Summary Objects".
  
 While all TIU objects may be viewed through the standard Document 
 Definitions Manager, this patch utilizes the List Manager and conveniently 
 sorts and displays only the TIU objects created by this patch.
  
 By design, the TIU Health Summary Object utility provides only a limited 
 ability to edit an object's characteristics -- existing TIU functionality 
 was not to be duplicated.  The new Health Summary Display parameters can be 
 set and edited through this patch.
  
 Complete manipulation of these and all TIU objects is available through 
 the standard TIU Document Definitions (Manager) Menu.  Any changes made to 
 a TIU object should be done with care and may "break" an object.
