 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1.  HD69047 - Orphaned .1 nodes in ^LR
  
 2.  HD70130 - Routine LRBLPOST does not exist
 Duplicate:    HD116674 - Missing routine ^LRBLPOST
  
  
 Testing Sites:
 =============
 Cincinnati VAMC
 New Orleans VAMC
 Montana HCS
  
  
 Problem (1):  HD69047
 ===========
 This problem arises because of a change that was made to a micro edit
 template some time ago. This change included the WARD field (.08) from
 the 63.05 multiple. During micro results entry, a response to the WARD
 prompt that is a non-standard location will be set at ^LR(DFN,.1) rather
 than being set correctly at ^LR(LRDFN,.1).
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Modify the DD (^DD(63.05,.08)) to make the correct global set.
  
  
 Problem (2):  HD70130  HD116674
 ===========
 The menu option FILE 81 CONVERSION is obsolete.  The routine for this
 option, LRBLPOST, was removed in patch LR*5.2*247.  However, the menu
 option remains and should be removed.
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Remove the obsolete menu option.
