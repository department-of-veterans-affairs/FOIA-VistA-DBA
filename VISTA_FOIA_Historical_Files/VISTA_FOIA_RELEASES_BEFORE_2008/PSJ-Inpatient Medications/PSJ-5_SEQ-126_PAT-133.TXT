Subject: ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  * WARNING - Prior to installing this patch, please check for local Class
  III modifications that may be overwritten upon installation. Failure to 
  reinstall Class III modifications after installation of this patch may 
  prevent the Class III changes from functioning properly. 
  
  1. A site reported an error that occurred during Speed Finish of pending
  renewal orders. The error occurred after an unsuccessful lock of the
  original renewed order. This patch will prevent this error by ensuring a
  graceful exit when a lock is not successful. CLE-1204-41459
  
  2. The administration schedule validation process causes an error if a
  day-of-week PRN schedule is used that contains days that are out of
  order, for example, "WE-MO PRN". This patch will prevent this error and
  make the validation of this type of schedule consistent with non-PRN
  day-of-week schedules. PUG-1204-51601.
  
  3. An undefined error may occur when viewing a pending IV renewal order
  from the Medications Tab in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 
  1.0. This patch will correct the problem by preventing the error from 
  occurring. MIN-1204-41611.
  
  4. When renewing an Inpatient IV order from the Inpatient Order Entry
  [PSJ OE] option, an edit to the Provider is not reflected in the order 
  when viewed from CPRS V.1.0. This patch will correct the problem by 
  ensuring the updated provider information is transmitted to CPRS V.1.0.
  IND-0105-40153
  
  5. There is no prompt for output device for the PRE-EXCHANGE UNITS REPORT
  after copying a Unit Dose order using the CO Copy action in Inpatient 
  Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. This patch will add a device prompt for the 
  PRE-EXCHANGE UNITS REPORT to the Unit Dose copy action. HWH-1204-41654
  
  6. When finishing a pending unit dose renewal order, the default
  administration times associated with the administration schedule will
  always default into the order, overwriting the order's existing
  administration time. With this patch, renewal orders will retain the
  original order's administration times. BHS-0105-10562
  
  7. When the schedule type is edited during the finish of a unit dose
  order that was renewed from CPRS V.1.0, the order appears twice in the
  PAtient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU PR] option, and continuous to appear 
  on the pick list and the medication administration record (MAR) after the
  order expires. This patch corrects the problem by removing the display
  associated with the previous schedule type before adding the display
  associated with the new schedule type. FRE-0105-60387, MAC-0205-61020,
  UNY-0205-11038, HD0000000068862.
  
  8. Multiple identically named schedules in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE 
  file (#51.1) may cause an invalid schedule warning message to appear 
  inappropriately. This patch corrects the problem by preventing the 
  invalid warning message from appearing if the schedule name is defined in
  the file, even if duplicates are present. HD0000000085881.
  
  9. A non-standard Day of Week schedule entered without administration
  times using the schedule builder in CPRS V. 3.0 may default to a 
  different schedule in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 if the non-standard 
  schedule is a partial match to a unique Day of Week schedule in the
  ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). For example, if the non-standard 
  schedule SU-MO-TU-WE is entered without admin times using the CPRS V.
  3.0 schedule builder, and the schedule SU-MO-TU-WE-TH@09 exists in the
  ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and there are no other schedules in
  the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) that begin with SU-MO-TU-WE, the
  order's schedule will default to SU-MO-TU-WE-TH@09 when the order is
  selected for finishing. HD0000000087120 PSI-05-025.
  
  10. A non-standard Day of Week schedule entered using the schedule 
  builder in CPRS V. 3.0 defaults to the wrong Expected First Dose if the 
  schedule is a partial match to exactly one schedule in the ADMINISTRATION
  SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and that schedule that was found contains an
  administration time. HD0000000087028 PSI-05-026.
