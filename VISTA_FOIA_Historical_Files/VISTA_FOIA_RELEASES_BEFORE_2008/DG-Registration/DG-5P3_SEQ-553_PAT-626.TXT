Subject: COMBAT OVERLAP FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  1. Based on a business decision by the Central Business office, the
     Combat and Conflict fields on Registration screen 6 should not allow
     overlapping dates to be entered.  Although the HVE Phase II patch
     prevented the entry of an overlapping conflict when it overlapped with
     an already defined period of Combat, it did not prevent users from
     entering the Conflict information first, and then entering the
     overlapping period of Combat.
  
     This patch will resolve this issue, by checking for overlapping date
     ranges on the Combat fields, as well as the Conflict fields.
  
  2. Another reported issue had to do with Conflict From and To Dates not being
     checked appropriately. This issue allows a user to enter a To date before
     a From Date, and/or disallows the entry of a valid date when the software
     thought it was outside the range of the conflict.  This issue is being
     resolved with this patch.
  
  3. The third issue being resolved with this patch, involves the Combat
     Location field.  If a user enters information for one patient using the
     combat fields, and then immediately edits data on another patient's combat
     from/to dates (without entering a new Combat Location), then the previous
     patient's combat location is used to determine the appropriate date range
     for the combat period.  This issue has been resolved with a modification
     to the ^DGRPE and ^DGRPCE routines.
  
  4. The fourth is based on a business decision by the Central Business Office
     that the Combat From and To fields can now equal  (i.e., be the same
     date). In addition, the Conflict To date may be equivalent to the Combat
     From date or another Conflict From date without causing an inconsistency.
  
  5. Sites that did not clean up the combat and/or conflict dates to reflect
     at a minimum of a month and a year were unable to update the imprecise
     "year-only" date. This fifth issue is being resolved by allowing a user
     to change an imprecise date to a more precise date of either a month/year
     or day/month/year.
