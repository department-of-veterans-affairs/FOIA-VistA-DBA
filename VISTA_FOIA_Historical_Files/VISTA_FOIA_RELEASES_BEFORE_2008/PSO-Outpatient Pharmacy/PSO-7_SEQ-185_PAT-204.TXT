Description:
============

  1. The My HealtheVet (MHV) team, in preparation for the My HealtheVet V.
     1.0 package (Internet Prescription Refill project), requested an
     additional Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Application Program Interface
     (API) #4687 to provide details of all (active, verified, on hold,
     suspended, discontinued, pending and expired), prescriptions within a
     given date for a patient.
  
  2. Also, the existing API #3768 has been modified to provide the
     following status for Internet refill requests (used internally):
  
     Calling AP1 component will return the following status:
  
    -5      DFN does not match RX
    -4      Unable to resolve patient
    -3      Unable to resolve prescription
    -2      Status is pending
    -1      Result is back but not picked up
     0      Other error
     1      Filed in PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
  
     Calling AP2 component will return the following status:
  
     -6     RX not in file #52.43
     -5     DFN does not match RX
     -4     Unable to resolve patient
     -3     Unable to resolve prescription
     -2     Status is pending
     -1     Result is back but not picked up
      1     Filled
      2     Not Filled
      n^x   n - Date the refill request was processed.
            x - The result of the processing. This will be either FILLED or
                NOT FILLED. 
  
      Calling AP5 component will return the following status: 
    
      -6     RX not in file #52.43
      -4     Unable to resolve patient
      -3     Unable to resolve prescription
      -2     Status is pending
       0     The update was not successful. This will occur if any of the
             information provided (DFN, RX #) are invalid.
       1     The update was successful.
  
  3. A new PATIENT field (#9) was added to the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST
     file (#52.43) that is a pointer to the PATIENT file (#2).  A new 
     "AC" cross reference was added to index the file by PATIENT field 
     (#9) and PRESCRIPTION IEN field (#8). The existing "AA", and "AB"
     cross references were removed.
  
  Note: This patch carries a Pre-install routine that will delete the
  Data Dictionary (DD) of the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
  before the install of the new DD. This file is not in use currently;
  however, it will not destroy any data in the test systems.
  
  No options are released with this version. However, the previously 
  released Process Internet Refills [PSO INTERNET REFILLS] option is
  updated. You will need to begin using this option on a regular basis to
  process the refill requests entered by users of MHV. The recommendation
  is to run the option at least three times a day.
  
  For more details, please refer to the installation guide or the technical
  manual of the My HealtheVet V. 1.0 package.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be installed with Outpatient Pharmacy users on the system,
  but they should not be using the Process Internet Refills [PSO INTERNET 
  REFILLS] option. Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
      Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*204):
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*204.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
