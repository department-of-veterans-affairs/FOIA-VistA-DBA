Subject: CROSS-REFERENCES FOR OEF/OIF

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch adds four new cross-references that result in two new indexes
 to the PATIENT file (#2). These indexes are used for Operation Enduring
 Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) reporting.
  
 Three of the cross-references are new-style compound cross-references on
 the SERVICE ENTRY DATE and SERVICE SEPARATION DATE. They are
 cross-references because there are three sets of these dates: LAST, NTL,
 and NNTL. The cross-references are named ASERLAST, ASERNTL, and ASERNNTL;
 the associated field numbers are shown in the following table:
  
 Cross-reference  Field numbers
 -----------------------------
 ASERLAST        .326  .327
 ASERNTL         .3292 .3293
 ASERNNTL        .3297 .3298
  
 These three cross-references create one index that has the form
 ^DPT("ASERVICE",SERVICE SEPARATION DATE,SERVICE ENTRY DATE,DA,TYPE), where
 TYPE has the value "LAST", "NTL", or "NNTL", as appropriate.
  
 The fourth cross-reference, named APTYPE, is on the TYPE field (#391) and
 it has the form ^DPT("APTYPE",TYPE,DA).
  
 The new routine DGSRVICE has a utility that will verify that the indexes
 are in synch with the data in the PATIENT file.  It does this by checking
 all the entries in the PATIENT file to make sure they are indexed 
 properly, and then checks all the entries in the indexes to make sure they
 match what is in the PATIENT file.  Detailed information is in the 
 Installation section of this patch narrative.

 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system; however, since it
 populates the new indexes, install it during off hours. The 
 installation time depends on the number of entries in the Patient 
 file (#2). At a medium sized site with approximately 154,000
 entries, installation took about 12 minutes.
  
 1. On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.
  
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (DG*5.3*690)
  
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
    respond 'NO'.
  
 5. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'NO'.
  
 6. After installation is complete, run a utility to verify that all
    PATIENT file entries are indexed and all entries in the indexes
    match the data in the PATIENT file:
   
    D VERIFY^DGSRVICE 
  
    This verification took approximately 20 minutes to run at a site 
    with about 154,000 entries in the PATIENT file.
  
 7. Once the installation has successfully completed, you may delete the
    init routine DG53690I.
