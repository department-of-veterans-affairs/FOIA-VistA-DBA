  PROJECT OVERVIEW:
  =================
  Post implementation functional issues with automatic address updating
  introduced with GMT phase I have occurred and made it desirable to implement
  a bad address indicator.  This functionality is designed to help prevent the
  spread and corruption of VISTA databases with addresses that are known to be
  invalid or incorrect.  It addresses several NOIS messages and an inquiry
  raised by the Patient Safety committee.
  
  The project addresses the following issues and requirements:
  
  1. Known bad addresses must be identified and flagged so that they are
     prevented from updating the HEC or other VISTA databases.  This process
     is to be performed manually by updating the Bad Address Indicator on
     known bad addresses.
  
  2. Veterans with the Bad Address Indicator set, must not be mailed
     Means Test Renewal letters.  Patients fitting this criteria will be
     identified in a bulletin transmitted to the EAS MT LETTERS mailgroup.
  
  3. The veteran's permanent address associated with the Bad Address
     Indicator will NOT be shared with the HEC.
  
  4. There have been several NOIS issues reported related to the auto
     population of city, state, and county name based on entry of a zip code.
     City information will now be provided on a regular basis to ensure
     population of a city name with postal codes know to be valid.
     This functionality is being provided by Kernel patch XU*8*292, which will
     be released at a future date.
  
  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
  =======================
  The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
  
  1. Modifications have been made to display the Bad Address Indicator in the
     EAS VIEW PATIENT ADDRESS functionality.
 
  2. Veterans with the Bad Address Indicator set, must not be mailed
     Means Test Renewal letters.  Patients fitting this criteria will be
     identified in a bulletin transmitted to the EAS MTLETTERS mailgroup.
     Software changes to support this requirement have been made in this patch.
