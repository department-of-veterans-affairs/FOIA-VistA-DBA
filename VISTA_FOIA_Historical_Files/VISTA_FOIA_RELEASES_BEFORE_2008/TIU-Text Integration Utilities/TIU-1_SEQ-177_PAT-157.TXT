Description:
============

 This patch deals with issues related to the TIU additional signature 
 functionality.  There are multiple issues addressed here.  
 
 This patch is related to Patient Safety Issue PSI-04-036.  This patch does 
 not address the Patient Safety Issue directly.  The issue there will be 
 resolved by a future Kernel patch that will forward alerts back to the 
 original recipient when a surrogacy period ends.
 
 The following sections detail each change.
  
 TIU NIGHTLY TASK CHANGES
 ========================
 First a change was made to the TIU NIGHTLY TASK to allow sites to 
 regenerate overdue unsigned additional signature alerts.  This was previously 
 not included in the nightly task.  The following two new TIU PARAMETERS 
 control this:
  
   START OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD
   END OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD
  
 The parameters control the time period that the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will 
 search for overdue additional signatures.  The parameters are installed in 
 a manner that caused the TIU NIGHTLY TASK to perform exactly the same way 
 as the pre-patch nightly task. 
  
 Both of these parameters must be in a Fileman Date Range format.  Examples 
 of valid inputs would be 6D for 6 days, 2W for 2 weeks and 3M for 3 months. 
 If no value is entered for START OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD then the nightly 
 task will NOT regenerate alerts based on overdue additional signatures.  If 
 no value is entered for END OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD then the nightly task
 will stop searching for overdue additional signatures with notes created on 
 the day before the current day.
  
 An example of setting the two parameters would be as follows:
  
 START OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD: 3M
 END OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD: 2M
  
 These settings would cause the nightly task to begin searching for overdue 
 additional signatures 3 months prior to the current date and stop searching 
 2 months prior to the current date.  The TIU Document's ENTRY DATE/TIME is 
 the date/time that is used to evaluate each document. These parameters can 
 be edited under the option [TIU BASIC PARAMETER EDIT].
  
 REPORT CHANGES
 ==============
 This patch also modifies reporting functionality to allow tracking of 
 unsigned additional signatures. A new option was added [TIU REVIEW UNSIGNED 
 ADDSIG] to both the Progress Notes User Menu [TIU MAIN MAIN MENU PN 
 CLINICIAN] and the Integrated Document Management Menu [TIU MAIN MENU MIXED 
 CLINICIAN].  This new option functions like the ALL MY UNSIGNED Documents, 
 but only retrieves documents that the user is required to sign as an 
 additionally identified signer.  
  
 A new report was added to the TIU MRT Menu [TIU MAIN MENU MRT].  The new 
 option for this report is "Review unsigned additional signatures" [TIU 
 REVIEW MRT ADD SGNR].  This report gives the user a list of documents 
 that require additional signatures. This report has a detailed view to see 
 each individual document and a summary view to see totals for Services and 
 Divisions.  The new AC index on the TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE file is used to 
 facilitate speedy generation of this new report.
  
 SURROGATES SIGNING
 ==================
 Finally, this patch adds the functionality to allow an identified surrogate 
 for alerts to additionally sign for the user that he/she is a surrogate for. 
 This will be controlled by ASU (Authorized Subscription Utility) business 
 rules and can be set on a per Title basis.  In order to allow this for a 
 particular Title, sites will need to add the following business rule to
 that Document Title in ASU:
  
   A COMPLETED (TITLE) "Any_Title" may BE SIGNED by a SURROGATE
 
 This rule can be added at any level in the TIU Document Definitions 
 Hierarchy.  Thus sites may wish to add it to the PROGRESS NOTES Document 
 Class so that Surrogates could sign on all Progress Notes.
 
 DOCUMENTATION
 =============
 Please refer to the TIU Technical Manual and TIU User Manual for changes 
 related to the issues in this patch.  Both manuals can be found in both 
 PDF and Word formats on the web at the following address:
        http://www.va.gov/vdl/Clinical.asp?appID=65
 
 Sites may also elect to retrieve documents directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY

    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
 
 Username is "anonymous" without the quotes.  Just hit enter at the password 
 prompt.  You must ftp in BINARY mode.  Once into the ftp server change 
 directory into the software directory (ie:  cd software)  The names of the

 Installation Instructions: 
 =========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.
 Installation of this patch will vary depending upon the size of the TIU 
 MULTIPLE SIGNATURE file due to the new index creation.
       
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
        
      2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in this 
         patch are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at 
         this time.  
       
      3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
         select the Installation menu.  
       
      4. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
         options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*157): 
       
         a.  Backup a Transport Global 
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
      
      5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*157.
       
      6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
         Install? YES//', respond NO.
 
      7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
         YES//', respond NO.
       
      8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
         Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
       
      9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
