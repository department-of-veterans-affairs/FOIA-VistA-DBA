Description:
============

     !!Important Note!!
     ==================
     This patch must be installed immediately after the installation of patch
     GMRA*4.0*26.
  
 This patch is the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING portion of the Remote Data
 Interoperability project.  This project's aim is to include DoD and VA wide
 data in the data set used to perform Order Checking on new patient orders.
  
 This patch also sends out a new menu option to control some aspects of the
 data collection.  This menu is "Remote Data Order Checking Parameters" [OR RDI
 PARAMS] which is under the CPRS Configuration (IRM) Menu.  There are three
 parameters that can be set using this option as follows:
  
 HAVE AN HDR
        Does this VistA system have an HDR that it can pull remote data from
        Default is OFF with patch OR*3.0*232 and ON once patch OR*3.0*238 
          is installed
 CACHE TIME (Minutes)
        How long is the cached data good for
        Default is 120 minutes
  
 This patch is exported with a new HL Logical Link that allows for the RDI 
 software to connect to the HDR-IMS sever to retrieve patient data.  The IP 
 address for this HL Logical Link is sent out empty and thus needs to be 
 manually setup by sites.  This IP address is 10.224.67.234.  The 
 instructions on how to setup the HL7 Logical Link are listed below the 
 Installation instructions in the POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section.
