Subject: TWEAK TO STANDARD REMOTE HEALTH SUMMARIES

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

  This patch addresses a problem reported by several sites when trying
  to access remote data using the Health Summary Remote Reports on the
  CPRS Reports Tab.  Some of the Remote Reports on some patients contain
  more data than can be returned within the timeout period set by
  the remote broker, which can range from 10-20 minutes.  Users become
  impatient and either CTRL-ALT-DEL out of CPRS or continually click
  on the report, causing more remote processes to begin, which further
  exacerbates the problem.  The network and the remote site becomes
  inundated with remote queries that does nothing but clog the system.
  
  We have determined that any report that contains Progress Notes has
  the potential to create this problem.  This patch is being released
  to add an occurrence limit of 50 to the Progress Notes Health Summary
  component for the following reports:
  
    REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (1Y)
    REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (3M)
    REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (4Y)
    REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (1Y)
    REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (3M)
  
  We have done some testing at some of the sites reporting this problem
  and found that setting this limit higher than 50 tends to overload the
  system.
  
  Users should be instructed to use the Progress Notes option(s) under
  Clinical Reports when there is a need to get more than 50 Notes.
  Progress Notes under Clinical Reports has greater flexibility to 
  return data within user specified time ranges and occurrence limits.
