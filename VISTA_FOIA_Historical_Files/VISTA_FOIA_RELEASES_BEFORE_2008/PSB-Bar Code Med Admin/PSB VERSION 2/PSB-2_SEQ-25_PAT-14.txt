Description:
============

  1. Problem: NOIS ISB-1102-30304
  The Drug File Inquiry [PSB DRUG INQUIRY] option does not resemble or
  follow a similar drug selection process used in other Provider Systems
  applications such as Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Pharmacy Data
  Management V. 1.0. A site is requesting modifications that will add
  consistency to the drug selection process. 
  
  Corrective Action: The Drug File Inquiry [PSB DRUG INQUIRY] option has a 
  revised continuous search index function that resembles the drug 
  selection process used in other Provider Systems applications such as 
  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0.
  
  2. Problem: NOIS NCH-1102-40363
  The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will inappropriately display
  variance information related to medication orders with a status of
  "REMOVED" on the BCMA Variance Log Report.
  
  Corrective Action: The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will not 
  display variance information related to medication orders with a status 
  of "REMOVED" on the BCMA Variance Log Report.
  
  3. Problem: NOIS MAD-0902-42331
  The Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT] option will
  improperly allow users an opportunity to enter a comment for PRN 
  medication orders that do not have a status of "GIVEN".
  
  Corrective Action: The Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT] 
  option will only allow users an opportunity to enter a comment for PRN 
  medication orders with a status of "GIVEN".
  
  4. Problem: NOIS CLL-0203-40445
  The Label Print [PSBO BL] option will not retrieve the correct drug name
  if the user enters the drug name as lower case letters.
  
  Corrective Action: The Label Print [PSBO BL] option will retrieve the 
  correct drug name if the user enters the drug name as lower case letters.
   
  5. Problem: NOIS ISB-1102-32339
  The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will only display variance
  information related to patients currently assigned to the selected ward
  on the BCMA Variance Log Report. The option will not display variances
  information associated with previous patients assigned to the selected
  wards.
  
  Corrective Action: The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will 
  rebuild the data structure used to sort, store, and display the variance 
  information related to all patients assigned to the selected ward stored 
  in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).
  
  6. Problem: NOIS MWV-0102-23190 
  The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will not display variance
  information on the BCMA Variance Log Report when the user selects to
  print the report by ward names.  Several sites are experiencing this
  problem as a result of incompatible ward names between the BCMA
  MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) and the NURS LOCATION file
  (#211.4).  In addition, sites should populate their NURS LOCATION file 
  (#211.4) with the proper ward name from the WARD LOCATION file (#42) to 
  prevent this problem from reoccurring.
  
  Corrective Action: The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will 
  compare the ward's internal entry number (IEN) stored in the BCMA 
  MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) to the ward's IEN stored in the 
  WARD LOCATION file (#42).  The BCMA application will store the ward's IEN
  for future variances.  Site must use the new Ward Name Conversion Process
  [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option under the Bar Code Medication Administration
  Manager [PSB MGR] option to convert the ward name associated with 
  previous variance information stored in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG 
  file (#53.78) in order to print a BCMA Variance Log Report based on 
  previous variance information. 
  
  The Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option is 
  temporary. However, in the future, Bar Code Medication Administration 
  patch PSB*2*23 will remove the temporary Ward Name Conversion Process 
  option from your system. The Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD
  CONVERSION] option will perform the following functions:
  
  a. Allow users to select a specified date range, which will control the 
     amount of data and time needed to complete the process.
  b. Convert the ward's name to the ward's internal entry number (IEN) if 
     the Ward Name in BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) is
     identical to the Ward Name in the WARD LOCATION file (#42).
  c. Display a list of un-identifiable ward names and allows the user to 
     make the appropriate corrections.

   Server Installation Instructions:
   =================================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
   take less than 1 minute.
  
      **Recommendation**
  
   We recommend that each site back up the data in their BCMA MEDICATION
   VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  Each site needs to associate the proper
   ward names with the ward entries in their NURS LOCATION file (#211.4),
   before using the Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION]
   option to convert the ward name to the ward internal entry number.  We
   recommend that you run this conversion option for no longer than three
   months at a time until all of the data has been converted in the BCMA
   MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).
   
      Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
      PC Client users should not be accessing the Client Software.
   
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
      2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
         be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
      3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.

        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
  
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
      5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
         PSB*2.0*14.
  
      6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
      7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//" respond NO.
  
      8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
