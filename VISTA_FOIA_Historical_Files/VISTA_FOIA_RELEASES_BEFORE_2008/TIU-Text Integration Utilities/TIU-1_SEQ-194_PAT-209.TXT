Subject: TIU ACTIVE TITLE CLEANUP REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch provides a report and automated cleanup utility to assist the 
 Data Standardization's efforts to clean and standardize TIU Document Titles.
 
 This patch is an important precursor to TIU*1*211, which maps local document 
 titles to Standard Titles in preparation for the upcoming unified Clinical 
 Data Repository/Health Data Repository of computable patient data. Using 
 this report and the automatic cleanup feature that comes with it will 
 greatly simplify the work required for document title mapping. 
 
 The report and cleanup utility will analyze the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file 
 (#8925.1) and provide an automated process to inactivate the appropriate TIU
 titles.
 
 Details for invoking the routine and option associated with this patch can 
 be found in the post-installation instructions below.

 Post install instructions:
 =========================
 This report can be run using the new menu option, Active Title Cleanup Report 
 [TIU ACTIVE TITLE CLEANUP], on the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE
 MENU], or directly from the programmer prompt by entering D EN^TIUPS209.
  
 When running the routine, the following recommendations are made:
  
      - Users may be on the system
  
      - The job should be run at a time that does not conflict with a system 
        backup
  
      - Processing times for this task will vary considerably, depending on
        the load on your system and the number of entries processed in the TIU
        DOCUMENT FILE (#8925) and TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION FILE (#8925.1). An
        estimated processing time should be less than a minute.
  
 This routine should not be deleted after it is initially used.  
 The report can be run as often as needed to track the frequency of usage for
 TIU Document Definitions and periodic inactivation of unused titles.
  
 The report will display all currently ACTIVE titles along with the number of
 instances that title has been used in the previous 365 days, the last day
 that title has been used, along with the last AUTHOR/DICTATOR of that entry.
 
 INACTIVE titles will only appear on the report if that title has been used
 in the previous 365 days.
 
 ACTIVE titles that have a document type field that points to a document 
 (in 8925.1) of type DOCUMENT CLASS or CLASS will have a *[DOCUMENT CLASS]* 
 or *[CLASS]* tag appended to the title respectively.
 
 ACTIVE titles that contain a 0 (zero) or NULL document type field will be
 displayed as UNKNOWN *[missing]* on the report and the document IENs for
 these titles will be listed at the end of the report.
 
 All ACTIVE titles with a count of 0 (zero) will be selected for automatic
 inactivation ONLY AFTER USER INTERVENTION DURING THE REPORT PROCESS.  No 
 changes will be made to file #8925.1 without consent from the user.
 
 Specific titles may be selected that will NOT be INACTIVATED even if their 
 usage count for the last year is 0.
 
 The header of the report will also contain summaries of:
 
      - Elaspsed time to run the report
      - # of active, unused titles in the previous 365 days
      - # of active, used titles in the previous 365 days
      - total # of active titles
      - current user running the report
      - date of report (T)
      - date range searched (T-365)
 
 Sample output of the report is as shown:
 
 Inactivate the unused Document Titles at this time? NO// ?
 
 Entering 'YES' will inactivate all titles unused in the past year;
 their STATUS will be changed to INACTIVE.
 
 Entering 'NO' will create the report without making any changes.
 
 Inactivate the unused Document Titles at this time? NO// YES
 
 All active titles that have not been used in the previous 365 days
 will be set to INACTIVE.
 
 You may select individual DOCUMENT TITLES that will NOT be set
 to INACTIVE by this cleanup.
 
 Are you sure you want to change their status to INACTIVE? NO// ?
 
 Entering 'YES' will inactivate all titles unused in the past year;
 their STATUS will be changed to INACTIVE.
 
 Entering 'NO' will create the report without making any changes.
 
 Are you sure you want to change their status to INACTIVE? NO//
