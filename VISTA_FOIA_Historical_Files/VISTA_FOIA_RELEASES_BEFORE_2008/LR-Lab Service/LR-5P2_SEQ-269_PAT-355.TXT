 of installation of this patch.
  
 **********************************************************************
  
 This patch corrects a SUBSCRIPT error caused by a missing SNOMED code
 when executing option LRAP and doing a SURGICAL PATHOLOGY search by 
 MORPHOLOGY code.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
 =========================
 HD116037  HAM - REPORT ERRORING OUT
  
  
 Testing Sites:
 ==============
 Hampton, VA
 Durham, NC
 Richmond, VA
 Tennessee Valley HCS
  
  
 Problem:  HD116037
 ========
 When the pathologist codes a anatomic pathology report with a morphology
 field that does not have a SNOMED code, the routine that creates the 
 report will encounter a subscript error.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The report builds a temporary global to hold the contents of the
 report. Part of the index structure of this global is made from values
 in the MORPHOLOGY FIELD file (#61.1), including the SNOMED code (#2).
 Modified LRAPSM to determine if the SNOMED code for a MORPHOLOGY FIELD
 record is missing. If it is missing, then it will use 99999999 to build
 the report index.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the systems.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. User the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This 
    option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
    You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select 
    the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that 
    all routines have the correct checksums.
  
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    options:
  
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
    If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch 
    prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
    option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
    production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare 
    a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu and 
    select the package 'LR*5.2*355'.
  
    If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    choose 'NO'.
  
    If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
