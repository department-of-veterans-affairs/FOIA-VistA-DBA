Description: 
============

 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new GUI executable file.
          Installation of this new GUI is REQUIRED in order for the patch
          to function.  The new GUI MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after
          the KIDS install in order for the software to function. ***
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client 
 Installation Instructions section.
 
 1. BCMA will display a Patient Transfer Notification Popup box, once per 
 patient session, for the Unit Dose and IVP/IVPB Medication Tabs. 
 The Popup box displays if a patient has had a recent movement, and at 
 least one of the last actions occurred within the specified timeframe 
 defined in the "Patient Transfer Notification Timeframe:" field on the 
 Parameters tab of the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. The Popup box 
 will display the patient movement type and transaction type within brackets, 
 and the Virtual Due List (VDL) will display the transaction type in the 
 "Last Action" column for a medication displayed on the VDL.
 
 Each user may have to manually resize the VDL's "Last Action" column or use 
 the Reset User Parameters [PSB USER PARAM RESET] option to see all data in 
 the "Last Action" column.
 
 2. BCMA will now document fractional dose medication orders, which occur when 
 a medication order contains a units per dose that is not a whole number. 
 When a user administers a fractional dose medication using BCMA, a Multiple 
 or a Fractional Dose dialog box will display for documenting the actual 
 amount and user comments. 
 
 3. Three fields have been removed from the Parameters tab of the GUI BCMA 
 Site Parameters application since the functionality no longer exists. They 
 include the "General System Error:" field, the "Auto Update Notification:" 
 field in the Mail Groups section of the Parameters tab and 
 the "UNC of the Auto Update Server:" field in the Misc. Options section of 
 the Parameters tab.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =====================================
  Sites can retrieve VISTA documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
      available FTP server.
 
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
