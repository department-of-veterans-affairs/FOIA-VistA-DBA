Description:
============

  
 This Date of Death (DOD) Enhancements Project is implementing software
 modifications for the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) and VistA
 applications.  The implementation is made to provide a higher
 confidence level for death dates received by the Veterans Benefits
 Administration (VBA), the HEC, and VA sites.
  
 These software modifications will allow for the synchronization of the
 Date of Death information between the HEC and VistA Systems as well as
 reduce the user (manual) workload for handling Date of Death
 information.
  
  
 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 The Date of Death Enhancements Project contains modifications to both 
 VistA and HEC Legacy applications.  This patch (IVM*2.0*102) addresses 
 the following issues:
  
 Issue I    Update Option: Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM]
       II   Update ORU~Z05 Receiver for Automatic Upload of DOD Updates
       III  Update ORU~Z05 Receiver for Automatic Upload of DOD Deletion
       IV   Correct Non-Numeric Date of Death Field Entries 
       V    Synchronize Auto-Upload of Z05 Messages with the Demographics 
            Upload 
       VI   Synchronize Date of Death fields between VistA and HEC Legacy 
            Systems.
  
  
 Issue I - Update Option: Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM]
 ======================================================================
  
 Patches DG*5.3*545 and IVM*2.0*85 (Date of Death Modifications to ZPD 
 Segment) released on March 4, 2004 added the two following fields to the 
 ZPD segments of the ORU (Unsolicited) and ORF (Solicited) Z07 (Full 
 Data/DCD Transmission) HL7 Transmission Builder:
  
     Field Name                   ZPD Segment    FILE/FIELD
     ----------                   -----------    ----------
     SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION        ZPD31          #2/#.353
     DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED    ZPD32          #2/#.354 
  
 The SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353) and DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED 
 field (#.354)were added to the PATIENT file (#2), but they did not 
 display in the Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option.
  
 This patch IVM*2.0*102 is adding the fields to the IVM DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD 
 FIELDS file (#301.92) which allows them to be viewed in the Demographics 
 Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option for review.  When an ORU~Z05 
 (Demographic Data) HL7 transmission is received for adding or updating a 
 Date of Death, the option will now display the following three fields:
  
     Field Name              Field Number
     ----------              ------------
     DATE OF DEATH                 #.351
     SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION        #.353
     DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED    #.354 
  
 Selecting any one of the Date of Death fields will result in the upload 
 of all three fields into the PATIENT file (#2).
  
 The LAST EDITED BY field (#.355) will be updated with "POSTMASTER" 
 indicating that the data was received via an ORU~Z05 HL7 message.
  
 The DEATH ENTERED BY field (#.352) will be updated with the user who 
 approved the upload of the ORU~Z05 HL7 message.
  
  
 Issue II - Update ORU~Z05 Receiver for Automatic Upload of DOD Updates
 ======================================================================
  
 When the Date of Death contained in the ORU~Z05 (Demographic Data) 
 Transmission matches the date value in the PATIENT file (#2), it 
 qualifies for an automatic upload.  The Date of Death information will be 
 updated using the data values either contained in or calculated from the 
 ORU~Z05 HL7 message as follows:
  
     o  The DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) will be updated from the message.
  
     o  If the date and time of the DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED field (#.354)
        in the message does not match the date and time in the PATIENT 
        file (#2),the DEATH ENTERED BY field (#.352) will be updated to 
        POSTMASTER.
  
     o  If the date and time of the DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED field (#.354)
        in the message matches the date and time in the PATIENT file (#2),
        the DEATH ENTERED BY field (#.352) will not be updated, and the 
        current USER ID will not be over-written.
  
     o  The SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353) will be updated from the 
        message.
  
     o  The DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED field (#.354) will be updated from 
        the message.
  
     o  The LAST EDITED BY field (#.355) will be updated with
        "POSTMASTER", indicating that the updated data was received via 
        an ORU~Z05 HL7 message.
  
  
 Issue III - Update ORU~Z05 Receiver for Automatic Upload of DOD Deletion
 ========================================================================
  
 When the ORU~Z05 (Demographic Data) Transmission contains a Date of Death 
 deletion, it qualifies for an automatic upload.  The message will be 
 processed into the PATIENT file (#2) record fields as follows:
  
     o  The DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) will be deleted.
  
     o  The DEATH ENTERED BY field (#.352) will be deleted.
  
     o  The SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353) will be deleted.
  
     o  The DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED field (#.354) will be updated with
        the date and time the HL7 transmission was received. 
  
     o  The LAST EDITED BY field (#.355) will be updated with "POSTMASTER",
        indicating that the deletion data was received via an ORU~Z05 HL7
        message.
  
  
 Issue IV - Correct Non-Numeric Date of Death Field Entries
 ========================================================================
  
 The INPUT TRANSFORM on the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) in the PATIENT 
 file (#2) was modified by a prior patch to correctly store the date of 
 the veteran's death in FileMan format. During data entry, the only 
 acceptable dates are:
  
     o  Year only
  
     o  Month and Year
  
     o  Month, Day, and Year
  
 There are some Date of Death entries containing invalid (non-FileMan 
 formatted) dates that were entered prior to the installation of the INPUT 
 TRANSFORM on the Date of Death field.  All invalid non-numeric Date of 
 Death entries will be deleted.
  
 The records in the VETERANS ID & VERIFICATION ACCESS (VIVA) File 
 (#300.11) in HEC Legacy were checked for invalid or non-numeric Date of 
 Death entries.  The sites were contacted and all the records containing 
 invalid entries were corrected.
  
  
 Issue V - Synchronize Auto-Upload of Z05 Messages with the Demographics 
           Upload
 ========================================================================
  
 When the ORU~Z05 (Demographic Data) Transmission qualifies for an 
 automatic upload, it is possible for previous messages to have been 
 received and entered into the Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] 
 menu option.
  
 This is a list of all the possible PATIENT file (#2) fields that can 
 cause an ORU~Z05 (Demographic Data) Transmission to be entered into the 
 Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option:
  
           Field Name                     Field Number

 Note: * These are Date of Death related fields
  
 When any message qualifies for an automatic upload, the process will 
 search the Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option for 
 any date of death entries.  The following business rules will be applied 
 to all records found in the Demographics Upload option for each veteran, 
 where an ORU~Z05 is automatically uploaded:
  
     o If the record contains Date of Death related field data only, the
       data will be deleted and the record will be removed from the 
       Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option.
  
     o  If the record contains a combination of Date of Death related field
        data and any other field data, only the Date of Death related 
        field data will be removed, and the record will remain in the 
        Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] menu option.
  
     o  When the record contains NO Date of Death data, no action will be 
        taken.
  
  
 Issue VI - Synchronize Date of Death fields between VistA and HEC Legacy 
            Systems
 ========================================================================
  
 The SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353) is not a required field, and 
 although it has been added to the ORU~Z07 (Full Data/DCD Transmission) 
 HL7 Transmissions to HEC Legacy, it has not been able to be uploaded.
  
 The HEC Legacy patch IVMB*2.0*800 synchronized the set of codes in the 
 VETERANS ID & VERIFICATION ACCESS (VIVA) file (#300.11) records for the 
 SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353).  The PATIENT file (#2) records 
 containing a DATE OF DEATH field (#.351)and a SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION 
 field (#.353) will be queued to send an ORU~Z07 to update the HEC 
 records. 
  
 The distribution/cleanup will be restricted to only queue five thousand 
 records daily until all records have been processed.  The limitation will 
 protect against overloading both the inbound and outbound queues in VistA 
 and at the HEC.  Another limitation on the distribution is that only 
 seven of the nine values for the SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353)
 will be queued to update the records at the HEC.  Records containing SSA 
 (Code #6) and NCA (Code #7) will not be queued.
  
 An ORU~Z07 (Full Data/DCD Transmission) HL7 Transmission will be queued 
 for PATIENT file (#2) records containing a DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) 
 and a SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION field (#.353) with one of the following
 values:
  
     o  Inpatient at VAMC (Code #1)
  
     o  Non-VA Medical Facility (Code #2)
  
     o  Death Certificate on File (Code #3)
  
     o  VBA (Code #4)
  
     o  VA Insurance (Code #5)
  
     o  Next of Kin/Family/Friend (Code #8)
  
     o  Other (Code #9)
  
  
 When the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) is blank (NULL), the fields 
 associated with the Date of Death must also be blank (NULL).  If any of 
 the following fields are not blank (NULL), the values will be deleted 
 with this post-install cleanup:
  
     o  DEATH ENTERED BY (field #.352)
  
     o  SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (field #.353)
  
  
 NOTE: The Date of Death Modifications to ZPD segment patch DG*5.3*545 was 
 released on March 4, 2004.  It added the following fields to the PATIENT 
 File (#2):
            SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION     field #.353
            DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED field #.354
  
 The PATIENT file (#2) records containing a Date of Death that was entered 
 before this patch was released will not contain field data for the two 
 fields.  If the record is edited after installing patch DG*5.3*545, the 
 software will populate the fields.
