Run Date: OCT 22, 2002                     Designation: DVBA*2.7*48
Package : DVBA - AUTOMATED MED INFO Priority: EMERGENCY
Version : 2.7        SEQ #44                    Status: Released

Subject: STOP AMIE PURGE OF HISTORICAL DATA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This is a follow-up, emergency patch to DVBA*2.7*44 which has been 
 changed to the status of entered in error. The intention of patch
 DVBA*2.7*44 was to prevent exam requests and reports from being removed
 from the AMIE 2507 EXAM (#396.4) AND 2507 REQUEST (#396.3) file by turning
 off the AMIE purge functionality.  It has since been discovered that there
 is additional code in routine  DVBCPURG to set the removal of old AMIE
 exams to 120 days if there is no defined deletion date in the field DAYS 
 TO KEEP 2507 HISTORY (.11) from the AMIE SITE PARAMETER file (396.1).
   
 The AMIE purge of an exam request and its results takes place when the 
 status of an exam is one of 4 categories: 'C' FOR COMPLETED, PRINTED BY
 RO; 'X' FOR CANCELLED BY MAS; 'RX' FOR CANCELLED BY RO; and 'CT' FOR
 COMPLETED, TRANSFERRED OUT. Exams of other status types will not be purged
 by the automated functionality.
  
 **************************************************************************
 It is requested that sites remove the options "DVBA C PURGE 2507" and
 "DVBA REGIONAL PURGING PROGRAM" from Taskman if they are currently being
 utilized. The process to do this will be explained later in this
 description. These purge options were originally scheduled to run with the
 install of AMIE version 2.7.
  
 The AMIE purge options will be put out of order and removed from menus in
 patch DVBA*2.7*45 when it is released later this year.
 **************************************************************************
  
 For sites that keep duplicate copies of exam results in TIU, those 
 results will still be available through CPRS although a request may no
 longer be visible directly in AMIE. For sites that do not currently place
 results in TIU, the Regional Office prints exam results and stores them in
 the claims file, so they may always be retrieved on paper should they be
 needed. Please contact the regional office who is managing the claims file
 should printouts be needed.
