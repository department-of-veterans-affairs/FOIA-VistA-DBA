Subject: MISSING IMLOG CROSS REFERENCE FOR BCBU

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ********************Important Note***************
  
   If the site is running the BCMA Contingency software then this
   patch must also be installed on the workstations. Once installed
   it is suggested that the sites review the Contingency system 
   reports. 
  
 *************************************************
  
  
 Issues addressed in this patch are as follows: 
  
 1. It was reported that after loading Patch PSB*3*8, the medication log 
    history was no longer printing. 
        Example:...
             BCMA MEDICATION LOG HISTORY
             Log Date        Message        Log Entry Person
             No entries since the above date are on file.
    This was caused by a missing cross reference (IMLOG) in file 53.7. 
    Cross reference has been added.
  
 2. It was reported that the Print all option was not working correctly. 
    Routine ALPBPALL has been corrected.
