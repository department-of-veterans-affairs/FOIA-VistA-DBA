 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) NTH-1103-70445    Create new spine worksheet 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Audrey Tomlinson has requested an update to the current AMIE  
    worksheet for SPINE.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    a) Created routine DVBA60PI that will deactivate the current spine 
       worksheet (file #396.6 ien of 174), and activate the new spine
       worksheet (file #396.6 ien of 182).
    b) Created routine DVBCWNS5 that contains the text of the new spine 
       worksheet. 
    c) Created routine DVBCWNS4 to access the text routines in b),
       and print the new spine worksheet.
