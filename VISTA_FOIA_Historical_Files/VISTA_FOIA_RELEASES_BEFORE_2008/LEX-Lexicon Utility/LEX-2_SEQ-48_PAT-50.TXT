    Routine Fixes
 
       Global Import                   LEXXGI and LEXXGI2
 
          The LEXXGI and LEXXGI2 routines are responsible for reading 
          and installing the data in the Import Global ^LEXM during the 
          Post-install process.  Missing code in both LEXXGI and LEXXGI2
          was added.  This missing code was not discovered in patch 
          LEX*2.0*49 since LEX*2.0*49 had no Import global.  Additionally,
          a line of test code found in LEXXGI2 has been removed.  
 
       Installation Information        LEXXII
 
          Routine LEXXII was modified to report the calling of the protocol
          LEXICAL SERVICES UPDATE after the install of the ^LEXM global. 
          This was not discovered in patch LEX*2.0*49 since LEX*2.0*49 did
          not install data from import global ^LEXM.
         
 
  FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
 
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_50.GBL  (ASCII)
 
    The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov,
    which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
 
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations.
 
         Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
         Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
         Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
 
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
 
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
 
     1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*50.
         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take less than 15 minutes to install.
 
     2)  Create a backup of the following globals files before continuing:
 
             Global Content        File #          Global
             ----------------    ----------        ----------
             CPT Procedures         #81            ^ICPT
             CPT Categories         #81.1          ^DIC(81.1)
             CPT Modifiers          #81.3          ^DIC(81.3)
             Lexicon Files       #757-757.41       ^LEX
 
 
     3)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
         not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you 
         will need to kill this global before proceeding.
 
         On a Cache system, the prevention of unsubscripted global kills
         is a system wide setting, but it can be allowed for a particular 
         process using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling 
         unsubscripted global kills is:
 
             VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
             VAH>K ^LEXM
 
         The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
         is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and
         creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
 
     4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_50.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
 
         Thin Client Global Restore
 
           Using the Cache Thin Client, right-click on the Cache 
           cube, then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces"
           folder, then open the "VAH" folder, and right click on
           the "Globals" folder. Select the "Import from disk" 
           option. Click on the "Options..." button.  Select the 
           "Globals" tab, make sure the format is VAX DSM, then 
           click "OK." Find the file in the directory, double click
           on LEX_2_50.GBL.  Next, select "Import All."  At the 
           prompt "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select "Yes."
 
         Programmer Mode
 
           From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
 
             >D ^%GI
 
             Global input
 
             Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_50.GBL Parameter: RS=>
             Globals were saved on 30 May 2007  16:47 PM  Cache
             with description: LEX*2.0*50/ICPT*6.0*36 Data
 
             Input option: A
               ^LEXM
 
         The loading of the global should take less than 3 minutes.
 
     5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
 
     6)  Distribution Load:
 
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
 
     7)  KIDS Installation:
 
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*50.  The KIDS
         installation should take less than fifteen minutes depending 
         on the number of users/jobs on the system.
 
         Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
         the install?" prompt.
 
         Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options,
         Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
 
     8)  Cleanup
 
         a)  Check that the export global ^LEXM has been killed 
             automatically. 
 
             If it has not been automatically killed, you will need to 
             kill the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent 
             import global checksum errors on future installations.
 
             On a Cache system, the prevention of unsubscripted global 
             kills is a system wide setting, but it can be allowed for a
             particular process using the $ZU command.  The command for
             enabling unsubscripted global kills is:
 
                  VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                  VAH>K ^LEXM
 
             The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
             is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process
             and creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
 
         b)  The Environment Check routine LEX2050 and the Post-Install 
             routine LEX2050P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
             'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the
             installation.
