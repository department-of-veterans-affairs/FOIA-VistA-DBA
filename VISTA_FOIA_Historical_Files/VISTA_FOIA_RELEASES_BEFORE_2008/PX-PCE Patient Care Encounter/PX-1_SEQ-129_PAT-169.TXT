Subject: ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS FOR CANCELLED APPOINTMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the anomaly that when adding a Standalone
 Encounter for an appointment with the same Date/Time and Clinic
 the Encounter nodes are not created in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER
 (#409.68) file.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 HD64474 (FGH-1204-30359) Notes on cancelled appointments
              not creating entry in 409.68
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 When using option [PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY] and the
 action AD - Add Standalone Encounter for an appointment with
 the same date/time and clinic that was previously cancelled, the
 OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file will not be updated with the 
 new encounter.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 Modify routine PXCEVFIL to check for a previously cancelled appoint-
 ment when using the AD-Add Standalone Encounter action to prevent
 this anomaly.
  
 Also, a new ticket was generated to handle the CPRS GUI environment
 that allows an encounter to be added when entering TIU notes.  A
 similar look-up will have to be added to prevent encounters being 
 created for a cancelled appointment for the same Date/Time and
 Clinic.
