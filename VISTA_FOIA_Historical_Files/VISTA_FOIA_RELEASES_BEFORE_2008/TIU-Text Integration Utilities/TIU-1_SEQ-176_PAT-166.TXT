Subject: TIU Update for Templates that contain Reminder Dialogs

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains an update for templates that contain reminder dialogs. 
 New logic has been added to reminder dialog in Clinical Reminders 2.0. 
 This new logic allows for reminder term to be evaluated when loading a dialog 
 element/group. Depending on the term evaluation the dialog element/group 
 can branch to another dialog/element. The code change in TIUSRVT allowed 
 for this functionality to work in Reminder Dialog assigned to a TIU 
 Template. See the Clinical Reminders 2.0 Set-up guide section for dialog 
 branching logic for more information.
 
 This patch also releases two new National TIU Objects:
 
        VA-GEC DEMOGRAPHIC
        VA-GEC STATUS
 
 Objects description:
 ===================
 VA-GEC DEMOGRAPHIC
 Automatically populates the TIU document associated with the VA-GEC Social 
 Services dialog with patient demographic data.  Data elements include the 
 patient's Service Connected rating and LTC Co-pay Status.
 
 VA-GEC STATUS
 Displays the status of the current GEC Referral on the VA-GEC Care 
 Coordination dialog.  This object includes the current completion status of 
 GEC dialogs.  It also displays the status of the associated TIU document, 
 including the author and entry date of the document.
 
 Also released with this patch is a modification to how TIU handles deletion 
 of notes that have Health Factor associated to the visit the note was 
 made for. This modification is to help support the GEC project release with 
 Clinical Reminders 2.0.

 TIUEDI1 was modified to add a call to a Clinical Reminders Routine that is 
 associated with the GEC project. A reference to DEL^PXRMGECU was added to

 Factor file when ever a progress note is deleted that was associated with 
 the GEC dialogs.
