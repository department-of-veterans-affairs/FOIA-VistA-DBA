Description:
============

 The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
 Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
 ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic transmission
 of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers and the receipt 
 of claim responses (including drug utilization review responses and 
 warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and introduced in a 
 phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy was utilized due 
 to the complexity of the functionality and the number of product line 
 dependencies.
  
 The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1.0, comprised of
 the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
 namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
 PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation. The patches
 are combined in host file BPS_1_0.KID in order to simplify installation.
 BPS*1.0 is a dormant release that only allows each site to perform
 preliminary setup work and to confirm that the software does not adversely
 affect other packages.  The software for IB*2.0*251 is installed
 automatically when the host file, BPS_1_0.KID, is installed.
  
 This is the IB*2.0*251 patch, and it provides modified and new components 
 associated with the following specific requirements:
 * Send Interface Version Number in e-IIV Registration Message.
 * Update Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) Table
 * Update NCPDP Processor Table
 * Update Payer Table
 * Update Plan Table
 * Update Pharmacy Plan Table
 * Provide Pharmacy Plan NCPDP Claim Submission Status and Information via
 Callable Routine
 * Display Pharmacy Plan Information Based on User Selected Sort Criteria
 * Display Qualified Group Plans to Help Link Pharmacy Plan to Group
 Insurance Plan
 * Link Pharmacy Plan to Group Insurance Plan
 * Link Pharmacy Plan to Multiple Group Insurance Plan
 * Link Test Payer Sheet to Pharmacy Plan
 * Edit Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) Local Active Flag
 * Edit NCPDP Processor Local Active Flag
 * Edit Payer Local Active Flag
 * Edit Plan / Pharmacy Plan Local Active Flag
 * Edit HIPAA NCPDP Flag
 * Store and Track Banking Identification Numbers (BIN) and Processing
 Control Numbers (PCN) From Patient Insurance Cards
  
 The Vitria Interface Engine (IE) BusinessWare product will be utilized in 
 this project.   The IE will provide:
 * HL7 message routing tables for directing incoming and outgoing VistA
 HL7 messages
 * HL7 message translation mechanisms for handling various versions of
 VistA compatible HL7 messages
 * HL7 message error handling capability
 * Data mapping utility
