Subject: LIMIT PERSONAL DATA DISPLAY ON AGENT CASHIER'S RECEIPT, OTHER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 4 issues. The first issue is that the display
 of the credit card number is now limited to the last 4 digits. Second, 
 the Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] option now shows the 
 correct amount of $8 rather than $7. The third and fourth fixes are
 to the printing features of the EFT Deposit Reconciliation Report 
 [RCDPE DEPOSIT RECON REPORT] option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD120632 Personal Data on Agent Cashier's Receipt
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a credit card payment is posted through the Receipt Processing
    option, the credit card number and 3 digit confirmation number are
    printed on the patient's receipt. Sites have requested that the credit 
    card number display be limited to keep patient data secure.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCDPRECT to display the last 4 digits of the credit
    card number, and the label for the data on the payment receipt has
    been changed to 'Last 4 of Credit Card #' as well.
  
 2. HD126573 cashier's display uses $7 instead of $8 for Rx Copay charges
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The agent cashier has been receiving the following message while
    running the NP (New Payment) action in the Receipt Processing option.
    The option is showing $7 instead of $8 for RX Copay charges.
  
    'This patient has 1-30 day RX's totaling $7.00 that are potentially
     billable. This represents any Window Rx's issued today.'
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCDPURED to update the potentially billable estimate
    for RX Copay charges with $8 to reflect the display message correctly.
  
 3. HD133395 PRCA undefined error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that the EFT Deposit Reconciliation Report [RCDPE 
    DEPOSIT RECON REPORT] option failed when they queued the report to
    P-MESSAGE.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCDPEREC to set up the ZTSAVE variables for queueing
    process to avoid an undefined error at line RUN+3^%ZTMS3.
  
 4. HD90431  When you que option RCDPE DEPOSIT RECON REPORT
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When you queue the EFT Deposit Reconciliation Report [RCDPE DEPOSIT 
    RECON REPORT] option to a printer or spool you will get an undefined 
    error at line RUN+3^%ZTMS3.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Same fix as issue #3.
