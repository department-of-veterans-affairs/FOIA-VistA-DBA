       This patch fixes several problems with menu templates: 
  
  1. The selection of a numbered choice outside of the range of the actual
 list could cause an <UNDEF> (DAY-0497-42420 and BYN-0297-10733).
  
  2. Failure to reenter the primary tree when backing up from a secondary
 tree (DAY-1295-41818).
  
  3. The inability to skip an option in a template by hitting a RETURN
 (FNC-1297-30868).
  
  4.  Prevents the selection of a broker-type option when creating a menu
 template.
   
       **PLEASE NOTE**  THE SOFTWARE NOW DISPLAYS THE TEXT OF EACH OPTION IT
  PROCESSES AS IT DOES SO.  YOUR USERS WILL, THEREFORE, NOTICE A CHANGE IN
  BEHAVIOR AS MENU TEMPLATES RUN.
   
   
       This patch contains 4 routines and 1 help frame.
