Description:
============

 ****************************** ATTENTION *******************************
 An issue was introduced with patch PSO*7*260 that removed the display
 of Dosage, Verb, Dispense Unit, Noun, Route, and Schedule from the
 VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option.  This functionality is restored in
 PSO*7*264 Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch. 
  
 It is suggested that the Q4 Pharmacy Enhancements patch PSO*7*264 be 
 installed immediately after the ePharmacy/ECME Enhancements bundle of 
 patches in order to restore full functionality of the option.
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  Below is a list of all the applications
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*260
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*363
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*5
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*127
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0  PSX*2*63
  
 The first three patches (BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260) will be
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 2.0.  Patches PSX*2*63 and
 PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an
 implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution and the
 stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed prior to
 the installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions
 please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
  
 All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they
 have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).
 After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the 
 site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy
 product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not
 to activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
  
 This patch modifies the ECME v1.0 application as described below:
  
 1. ECME Reversal not sent
    When ECME performs a reversal/resubmit, ECME checks the IB Billing
    Determination for the prescription (Rx).  The code has been updated
    so that ECME will process the reversal (when appropriate), regardless
    of the Billing Determination.  If the Rx is not billable, ECME will
    not resubmit the claim.
  
 2. Add User Name to ECME Comments
    The ECME user screen has been modified to display the username of the 
    user who entered a comment via the ECME User Screen or on the Pharmacy
    side.  Additional edits on comments will not overwrite the original
    user name.
  
 3. Refill values for ECME claims
    When processing a prescription refill, the quantity of the original 
    fill was being sent to IB Billing Determination and to the
    third-party payer.  The code has been updated so that for a refill
    prescription, the refill quantity will be sent to IB Billing
    Determination and to the third-party payer.
  
    Similarly, for a prescription refill, the days supply for the original 
    fill was being sent to IB Billing Determination (the correct value
    was already being sent to the third-party payer).  The code has been
    updated so that for a refill prescription, the days supply value from
    the refill will be sent to IB Billing Determination.
  
 4. ECME Nightly Background Job
    The ECME Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB] has
    been updated to purge the BPS LOG file (#9002313.12) for any data over
    one year old.
  
 5. Statistics Screen Change Request
    There have been several changes to the Statistics Screen [BPS
    STATISTICS SCREEN] option and these are listed below.
    a. The header now displays the date that the statistics were last
       cleared.
    b. The name of the display field 'Paper or Unbillable' was modified to
       be 'Dropped to Paper'.  This field will display the number of
       claims that were dropped to paper via the Close Rejected Claims
       action [BPS PRTCL USRSCR CLOSE] of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER
       SCREEN] option.
    c. A new display field called 'Accepted Reversals' was added.  This
       field will display the number of reversals that were accepted by
       the third-party payer.
    d. A new display field called 'Rejected Reversals' was added.  This
       field will display the number of reversals that were rejected by
       the third-party payer.
    e. A new display field 'Errors' was added.  This field displays the
       number of claim/reversals that had programming or data errors which
       prevented the completion of claims processing.
  
 6. ECME Claims/ECME Response Inquiry Option
    A new option called the ECME Claims-Response Inquiry option [BPS
    RPT CLAIMS RESPONSE] has been added to the Other Reports menu option
    [BPS MENU RPT OTHER].  This option will allow the user to enter
    a VA Claim ID and see the transaction data, the claim data sent
    to the third-party payer and the response that was returned.  This
    option may assist the sites and/or the VistA Maintenance Project (VMP)
    team determine the cause of a reject that is received from a payer.
  
 7. Changes to the Status Message
    The status messages have been updated to more accurately reflect the 
    actual work that is being done by the ECME engine.  These messages are
    the IN PROGRESS status messages displayed by the user screen as well as
    the messages displayed while a claim is being processed.
  
 8. Pharmacy Encapsulation updates
    ECME gets much of the data that is needed to process claims from 
    the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file and the OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file of the
    Outpatient Pharmacy applications.  Because of the Pharmacy
    Re-engineering project, some of the Interagency Agreements that were
    in place to support ECME reads of the above files have expired.
    Thus, ECME was required to use newly created APIs developed by the
    Pharmacy Re-engineering team.  The ECME code was modified to use these
    new APIs.
  
 9. Standards and Conventions (SAC) compliance updates
    In the active release (BPS*1.0*1), ECME was granted a waiver for some 
    SAC compliance issues with the understanding that these issues would be
    fixed in the next phase of ECME.  The SAC compliance issues that
    were fixed in this release are:
    a.  Symbol Table cleanup issues (SAC section 2.3.1.9).
    b.  Formal parameter List (SAC section 2.3.1.10).
    c.  Incorrect use of BPS namespaced globals as temporary globals (SAC
        section 2.3.2.5).
  
 10. Remove Obsolete Indian Health Service (IHS) components
     In order to facilitate the Pharmacy Encapsulation updates and the SAC
     Compliance updates listed above, some obsolete IHS code and components
     were deleted.
  
 11. Remove EPHARM IN logical link
     During the course of the previous year, the Austin Automation Center
     started to send Payer Sheet transactions and registration
     acknowledgements to the Health Level Seven (HL7) multi-threaded
     listener at the VistA sites instead of sending these transactions to
     the EPHARM IN logical link.  Because of this, the EPHARM IN logical
     link is no longer used and has been deleted.
  
 12. Update Auto-Reversal Text to be more accurate
     The auto-reversal MailMan message was indicating that auto-reversed
     claims were completed.  This was inaccurate as the auto-reversed 
     claims may be stranded on the HL7 queue at the time the MailMan
     message was sent.  The message has been modified to indicate that the
     auto-reversal claims have been submitted instead of completed.
  
 13. Changes to support Prior Authorization data from Outpatient Pharmacy
     ECME has been modified to accept prior authorization data from
     Outpatient Pharmacy so that it can be included in an ECME claim sent
     to the third-party payer.  The data that is being sent is the Prior
     Authorization Type Code field, which is being used to populate the
     461-ET (Prior Authorization Type Code) field of a National Council
     for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPCP) claim, and the Prior
     Authorization Number, which is being used to populate the 462-EU
     (Prior Authorization Number) field of a NCPDP claim.
  
 14. ECME User Screen Claim Log
     The Print Claim Log action [BPS PRTCL USRSCR CLAIM LOG] of the ECME
     User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN] was updated to display the VA
     Claim ID for every submission related to an ECME transaction.
  
 15. The Resubmit with edits updates
     The Resubmit Claim w/EDITS action [BPS PRTCL USRSCR RESUBMIT EDITS]
     of the ECME User Screen option [BPS USER SCREEN] was modified to allow
     two additional claim fields to be edited.  When resubmitting rejected
     claims using the protocol, users now have the ability to edit the
     Prior Authorization Type Code (461-EU) and the Prescription
     Clarification Code (420-DK).
  
 16. Add National Drug Code (NDC) to several ECME claims reports
     Five of the ECME claims reports - The Payable Claims Report option
     [BPS RPT PAYABLE], the Reversal Claims Report option [BPS RPT
     REVERSAL, the Claims Submitted Not Yet Released Report option [BPS RPT
     NOT RELEASED], the Recent Transactions Report option [BPS RPT RECENT
     TRANSACTIONS], and the Closed Claims Report option [BPS RPT CLOSED
     CLAIMS] - were modified to display the drug's NDC code for each claim
     displayed on the reports.
  
 17. Updates to use Metric Quantities in claims
     ECME was updated to get the Metric Quantity from the PDM 
     application and put the data into the 442-E7 (Quantity Dispensed)
     field of a NCPDP claim.
  
 18. Remove Print Data action from the ECME User Screen
     The Print Data action [BPS PRTCL USRSCR PRINT] was removed from
     the list of actions on the ECME User Screen option [BPS USER
     SCREEN].  This action was a duplicate of the Print List action [VALM
     PRINT LIST] on the hidden menu.
  
 19. Remove Print Data action from the Print Claim Log screen
     The Print Data action [BPS PRTCL USRSCR PRINT] was removed from
     the list of actions on the Print Claim Log screen option [BPS
     PRTCL USRSCR CLAIM LOG].  This action was a duplicate of the Print
     List action [VALM PRINT LIST] on the hidden menu.
  
 20. The NCPDP standard states that field Patient Relationship Code
     (306-C6) is the 'Code indicating relationship of patient to
     cardholder' and has possible values '0=Not Specified,
     1=Cardholder, 2=Spouse, 3=Child, 4=Other'.  The code was not always
     following the NCPDP standard in all cases.  The code has been updated
     to send the correct value in all cases.
  
 21. The code was modified to pull the data for NCPDP field 
     Software/Vendor Certification ID (110-AK) from the PLAN (#366.03)
     file instead of the BPS NCPDP FORMATS (#9002313.92) file.  This
     should reduce the number of AK (M/I Software/Vendor Certification
     ID) rejections.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. Remedy Ticket 68514 (ISD-1204-70881  POINTER FILES DO NOT EXIST)
 2. Remedy Ticket 167145 (Epharm Issue at Madison (607))
 3. Remedy Ticket 179739 (Patients not transmitting to CMOP)
 4. Remedy Ticket 197054 (RX Not Processing) 
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. Remedy Ticket 68514 (ISD-1204-70881  POINTER FILES DO NOT EXIST) - The 
    site identified several fields in the BPS SETUP file (#9002313.99) that
    pointed to other files that did not exist.  All of these fields have
    been deleted.
  
 2. Remedy Ticket 167145 (Epharm Issue at Madison (607)) - The system 
    clock at Madison was not in synch.  Since ECME uses several background
    jobs that are executed on different nodes of the cluster, the end time
    for the ECME transaction was sometimes recorded as chronically earlier
    than the submission time of the request.  This was causing the
    transaction to erroneously be reported as IN PROGRESS.  The code has
    been fixed to account for this scenario.
  
 3. Remedy Ticket 179739 (Patients not transmitting to CMOP) - This ticket
    was entered by Cincinnati and is a duplicate of Remedy Ticket 167145
    above.
  
 4. Remedy Ticket 197054 (RX Not Processing) - This ticket was entered by
    Louisville and is a duplicate of Remedy Ticket 167145 above.

 the items below.
  
     1.  Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
         by the BPS Nightly Background Job option [BPS NIGHTLY
         BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job to finish or complete the
         installation before this job starts.
     2.  Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being 
         transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish 
         or complete the installation before the transmission starts.  
         Check with Pharmacy Service or your pharmacy Automated Data
         Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to find out when
         CMOP transmissions occur.
     3.  In addition, note that you will be prompted to disable the
         following options during the installation:
           ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
           Patient Insurance Info View/Edit option [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
           Third Party Joint Inquiry option [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]

 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 There is a bug in the KIDs installation process for multi-builds.  Even
 though you may have requested that the menu rebuild occur for patches
 BPS*1*5 and PSO*7*260 while answering the installation questions, it is 
 possible that the menu rebuild did not occur.  If the rebuild did not
 occur and your system does not do an automatic menu rebuild in a nightly
 TaskMan process, you should do a manual rebuild via the Build Primary Menu
 Trees option [XQBUILDTREE] found in the Menu Rebuild Menu [XQBUILDMAIN]
 option.
  
 The BPS post-install routine delivered with BPS*1*5 will do the tasks
 listed below.  This post-install will be tasked and may take several
 hours to run.  When it is complete, it will send an email to the installer
 and the users in the BPS OPECC mail group.  The post-install routines
 BPS01P5* are being left on the system after the install.  They will be
 deleted with a future patch.
    1.  Delete the files listed in the 'The following is a list of files
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    2.  Delete the fields listed in the 'The following is a list of fields
        deleted in this patch:' section of the BPS*1*5 patch.
    3.  Delete obsolete records from the BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91)
        file.  These records are for National Council for Prescription Drug
        Programs (NCPDP) version 3x, which make these records obsolete.
    4.  Populate the new BPS STATISTICS file (#9002313.58) categories
        (Accepted Reversals, Rejected Reversals, and Dropped to Paper).
    5.  Populate the new SUBMIT DATE/TIME (#6) field of the BPS
        TRANSACTIONS file (#9002313.59).
    6.  Convert the ECME log data from global ^BPSECP("LOG") to the new
        BPS LOG file (#9002313.12).
    7.  Convert the submit processing queue from global ^BPSECP("BPSOSRX")
        to the temporary global ^XTMP("BPS-PROC").
  
 The IB post-install routine delivered with IB*2*363 will populate the
 E-PHARMACY DIVISION field (#.09) of the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14).
 This is a new field delivered with this patch.  The time required to
 accomplish this task may vary from site to site and is dependent upon how
 many electronic pharmacy claims are processed daily at the site.  The post
 install routine IB20P363 is being left on the system after the install.  
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
  
 The PSO post-install routine delivered with PSO*7*260 will set the
 REJECT INFO sub-file (#52.25) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) as READ
 ONLY.  This will prevent users from entering rejects through FileMan,
 which causes problems to the Outpatient Pharmacy application.  The post
 install routine PSO260PI is being left on the system after the install.
 It will be deleted with a future patch.
