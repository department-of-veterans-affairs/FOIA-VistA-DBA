Description:
============

 This patch is made in support of patient safety issues identified by the 
 Health Data and Informatics Program Office and the National Center for 
 Patient Safety (NCPS) when catastrophic edits result in altering patient 
 identity fields within electronic health records.
  
 Patient Identity Fields:  
        Patient Name (First and/or Last Name Components)
        Social Security Number
        Date of Birth
        Sex
  
 Patch MPIF*1.0*37 will be released separately to address the display of
 Patient identity fields that are blank or requiring editing at the
 beginning of the registration process.
  
 This patch DG*5.3*638 will place all of the patient identity fields within
 one screen.  It will also provide additional prompts and alerts within the
 Registration Intake process that will ensure that users are fully aware of
 the impact of modifications to more than one patient identity fields which
 can impact patient care throughout the entire Department of Veterans
 Affairs (VA).   The alerts will provide local staff with sufficient
 information for follow-up with users who repeatedly modify two or more of
 the four key patient identity fields within one edit session.
  
  
 1).  The PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SCREEN <1> will display the SEX field. 
  
 2).  At the time of the Registration Intake process, when two or more
      edits are made to the patient identity fields a warning message will
      be displayed to the user making modifications to the patient:
  
  
                          **WARNING!!**
  
 The edits you are about to make, may potentially change the identity of
 this patient.  Please verify that you have selected the correct patient
 and ensure that supporting documentation exists for these changes.  If
 you continue with these edits, an alert will be generated and sent to
 your Supervisor and ADPAC, notifying them of the changes.
 Do you wish to continue and save your edits:? NO// 
  
 2A). Answering 'NO' will not save the edits being made and you will
      return to the PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SCREEN <1> with the original
      patient information intact.
  
 2B). Answering 'YES' will save the edits and the user will return to the 
      PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SCREEN <1>.  An alert with the potential
      patient catastrophic edits will be forwarded to your site's ADPAC and
      appropriate supervisor for review and action.
  
 3).  This patch creates a new Security key (DG CATASTROPHIC EDIT) that
      will need to be distributed to the appropriate supervisor and ADPAC
      in order for them to receive and review the alerts.  If the Security
      key (DG CATASTROPHIC EDIT) is not assigned, the alert (with review)
      and a mail message will be forwarded to those users holding the
      Security key (DG SUPERVISOR). In addition a mail message will be sent
      to the MPIF Exceptions Mail Group notifying them the DG Catastrophic
      Edit key has not been assigned.
  
 3A). Alerts forwarded to your site's ADPAC and appropriate supervisor
      will highlight before and after edits of the patient identification
      fields. Mother's Maiden name, Place of Birth for both city and state
      are included to assist with patient identity.
  
 3B). In addition, the after edits of the patient identification fields
      will display an asterisk to highlight the edited fields that have
      been modified when the alert was generated.
  
 3C). The alert will prompt the supervisor if the patient information has
      been reviewed.
  
 3D). An alert will remain on the user's active alert screens until the
      alert is reviewed ('YES' response).
  
 3E). The supervisor who has reviewed the alert will be prompted with a
      follow up prompt, asking if the patient alert was determined to be a
      catastrophic edit ('YES' or 'NO').
  
 3F). Only, after the alert has been reviewed, will it allow the supervisor
      the option to remove the alert, or, keep it under their active screen
      alerts.
  
 3G). Alerts will remain for retention in the ALERT TRACKING (#8992.1) File
      for 365 days.
  
 4).  This patch installs a new report in the 'Registration Menu' [DG
      REGISTRATION MENU].  This report, 'Report - Patient Catastrophic
      Edits' [DG PATIENT CE REPORT], will provide the viewer a listing (up
      to one year) of posted potential catastrophic alerts, alerts
      reviewed, and alerts determined to be catastrophic edits.  It will
      list as a summary of totals, or display a detailed listing of all the
      information contained in the alert.

 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 ------------------------------------------------------------- 
 20041009 - Preventing Catastrophic Edits to Identity
   
   
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy ticket(s):
 --------------------------------------------------------- 
 BAC-0204-41147      PATIENT RECORDS SWITCHED
  
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------
 BAC-0204-41147      PATIENT RECORDS SWITCHED
 Problem:  Clerk mistakenly changed existing patient data to another 
 patient's information.
  
 Resolution:  Patch MPIF*1*37 will decrease the possibility of mistakenly 
 editing patient data, by displaying for edit only those fields that are
 blank or requiring editing changes.  This patch, DG*5.3*638, will increase
 the awareness of potential catastrophic edits to patient identity to the 
 appropriate supervisors.
