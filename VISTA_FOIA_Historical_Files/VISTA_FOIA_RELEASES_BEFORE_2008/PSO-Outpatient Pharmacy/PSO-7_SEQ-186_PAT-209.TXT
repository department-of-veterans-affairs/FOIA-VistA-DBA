  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch will correct three problems.
   1.  The Drug Accountability package is not updated for Outpatient
       Pharmacy prescriptions, when dispensed through Outpatient 
       Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI)
   2.  Prescriptions are marked as Released in VistA when the OPAI
       devices mark them as Not filled
   3.  Refills released through OPAI do not bill Co-pays.
  
  
 1. HD90401 - Drug Accountability not pulling OP dispensing
 ==========================================================
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the new OPAI interface and prescriptions are filled by the 
 External dispensing machines and released, VistA is updated, but there is 
 no updating of the Drug Accountability package.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Add calls to the Drug Accountability package in the OPAI completion 
 message code in the same manner in which the manual release functions 
 currently do.
  
  
 2. HD87607 - Problem Data Sent Back to VISTA from Optifill.
 ===========================================================
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the new OPAI interface and External dispensing machines send 
 back a message that they did Not fill a prescription, VistA is releasing 
 the prescription as if the machine did dispense the medication.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correctly update the Activity log in the PRESCRIPTION file #52 with the 
 error message that the medication was not dispensed by the external 
 machine and do not perform the release function.
  
  
 3. HD101123 - Refills not billing Co-pay.
 =========================================
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the new OPAI interface and a refill is dispensed by an 
 External dispensing machine, Co-pays are not being billed.  The fill 
 number variable used by the Co-pay Logic was not being initialized and
 therefore was not billed.  This only applies to sites that are running 
 the new two-way interface and have the FILE RELEASE DATE/TIME field 
 (#105.1) set to Yes in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correctly initialize the fill number variable so Co-pay logic will
 correctly handle and bill this refill.
