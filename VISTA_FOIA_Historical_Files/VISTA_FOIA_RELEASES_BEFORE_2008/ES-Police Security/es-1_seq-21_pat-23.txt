Subject: FIX TIME2 VARIABLE IN ESPAJE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   The routine modification included in this patch has been made to 
   address the issue raised in NOIS entry HUN-0498-21140.
   
   The following Police & Security option is affected:
   
   Add a Journal Entry             [ESP ADD JOURNAL ENTRY]
   
   The problem occurs whenever the last journal entry made by the 
   user was for a time between midnight and 1:00 AM.  Then on the next
   use of the option, the user will see a default time which is less
   than the required four digits.  If the user tries to accept that
   default, it is rejected by the system since it  is not in the
   required 4-digit format.
   
   To correct this problem, the setting of variable TIME2 in routine 
   ESPAJE at line LAST+18 has been modified.

       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
