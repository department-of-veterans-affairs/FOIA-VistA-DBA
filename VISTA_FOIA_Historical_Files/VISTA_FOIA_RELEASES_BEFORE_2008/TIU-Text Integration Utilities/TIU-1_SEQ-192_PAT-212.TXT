 PROBLEM:
 ========
 Under certain conditions when using TIU Document Parameter Edit the 
 pointer to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (8925.1) can be changed
 in the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERS file (8925.95) without changing the
 Document Description.  This causes the loss of document parameters
 for the original document.
  
 RESOLUTION:
 ===========
 The code has been corrected to update the pointer to TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITION file (8925.1) correctly.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 A post-init routine is included in the patch.  It will look for titles
 in the TIU Document Parameter file (8925.95) that could be a problem. 
 These titles will all contain a number within the title. A mail message
 will be sent to the installer of the patch and will contain any titles
 whose parameters should be researched.  This mail message should be
 forwarded to the appropriate party (CAC) at the site to verify
 the parameters of the titles that are listed. If a title on the list
 should not be there, have IRM do a fileman lookup into the TIU
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION FILE (8925.1) using the numeric character found in
 the title as the IEN (i.e.  `1650). This may indicate the title that was
 swapped. This routine can be run at anytime from the programmer prompt.
