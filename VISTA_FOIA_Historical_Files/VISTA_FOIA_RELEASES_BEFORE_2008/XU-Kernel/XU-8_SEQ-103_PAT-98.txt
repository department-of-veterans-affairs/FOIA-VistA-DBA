Subject: Protocol file DD Cleanup

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  This patch is to re-namespace the routines called from within the protocol
  file from OR* routine to XQOR* routines.   It turns out that only 2
  routines and the compiled cross-references needed to be changed.
  The 2 routine are ORDD101 to XQORD101 and ORDD1 to XQORDD1 and the X-ref
  from ORD1 to XQORC.

  ========================================================================= 
  Installation:
   
    1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
       
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
       
    4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
        users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
        acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
        Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
   
       
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*98'
                               =========
                               
          No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                          ==
       
    6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
