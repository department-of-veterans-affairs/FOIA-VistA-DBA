Description:
============

 1. CPH-0203-41084 
    When using the options Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
    ORDERS] and Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] to complete a 
    pending order, if the number of refills is five and the days supply is 60,
    the current logic calculates the maximum number of refills to two instead
    of five. This patch corrects this issue by modifying the maximum refills
    calculation to account for this scenario.
  
 2. CLE-0203-40018
    The Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option provides
    a hidden ListMan speed refill action called Refill (RF) to refill a
    prescription or multiple prescriptions. The Refill (RF) action was not
    performing all the necessary checks before allowing the prescription to be
    refilled. If the drug in the prescription was no longer marked for
    Outpatient Pharmacy use, it was still possible to refill the prescription,
    which should not be allowed. This patch ensures that a drug unmarked for
    Outpatient Pharmacy use will not be refillable using this action.
 
 3. CMC-0602-30921
    National Drug Codes (NDC) starting with non-numeric characters were not
    being displayed under the "Comments" column on the CMOP Event Log section
    of the View Prescription [PSO VIEW] option. This patch corrects this issue
    by modifying the display to accommodate these National Drug Codes (NDC).
  
 4. NYH-0903-12478
    When a Health Level Seven (HL7) message is generated, the ZRL segment
    Sequence 13 (Non-Refillable), Sequence 14 (Refill Status) and Sequence
    20 (Fill Number) are not populated even though there are refills for the
    prescription. This patch will correct this issue by populating these
    Sequences for the ZRL segment.
  
 5. ISB-0203-32155
    This patch resolves compliance issues with the Standards and Conventions
    Committee's (SACC) standard regarding the documentation of Database
    Integration Agreements (DBIA).  This patch will correct this issue by
    adding this documentation.
  
 6. ISB-0903-31952
    This patch resolves compliance issues with the Standards and Conventions
    Committee's (SACC) standard regarding the format of the first line of a
    routine.  In this case, there was an extra space before the date.  This
    space has been removed to comply with the standard.
 
 7. PSO*7*152 TRACKER MESSAGE [#37406428] Response #8
    Oklahoma City reported an undefined error while testing. This patch
    corrects the undefined error encountered while setting up information
    for the Bingo Board.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  The patch should be installed when Outpatient users are NOT using the system. 
  Installation will take less than One minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*152) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*152.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
