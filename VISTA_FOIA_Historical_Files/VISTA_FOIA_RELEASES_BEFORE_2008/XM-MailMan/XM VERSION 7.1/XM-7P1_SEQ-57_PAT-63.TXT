Subject: PCTS 'NO NNNN' FAILURE FIX

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*63 is an informational patch, and replaces patch XM*7.1*60,
 which was 'entered in error'.  It is put out in response to the NOIS: 
 ISH-0295-40138 and CLE-0598-40577.
 
 This patch is only for VMS sites.
 
 PCTS can fail at VMS sites when transmitting to Austin.  PCTS can fail to 
 find "NNNN" as the message terminator and fail to receive the message.  To 
 fix it, the site must have the terminal characteristics for the outgoing 
 LAT device set to pasthru.  The command is:
 
      $ SET TERM/PERM/PASTHRU LTAxxx
 
 Make sure you spell PASTHRU with one S, because if you spell it with two, 
 it will be interpreted as PASSALL, which is another command, entirely, and 
 will interfere with flow control.
 
 This command can be issued interactively on the node(s) the taskmanager(s) 
 are running on.  This command MUST be placed in the site's local LAT system 
 startup file.  The names of these files can be different at each site, so 
 our recommendation is to place this command in the command file that sets 
 your IDCU or PRINTER characteristics.
