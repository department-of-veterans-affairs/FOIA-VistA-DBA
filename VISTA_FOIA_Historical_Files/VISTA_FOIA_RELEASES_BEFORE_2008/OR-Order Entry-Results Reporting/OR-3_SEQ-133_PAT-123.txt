Subject: Medication Order Checking Improvements

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 Problems and Issues:
 ====================
  
 1. [MWV-0600-22750, DUR-0700-30948, SBY-0101-31327, NCH-0700-40704]
 Modified code in order checking routine ORKPS that was crashing if a
 Pharmacy api returned an invalid order number.
  
 2. [BIL-0700-32575, PUG-0400-52335, AMA-1200-71187]
 Patch includes a change that prevents duplicate order check messages when
 an existing order is copied for renewal or change orders.
  
 3. [DUR-0801-32713] In cooperation with PSO*7*81 fixes a problem where 
 order checks for duplicate outpatient meds entered in the same ordering
 session did not occur. (Order checks for meds ordered in the same 
 session occur just before electronically signing the orders.)
  
 4. [CPH-1101-42139] Fixes an error when ^XTMP("ORKLOG" is undefined.
  
 5. [BHH-0102-42569] Modifications to fix a problem that prevented Lab
 Order Frequency order checks if Duplicate Order order checks were
 disabled.
  
 6. Whenever order checking code is edited to address NOIS or E3R issues, 
 it is evaluated for areas to improve performance and efficiency.  Several 
 such changes are included in this patch.
  
 7. Improvements to the data collection algorithm when the ORK DEBUG 
 ENABLE/DISABLE parameter is enabled.
