Subject: BAD ADDRESS PHARMACY ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch enhances the usage of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to
 the Registration Package V. 5.3 to check the setting of the BAD ADDRESS
 INDICATOR field (#.121) in the PATIENT file (#2) and to update the
 permanent and temporary addresses. The BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (referred to
 as BAI in this description) is one of the fields presented when using the
 API to update permanent address fields.
  
 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 options are modified to not print the 
 patient's address if a bad address is indicated and to prompt to update
 the patient's address when appropriate. If the patient has the BAD ADDRESS
 INDICATOR field set and no active temporary address, this is referred to
 as a BAI condition in this description.
  
 **********************Note**********************************************
    1. With the release of Laser Labels Phase I (PSO*7*120), dot matrix 
      label routines are no longer updated.
  
    2. Related changes for the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
      (OPAI) and Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) will be done
      in patches PSO*7*200 and PSX*2*54.
 ************************************************************************
  
  
 The following changes are made in this patch:
  
 1. A new security key PSO ADDRESS UPDATE is added. Either the EDIT 
 PATIENT DATA field (#.123) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) must be set
 to "Yes" or the user must have this new security key in order to be
 prompted to update the address (permanent and/or temporary addresses).
  
 2. When selecting a patient name in the Patient Prescription Processing 
 [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if the patient's address is flagged with
 a Bad Address Indicator, then a warning message is displayed. If the 
 EDIT PATIENT DATA is set to Yes or the user holds the new
 PSO ADDRESS UPDATE security key, he will be asked if he wants to update
 the patient's address. If there is a valid temporary address, a message to
 that effect is displayed before the prompt to update the address.
  
 Example:
   OPPATIENT,ONE (000-00-0777)
  
         WARNING: The patient address is indicated as a bad
                  address (UNDELIVERABLE).
                  * Temporary address is active *
 Do you want to update the address/phone? N// YES
 Update (P)ermanent address, (T)emporary, or (B)oth: BOTH// 
  
 3. In the Medication Profile [PSO P] option, the Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and the Complete Orders from
 OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the following changes were made:
 a. When the medication profile is displayed, the letter "B" (for bad
 address) is added to the status column if the last label activity for that
 prescription indicated a BAI condition. If the address is corrected and
 label reprinted, "B" no longer appears on the profile.
  
 Example:
  
                     Medication Profile Sorted by ISSUE DATE
                                                          REF

 b. Previously, if no ending date existed for a temporary address, the 
 fact that the address was temporary was not being displayed. This patch
 adds the temporary information including the text "(no end date)" in this
 situation. 
  
 Example:
  
 Disabilities:                                                             
      
       (Temp Address from AUG 28,2006 till (no end date))
 ADDRESS LINE1                  
 ANYTOWN                               PHONE: 555-1212
 TEXAS  
 77379                                                                    
  
  
 4. The Input Template [PSO OUTPT] is modified to remove temporary
 address update prompts. Instead, a new API to the Registration Package 
 V. 5.3 is used for updating temporary address for the Update Patient
 Record [PSO PAT] option and the Patient Record Update [PU] action (within
 the patient profile). This option and action are also changed to check for
 the user holding the PSO ADDRESS UPDATE security key or the EDIT PATIENT
 DATA field is set to "Yes" before the user is prompted to update the
 addresses.
  
 5. The following changes are made to laser label printing:
 a. If BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR is set and there is no active temporary
 address, the Mailing label prints ** BAD ADDRESS INDICATED ** and does not
 print the rest of the mailing address.
 b. An additional label log entry added for bad address indicated at the
 time the label printed.
  
 6. In the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, after the 
 prompt to display the medication profile and after the patient name and 
 social security number are shown, if the patient's address is flagged 
 with a Bad Address Indicator, a warning message is displayed. If the 
 temporary address is active, that information is displayed. The user
 will not be prompted to update the address.
  
 Example:
 Do you want to see Medication Profile? Yes// NO
  
           OPPATIENT,ONE (666-00-0777)
  
         WARNING: The patient address is indicated as a bad
                  address (UNDELIVERABLE).
                  * Temporary address is active *
  
 Press Return to continue: 
  
 7. The Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option 
 is modified to display **BAD ADDRESS INDICATED-(REASON) where REASON is 
 UNDELIVERABLE, HOMELESS, or OTHER.
  
 8. Although the Transitional Pharmacy Benefits (TPB) options have been 
 disabled, to keep the changes consistent, the routine to print TPB letters
 is modified to look at the BAI condition and print "** BAD ADDRESS
 INDICATED ** if applicable.
  
 9. The Patient Address Changes Report [PSO ADDRESS CHANGE REPORT] option 
 is modified to display additional mailing address-related fields from the
 PATIENT file (#2) and some fields related to the mail setting from the
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). The user should use FileMan to turn 
 on auditing for the following fields in order for them to be displayed 
 in this report. (Fields added to this report by this patch are indicated
 with a "*" in front of the field name).
  
 a. For the PATIENT file (#2), turn on auditing for:
  
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1] field (#.111)
 ZIP+4 field (#.1112)
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2] field (#.112)
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3] field (#.113)
 CITY field (#.114)
 STATE field (#.115)
 ZIP CODE field (#.116)
 * BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR field (#.121)
 * TEMPORARY ADDRESS ACTIVE? field (#.12105)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 1] field (#.1211)
 TEMPORARY ZIP+4 field (#.12112)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 2] field (#.1212)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 3] field (#.1213)
 TEMPORARY CITY field (#.1214)
 TEMPORARY STATE field (#.1215)
 TEMPORARY ZIP CODE field (#.1216)
 * TEMPORARY ADDRESS START DATE field (#.1217)
 * TEMPORARY ADDRESS END DATE field (#.1218)
  
 b. For the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), turn on auditing for:
 * MAIL field (#.03)
 * MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION DATE field (#.05)
  
 10. By request of a pharmacy workgroup, two new codes were added to the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) HOLD REASON field (#99):
                                 '7' FOR BAD ADDRESS; 
                                 '8' FOR PER PATIENT REQUEST; 
  
  
 11. A Bad Address Reporting Main Menu [PSO BAI REPORT] option is added 
 under the Output Reports [PSO OUTPUTS] option which includes the
 following:
 a. Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI SUSPENDED] option
 This option identifies prescriptions for veterans with a BAI Condition
 that when Printed or Pulled Early from Suspense, would be unable to be
 mailed. This gives the opportunity for the users to be proactive in trying
 to correct the address before the suspense labels print.
  
 b. List Prescriptions Not Mailed [PSO BAI NOT MAILED] option  
 This option provides a report of prescriptions with a routing of Mail that
 were not mailed due to a bad address. This is based on the last label
 activity entry being flagged as a bad address and a route other than
 "WINDOW". If the address is corrected and a label reprinted, this
 prescription would no longer show on the report.
  
 12. The View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option is changed to show Bad 
 Address Indicated if BAI flag is set and no active temporary address. 
 Example:
 VIEW PRESCRIPTION:    713449A     ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB
