Description:
============

  This patch contains changes to routines and data reported by NOIS or 
  Remedy reports or on Patch Tracking Messages for previous patches.  
  These fixes are exported separately from the regularly scheduled data 
  updates to expedite the quarterly classification system changes 
  received from the Standards Development Organizations.
  
  This patch is part of a combined build exporting changes to Code Sets. 
  The combined build is exported as a Kernel Installation and Distribution
  System (KIDS) host file named:
  
       LEX_2_32.KID    Code Set Update, FY05, 2nd Quarter
 
                       Note: There is no accompanying global host file 
                             with this patch.
  
       The combined KIDS Distribution contains three builds:
   
       LEX*2.0*32      Contains data changes and new Post-Install
       ICD*18.0*15     Contains routines ICDID and ICDAPIU
       ICPT*6.0*22     Contains routine ICPTAPIU
  
  ENHANCEMENTS
  ============
  
    This patch exports a new series of routines (LEXXFI* - File Info)to 
    be used as part of the Lexicon's Post-Install process to be used by 
    itself or with the existing post-install (LEXXST* - Status).
  
    The purpose of the new post-install routines is to assist in detecting 
    and fixing problems with the Lexicon at the sites.  Recently, a site
    had a problem with the Lexicon which was not discernable using the 
    existing post-install routines (LEXXST*).  The problem would have 
    been detected had the post-install checked the checksum of the static
    globals.  The new post-install will calculate the checksum of the 
    various Lexicon and IC* globals, check for control characters in the 
    globals, and count the total number of records for each file and 
    sub-files.
  
  NOIS/REMEDY SUMMARY
  ===================
  
     LEX*2.0*32
   
         There was a conflict between the Preferred       NOIS ISL-0904-50297
         Term and the Primary Code for codes 300.00       RT   HD0000000068241
         and 300.09.  When looking up code 300.00,
         the Lexicon would find "Anxiety state , 
         but when that term was chosen, it actually
         saved it as 300.09.  Code 300.00 was set to
         the Primary code so when looking up code 
         300.00, it will return 300.00.
   
         Lexicon term "Fibromyalgia" was incorrectly      NOIS LEB-0704-21999
         coded as ICD 729.0 and has been re-coded as      RT   HD0000000068151
         729.1.
   
         DSM-IV term "Neuroleptic-Induced Tardive         NOIS SBY-0704-30593
         Dyskinesia" with DSM code 333.82 was not         RT   HD0000000068114
         linked to an ICD code.  All DSM-IV codes         NOIS SHE-0104-50122
         are consistent with ICD-9-CM codes.  This        RT   HD0000000067834
         term has now been linked with ICD-9 code
         333.82.
   
         The spelling of "Unspecified" for ICD code       NOIS PUG-0504-51717
         428.0 has been corrected.                        RT   HD0000000068027
 
         When searching the Lexicon for "Dementia         NOIS DUR-1104-30753
         NOS" the ICD-9 code displayed is 294.8.          RT   HD0000000068409
         If you choose that term, ICD-9 code 298.9
         is saved instead of 294.8.  The PRIMARY
         FLAG in file 757.02 for codes 294.8 and 
         298.9 were reversed, returning the wrong 
         ICD code as the primary ICD code for the
         term.  ICD-9 code 294.8 is now the primary
         code for "Dementia NOS"
   
     ICD*18.0*15
    
         The ICD code V66.2 was incorrectly flagged       NOIS BOI-0804-50696
         as unacceptable as a principal diagnosis.        RT   HD0000000068179
         This has been changed so V66.2 is 
         acceptable as a principal diagnosis.
   
         During lookup, some codes display the            NOIS MIN-1104-40679
         description with the wording "(w C/C)".          RT   HD0000000068406
         This has been found to be confusing to
         the users. C/C is an abbreviation for 
         the Data Dictionary for ICD DIAGNOSIS 
         (#80) file, COMPLICATION/COMORBIDITY 
         (#70) field, and is displayed as an 
         identifier.  The "w/" is being removed 
         to reduce the confusion, changing "(w C/C)"
         to "(C/C)". (Routine ICDID)
 
         ICD codes known to be inactive appear to be      NOIS AMA-1204-71709
         active.  This was due to an error located        RT   HD0000000068588
         in the CSV/CTD API PERIOD^ICDAPIU.  A 
         similar problem also exists for CPT-4/HCPCS
         in PERIDO^ICPTAPIU.  This has been fixed by 
         exiting the loop and not reporting the last
         date found as an Activation date. (Routine
         ICDAPIU)
 
         The long description for ICD code 041.10         NOIS WPB-1204-30035
         is in error.  It states that the diagnosis       RT   HD0000000064459
         is an infection of the "STREPTOCOCCUS"
         type, but should read "STAPHYLOCOCCUS"
         instead.  The long description has been
         corrected.
   
         An extraneous node in DRG file (#80.2)           NOIS ISL-1104-50684
         has been discovered in the Lexicon's             RT   HD0000000064394
         development accounts and at some production 
         accounts which is not supported by the Data 
         Dictionary.  This extraneous node is 
         located at ^ICD(D0,2).  If this node is 
         found, it will be deleted.
  
     ICPT*6.0*22
  
         CPT codes known to be inactive appear to be      NOIS AMA-1204-71709
         active.  This was due to an error located        RT   HD0000000068588
         in the CSV/CTD API PERIOD^ICPTAPIU.  A 
         similar problem also exists for ICD-9 in 
         PERIDO^ICDAPIU.  This has been fixed by 
         exiting the loop and not reporting the last
         date found as an Activation date. (Routine
         ICPTAPIU)
