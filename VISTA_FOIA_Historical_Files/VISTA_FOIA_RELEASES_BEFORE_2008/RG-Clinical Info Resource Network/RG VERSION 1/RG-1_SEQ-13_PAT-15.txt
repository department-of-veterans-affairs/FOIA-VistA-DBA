Subject: MPI/PD-CPRS REMOTE DATA VIEWS CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*14 is a required build for patch RG*1*15.
   
  Patches RG*1*14 and RG*1*15 should be installed together.  RG*1*14
  brings in the routine and data dictionary changes needed by RG*1*15.
   
  The goal of the CPRS REMOTE DATA VIEWS project is to utilize
  Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and Master
  Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) to retrieve a list of facilities at which
  a patient has been seen.  Using the CPRS Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  Reports Tab, the user may select the report they would like to see and
  the site from which they would like to retrieve the report.
   
  In VistA, ancillary packages pass clinic workload data to the Patient
  Care Encounter (PCE) software.  This clinic workload data eventually
  gets filed in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file with a status of
  CHECKED OUT.  These clinics are defined as "count" clinics.
  Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Laboratory and Surgery software passes
  clinic workload information to PCE.  It is for these applications,
  Radiology/Nuclear Medicine, Laboratory and Surgery that data is not
  being tracked.  Subsequently, the CPRS REMOTE PATIENT DATA VIEWS
  software cannot examine these patient events.
   
  This patch exports the routines necessary to build and deliver Health
  Level Seven (HL7) messages that compare data from the DATE (#.01) field
  in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file against the DATE LAST
  TREATED (#.03) field in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
  If the value of DATE from the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file is
  greater than the value of the DATE LAST TREATED (#.03) field in the
  TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file, the most recent date is
  transmitted in a Treating Facility Update message.  This patch, in
  conjunction with RG*1.0*14, resolves issues reported in NOIS WRJ-1200
  -10722 and MAC-0101-61732.

  Post-Install Routine RGI15PST:
  ==============================
  The Post-Install routine, RGI15PST, compares the value in the DATE LAST
  TREATED (#.03) field in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file
  against the DATE (#.01) field value in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER
  (#409.68) file.  If the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file has a
  DATE for an encounter with a status of CHECKED OUT that is later than
  the DATE LAST TREATED value stored in the TREATING FACILITY LIST
  (#391.91) file, the later date is sent out to all the facilities that
  share the patient.  This updates the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91)
  file, and provides data consistency throughout VistA.
   
  The Post-Install utilizes checkpoints to store off which patient
  records have been compared successfully.  In case of an error,
  the job can be re-started at the record following the last patient
  successfully compared.
   
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
   
      **CAUTION**   Carefully read the following instructions
                    before installing this patch.
      
  NOTE:  Sites that have Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient
  Demographics/Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0 installed AND have
  had your patients loaded to the Master Patient Index:
      Because the installation of this patch immediately tasks off the 
      data compare process, it is recommended that you queue the 
      installation to begin during the off-hours.  The comparison
      process examines all active patients who have a national
      Integration Control Number (ICN), and subsequently examines data
      in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file for those patients.
      This process may take a long time to run and should be queued
      to begin during the off-hours or over a weekend.
   
      The actual time required to complete the data comparison process
      at the test sites is shown below.
      Facility                     Active ICNs       Total Process Time
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      Boston HCS                      140,333        6 hours 26 minutes
      Connecticut HCS                  98,279        2 hours 41 minutes
      Manchester, NH                   38,820                50 minutes
      White River Junction, VT         34,443                46 minutes
   
  NOTE:  Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics/
  Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0 sites that HAVE NOT had your 
  patients loaded to the Master Patient Index:
      The data compare process as detailed above does NOT take place as a
      separate process.  The data comparison is incorporated into the load
      to the MPI, thus cutting down on messaging.
   
  Users may be on the system during installation of this patch. 
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
    
  2.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
     
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*15).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*15.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
  8.  It is recommended that the installation be queued to begin during
      the off-hours.
           Enter the Device you want to print the Install messages.
           You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device prompt.
           Enter a '^' to abort the install.
           
           DEVICE: HOME//Q             << Enter Q.
           DEVICE:                     << Select a device.
           Request Start Time:  NOW//  << Enter date/time as suggested in
                                          the installation instructions.
   
  9.  Routine RGI15PST can be deleted from your system after successful
      completion of the comparison process.  When the process finishes,
      the installer and the CIRN EXCEPTION MGT mail group on FORUM will
      receive the following message.
      Subj: MPI/PD-determine the correct DATE LAST TREATED
      From: POSTMASTER (Sender: INSTALLING USER,NAME)
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      Data compare between the DATE field in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER
      (#409.68) file and the DATE LAST TREATED field in the TREATING
      FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file
      process start time: Feb 07, 2001 5:40 pm
      process completion time: Feb 08, 2001 0:06 am
   
      # of processed patients, in the PATIENT (#2) file with
      an ICN: 140333
      # of processed patients, in the PATIENT (#2) file with
      a non-local ICN: 114387
      
      In the event that the comparison process is stopped by the installer,
      that individual is notified by an E-Mail message stating that the
      task has been stopped.  The software utilizes checkpoints so the
      process can be restarted using the Restart Install of Package(s)
      [XPD RESTART INSTALL] option on the Kernel Installation and
      Distribution System (KIDS) Installation [XPD INSTALLATION MENU] menu.
