Subject: UPDATED DOCUMENTATION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

  This is an informational patch, serving two purposes.
 
  The first is that sites were previously informed that NT 4.0 was an
  acceptable operating system for the VSS Kiosk.  It has been found that
  NT 4.0 is not an acceptable operating system for the VSS Kiosk.
 
  The second purpose is to inform the sites of corrections to Voluntary
  Time Keeping documentation. These documents are part of the new Voluntary
  Service System migration.  The following documents have been updated:
          VSS Site Installation Guide
          VSS Technical Guide
          VSS User Manual
 
  These documents were first referenced in patch ABSV*4.0*32.  They are
  available from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the IO Field
  Offices.
