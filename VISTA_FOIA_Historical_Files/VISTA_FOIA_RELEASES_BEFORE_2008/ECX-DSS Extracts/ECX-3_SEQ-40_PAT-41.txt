Subject: CORRECTIONS TO MOV AND SUR EXTRACTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 I. NOIS ISSUES
    ===========
  
  1) This patch will correct the way DSS encounter numbers are created in 
     the MOV (Transfer and Discharge) Extract for patients who are
     transferred via an Absent Sick in Hospital (ASIH) admission with an
     observation treating specialty.  Currently, encounter numbers for MOV
     extract records for the transfer to/from ASIH are based on the
     treating specialty assigned within the ASIH admission.  However, these
     movements are actually part of the still active "before ASIH"
     admission to long term care and not the ASIH admission. If the ASIH
     admission contains an observation treating specialty, an outpatient
     encounter number is created which is not representative of the active
     long term care admission.
     After this patch is installed, the encounter numbers for the transfer
     to and from ASIH movement types will match the active long term care
     admission. 
    
     This was reported in NOIS OTH-0102-N3035.
  
  
 2)  The encounter number for the SUR extract has been modified to use the 
     DSS STOP CODE field (#3) of the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44)
     instead of the DSS UNIT IDENTIFIER field (#8) previously used for 
     outpatient surgeries. This will more accurately reflect the stop code
     for the clinic as determined by DSS.
     
     This was reported in NOIS PAL-0102-62487.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
   DSS Extract users to prevent the use of options until installation has
   been completed.
     
   If you are running the install interactively and not rebuilding user 
   menus, installation will take less than 2 minutes. 
     
   Note:  If you are not running the installation interactively and intend
          to allow KIDS to start the rebuild of user menus upon completion
          of the install, then please queue the install for a period of
          low system activity.
     
   No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
   more than once.
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
      
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu. (Skip this step if already in the 
       Installation menu)
      
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*41):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
      
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*41.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
       ECX MAINTENANCE       Maintenance
  
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
