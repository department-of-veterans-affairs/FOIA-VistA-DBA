Subject: G&L SHEET (MT COPAY APPLICABILITY) CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Geographic Means Tests was introduced changing the naming conventions of
 Category A and Category C Means Tests. This patch will update the Gains
 and Losses (G&L) Sheet [DG G&L SHEET] with modifications needed to conform
 to these changes in the display of Means Test status.
  
 Changes will include the following:
 -----------------------------------
  
 1.  The legend displaying Means Test status for patients in the 'Gains and
     Losses (G&L) Sheet' [DG G&L SHEET] option will replace Category 'A'
     Veteran with MT Copay Exempt; replace Category 'C' Veteran with MT
     Copay Required; add GMT Copay Required.  Patients with a Pending
     Adjudication Means Test status will display whether the pending
     adjudication is for MT Copay Required or GMT Copay Required, with the
     latter determination being displayed on the G&L Sheet.
  
 2.  Title of 'Means Test Indicator's' under the parameters display of the
     'Gains and Losses (G&L) Sheet' option will be replaced with 'Means
     Test Copay Applicability'.
  
 3.  Title of 'Means Test Display' under the parameters display of the 'G&L
     Parameter Edit' [DGPM G&L PARAMETER EDIT] option will be replaced with
     'Means Test Copay Applicability Display'.

 ------------------------------------------
 There are no E3R(s) associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
 -------------------------------------------------
 MAD-0103-41926       GMT COPAY REQUIRED NOT DISPLAY ON G&L
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 MAD-0103-41926       GMT COPAY REQUIRED NOT DISPLAY ON G&L
  
 Problem:  
 --------
 MT Copay Required was still showing on the G&L Sheet as Cat C but the GMT
 Copay Required was not displaying.  This led the site to believe they were
 treating a SC patient.
  
 Resolution:  
 -----------
 The legend when displaying Means Test was updated to conform to the
 Geographic Means Test statuses.  GMT Copay Required was added as one of
 the edit checks when displaying the legend along side of the patient
 listed under the G&L Sheet. Titles for Means Test under the parameters
 display have been updated to include 'Copay Applicability' in its
 description.
