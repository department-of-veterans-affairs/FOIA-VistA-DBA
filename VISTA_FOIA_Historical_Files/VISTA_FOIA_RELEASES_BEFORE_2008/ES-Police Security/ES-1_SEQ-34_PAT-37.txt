Description:

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
 1. BIR-0700-31302    UNABLE TO MAKE ENTRIES USING YESTERDAY'S DATE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was discovered that personnel could inadvertantly change the date
    of the journal in the ESP DAILY JOURNAL (#916) file.  This can be caused
    by entering a time entry (ie, 0748) at the date prompt while using the
    option Create a Daily Journal [ESP CREATE JOURNAL].  The system would
    assume the first two numbers were the month and the last two numbers
    were the year (ie, July 1948).  This caused inaccurate dates to be
    entered into the ESP DAILY JOURNAL (#916) file which caused the
    personnel to be unable to find the correct journal date to log entries
    to while using the Add a Journal Entry [ESP ADD JOURNAL ENTRY] option.
  
    It was also noticed that the FROM (#1) and TO (#2) fields in the ESP
    DAILY JOURNAL (#916) file would allow any valid date entry as well,
    independent of the date stored in the DATE (.01) field. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the routine ESPCRJO and input transform of the DATE (#.01) 
    field in the ESP DAILY JOURNAL (#916) file to not allow hhmm to be 
    entered.
  
    Also modified the input transforms for the FROM (#1) and TO (#2) fields
    in the ESP DAILY JOURNAL (#916) file.  The month and year for these
    entries will be checked against the month and year of the system (DT)
    date field to reduce the chance of inadvertantly entering dates that
    are not appropriate.

        for the routine listed in the Routine Summary.
   
        NOTE:  If the routine included in this patch is not currently
        in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
   3.   Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
        [XPD MAIN]: 
    
             Edits and Distribution ...
