Subject: Issues Regarding Disassociate Results

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects issues related to the disassociation of clinical results 
 from a Consult.
 
 1) The disassociation of an unsigned clinical results document (a TIU 
 Document) was sending the "Disassoc Result" alert message.  This alert is 
 undesired because the unsigned document did not alert users to its presence 
 when written.
 
 2) The status of a Consult was incorrectly being changed to ACTIVE in the 
 following scenario:
        a. The Consult is Administratively Completed
        b. Then a clinical results document is created but left unsigned
        c. Finally, the clinical results document is deleted (disassociated)
 At this point the status should be left COMPLETED instead of being changed 
 back to ACTIVE
 
 3) The status of a Consult was incorrectly being changed to ACTIVE in the 
 following scenario:
        a. The Consult has the Scheduled action performed
        b. Then a clinical results document is created but left unsigned
        c. Finally, the clinical results document is deleted (disassociated)
 At this point the status should be changed back to SCHEDULED instead of 
 ACTIVE.
