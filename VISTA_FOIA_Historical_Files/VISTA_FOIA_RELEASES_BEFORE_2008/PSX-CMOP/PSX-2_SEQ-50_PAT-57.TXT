Subject: MISSING CMOP MULTIPLES AND ERROR WHEN SITE ADDRESS IS MISSING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Missing CMOP Multiples in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and an error in
 routine PSXERR when the site street address is missing.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================
 CMM-0604-N0433 - HD68047
 CMM-0804-N1575 - HD68214
 NOL-0804-71957 - HD68226
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Ann Arbor, MI
 Battle Creek, MI
 Detroit, MI
 Iron Mountain, MI
 New Orleans, LA
 New York HCS
 Roseburg, OR
 Saginaw, MI
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 CMM-0604-N1575 AND CMM-0804-N1575
  
 The CMOP Event Multiple is not being set up in some cases.
 This error cannot be duplicated.  Two things were changed to try and 
 resolve this issue.  There was a lock on file the PRESCRIPTION file (#52),
 CMOP Event multiple field (#400) in the routine that sets up the multiple.
 The routine is also using ^XTMP("ORLK" while updating this field so the
 lock on the CMOP event in PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is not necessary. No
 Class I software was found that would cause a problem with the lock of the
 CMOP event in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
 Errors are captured in ^XTMP("PSXERR" in addition to the regular error 
 trap.  This file was being kept for 2 days and was always purged before 
 problems surfaced.  This file will now be kept for 12 days in an attempt 
 to find the problem. 
  
 NOL-0804-71957
  
 When a site street address was missing, a mail message was being sent 
 describing the problem but the CMOP transmission received an error.
 This patch will correct this error.

 This patch is exported using KIDS.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 ***********************************************************************
 NOTE: This patch cannot be loaded while a CMOP transmission is running.
 ***********************************************************************
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSX*2.0*57):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
  
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSX*2.0*57.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options 
     you would like to place out of order, enter the following
  
               SUSPENSE FUNCTIONS   PSO PND     SUSPENSE Functions
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
     you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
