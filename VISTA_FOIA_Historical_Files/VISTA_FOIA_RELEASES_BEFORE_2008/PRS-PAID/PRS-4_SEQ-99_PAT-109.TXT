 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
  
 1.   HD61409        Labor Distribution Audit Error
          
      Problem:
      --------
      An error is generated when the user enters a device
      in the Labor Distribution Audit option.
  
      Resolution
      ----------
      PRSALDA has been corrected to not error when a device
      is entered in the Labor Distribution Audit [PRSA LD 
      AUDIT] option.
  
 2.   HD150492       Paid errors due to system shutdown
  
      Problem:
      --------
      When a system shutdown occurs while the PRSDPROC routine is
      running, it causes entries to remain in ^XTMP("PRS",SUB,DATE).
      When the system starts back up, the PRSDPROC routine will
      begin automatically and an error occurs. The <undefined> error
      occurs at LDCMP+5^PRSDSERV because the entry point accessed
      with automatic startup does not set the variable TIME.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      The routine PRSDPROC has been updated to set the variable
      TIME at the PROC entry point.
  
 3.   HD94658        Military Leave problem
  
      Problem:
      --------
      The employee was not charged with enough military leave. 
      Employee had Authorized Absence the week following
      military leave. When meal time was subtracted from 
      the posting of authorized absence, the meal time was
      also incorrectly subtracted from Military Leave.
  
      Resolution
      ----------
      Corrected PRS8MT to not subtract meal time from military
      leave time when authorized absence is present also.
  
  
 4.   HD96653   Leave Charge Problem-Meal Time
  
      Problem:
      -------
      Meal time is incorrectly being deducted from 
      annual leave segments of time.
  
      Resolution
      ----------
      Corrected PRS8MT so that meal time will not be taken
      from leave time segments.
