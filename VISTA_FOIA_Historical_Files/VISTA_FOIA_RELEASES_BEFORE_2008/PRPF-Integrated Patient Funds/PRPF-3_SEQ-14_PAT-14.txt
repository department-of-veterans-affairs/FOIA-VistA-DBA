 1. CTX-0802-72531 (Patient Funds Problem)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user selects either the Balance Check [PRPF BALANCE CHECK] or Post 
 Patient Funds Transaction [PRPF POST] option an error is generated and

 Resolution:

 Modify routine PRPFBAL to correctly process a patient record from file 
 PATIENT FUNDS (#470), that has a null in field STATION NAME (#73).
  
 In addition, the SCHEDULING RECOMMENDED (#209) field, for the menu
 option Patient Summary Report [PRPF PATIENT SUMMARY] is incorrectly set 
 in file OPTION (#19) to YES and will be changed to NO.
