Subject: REMOVE INCOME TEST INCONSISTENCY MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch along with related patch IVM*2.0*107 Remove Income Test
 Inconsistency Messages addresses the Income Test Inconsistency Messages
 that are generated when either completing or editing a completed Income
 Test. The data inconsistency messages are stored in the COMMENTS #50 field
 of the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 file. PLEASE NOTE:  these are not related
 to the messages that you get through data entry in Registration. The only
 time the Income Test Inconsistency Messages are applied is when a user is
 completing a Means Test or receiving an upload of a Means Test.
  
 Many improvements have been made to the DG MEANS TEST and DG CO-PAY 
 TEST options and it is no longer possible to cause a great many of the
 original 111 data inconsistencies, thus rendering the associated messages
 obsolete. Below is an illustrative example.
  
 Example: After entering a dependent's sex, you can only select a
          relationship that is appropriate for that sex.  When the 
          dependent is a male, you can only enter a relationship of SON, 
          STEPSON, NEPHEW, etc.  The inconsistency message stating that 
          dependent relationship/sex are inconsistent is now invalid.
  
 There have also been changes to the business rules for Income Tests that
 render some of the Inconsistency Messages obsolete. An example of this 
 follows.
  
 Example: If you are divorced and paying child support you are able to 
          count your children as dependents. The inconsistency message 
          stating that the children must be living with you is now 
          invalid.
  
 In fact, research has determined that of the original 111 Income Test 
 Inconsistency Messages, only 17 are still valid and correct. The 
 remaining 94 inconsistency messages have either been rendered obsolete or 
 invalid since Means Test Sharing was released in October 1999. All 94 of 
 these inconsistency messages are being removed with these two patches.
  
 There are two types of conditions that cause the 17 inconsistency messages
 that are not being removed:  (1) data entry omissions or mistakes, and (2)
 erroneous or corrupted data filed in the records.  Four of the messages
 this patch focuses on are of type (1), and the other 13 are of type (2).
        
 IMPORTANT NOTE:  Only the Primary site for the Income Test can correct 
 the inconsistent data.  
  
 Below is a complete list of inconsistency messages that are still in use, 
 followed by the actions necessary to resolve them. This patch along with 
 IVM*2.0*107 removes the 94 obsolete inconsistency messages described 
 above, but does not change anything remaining in this list. The list is 
 included in this patch text as a convenient, quick reference.
  
 There is a known issue with the Threshold/Test Determined Calculator, 
 occasionally causing the value to be wrong for edited Income Tests. This 
 has consequences for the resolution of the last six of the inconsistency 
 messages, #12-17 below.  Simply stepping through and re-completing the 
 test will cause the calculator to re-evaluate and update the values 
 correctly.  This issue with the Threshold/Test Determined Calculator will 
 be addressed in a subsequent patch yet to be determined.
  
  
 INCONSISTENCY MESSAGES CAUSED BY DATA ENTRY OMISSIONS OR MISTAKES
 =================================================================
  
 1. Dependent (<dependent type>) transmitted without SSN
 -------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when a dependent is added to an Income Test 
 without entering the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. The dependent's relationship 
 is displayed in the message to facilitate its update.
  
     Examples: Dependent (SON) transmitted without SSN
               Dependent (DAUGHTER) transmitted without SSN
               Dependent (STEPDAUGHTER) transmitted without SSN
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Using the appropriate menu option, Edit an Existing Means Test [DG
 MEANS TEST EDIT] or Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG CO-PAY TEST
 EDIT], go to the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1). Use the Dependent 
 Demographic (DD) action, and enter the social security number for the 
 dependent who generated the inconsistency message, and then re-complete 
 the test.
  
 2. Two dependents transmitted with same SSN
 -------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the data values in the SOCIAL SECURITY
 NUMBER field (#.09) in the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13) for at least two
 dependents are identical.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Using the appropriate menu option, Edit an Existing Means Test [DG
 MEANS TEST EDIT] or Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG CO-PAY TEST
 EDIT], go to the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1). Use the Dependent 
 Demographic (DD) action, and check the social security number for each of 
 the dependents listed on the test. Update the invalid social security 
 number for the dependent who generated the inconsistency message, and 
 then re-complete the test.
  
 3. Shouldn't have income data if Child Had Income is NO
 -------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the dependent is not the spouse, the 
 INCOME AVAILABLE TO YOU field (#.12) in the INCOME RELATION file 
 (#408.22) is No, and any of the income or net worth fields in the 
 INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME file (#408.21) for the dependent contain any 
 amount. Any entry including a zero ($0) is valid.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When the INCOME AVAILABLE TO YOU field is set to No, and there are income 
 and net worth entries for the dependent, the amounts are not visible on 
 either the INCOME or NET WORTH screens.  
  
 Using the appropriate menu option, Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS
 TEST EDIT] or Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG CO-PAY TEST
 EDIT], go to the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1).  Use the Dependent
 Demographic (DD) action, and change the INCOME AVAILABLE TO YOU field to 
 YES. Go to the GROSS INCOME (#2) and NET WORTH (#4) screens and delete 
 the amounts entered for the dependent. Next go back to the MARITAL 
 STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1), and using the Dependent Demographic (DD) 
 action, change the INCOME AVAILABLE TO YOU field back to NO, and then 
 re-complete the test.
  
 4. No income data allowed if spouse didn't live w/vet & amt contributed
    <$600
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the data value in the record in the INCOME
 RELATION #408.22 file LIVED WITH PATIENT #.06 field is "NO" and the AMOUNT
 CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE #.07 field is less than $600, and any of the income
 or net worth fields in the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME #408.21 file for the
 spouse contain any amount. Any entry including a zero ($0) is valid.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When the LIVED WITH PATIENT field is set to No, and the AMOUNT 
 CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE field is less than $600, and there are income and 
 net worth entries for the dependent, the amounts are not visible on 
 either the INCOME or NET WORTH screens. Using the appropriate menu 
 option, Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS TEST EDIT] or Edit an 
 Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG CO-PAY TEST EDIT], go to the MARITAL
 STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1). Use the Marital/Dependent Info (MT)
 action, and change the LIVED WITH PATIENT to YES. Go to the GROSS INCOME
 (#2) and NET WORTH (#4) screens and delete the amounts entered for the
 spouse. Next go back to the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS SCREEN (#1), and
 using the Marital/Dependent Info (MT) action, change the LIVED WITH
 PATIENT to NO, and then re-complete the test.
  
  
 INCONSISTENCY MESSAGES CAUSED BY ERRONEOUS OR CORRUPTED DATA 
 ============================================================
  
 Inconsistency checks #5-9 below are performed for Means Tests and Copay
 Exemption Tests when one or more of the following fields in the ANNUAL
 MEANS TEST #408.31 file contains inconsistent data:
         o  HARDSHIP?                Field #.2
         o  HARDSHIP REVIEW DATE     Field #.21
         o  SITE GRANTING HARDSHIP   Field #2.04
         o  HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE  Field #2.01
  
 5. Missing Hardship Indicator
 -----------------------------
 This message is returned when the Hardship Indicator, HARDSHIP? #.2
 field is NULL, and at least one of the other Hardship-related fields
 contains data. 
  
 6. Missing Site Granting Hardship
 ---------------------------------
 This message is returned when the SITE GRANTING HARDSHIP #2.04 field is
 NULL, and at least one of the other Hardship-related fields contains data.
  
 7. Missing Hardship Effective Date
 ----------------------------------
 This message is returned when the HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE #2.01 field 
 is NULL, the year in the DATE OF TEST #.01 field is the year 2000 or 
 later, and at least one of the other Hardship-related fields contains 
 data. Starting in the year 2000, all hardships must have an effective 
 date.
  
 Resolution to #5, 6, 7:
 ----------------------
 If any of the following three fields has an entry, all three must be 
 entered: HARDSHIP?, SITE GRANTING HARDSHIP, and HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE.
 The HARDSHIP REVIEW DATE field is not a part of the criteria for this 
 inconsistency message.
  
 Using the Hardships [DGMTH HARDSHIPS] option, edit the veteran's record on
 the Hardship Determinations Screen (#1). Use the Edit Hardship (EH)
 action, and enter the missing data.
  
 8. Invalid Hardship Effective Date
 ----------------------------------
 This message is returned when the date in the HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE 
 #2.01 field could not be converted into FileMan format, and at
 least one of the other Hardship-related fields contains data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Using the Hardships [DGMTH
 HARDSHIPS] option, edit the veteran's record on the
 Hardship Determinations Screen (#1). Use the Edit Hardship (EH) action, 
 and either enter (if NULL) or re-enter the HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE.
  
 9. Hardship Effective Date earlier than Means Test Date
 -------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE #2.01 field 
 is not NULL and the date is prior to the date in the DATE OF TEST #.01 
 field in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 file, and at least one of the 
 other Hardship-related fields contains data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Using the Hardships [DGMTH HARDSHIPS] option, edit the veteran's record on
 the Hardship Determinations Screen (#1). Use the Edit Hardship (EH)
 action, and enter a date for the HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE that is no
 earlier than the effective date of the Means Test. At least one of the
 other related Hardship fields (HARDSHIP?, SITE GRANTING HARDSHIP, or
 HARDSHIP EFFECTIVE DATE) is also missing and must be entered to remove
 this inconsistency.
  
 10. Source of Test must be identified
 -------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 
 file meets the following criteria:
     The SOURCE OF INCOME TEST #.23 field does not contain one of the 
     following values found in the SOURCE OF INCOME TEST #408.34 file:
     VAMC (#1), IVM (#2), DCD (#3), or OTHER FACILITY (#4).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Means Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Means Test. Using the Edit an Existing 
 Means Test [DG MEANS TEST EDIT] option, view the data on each of the Means
 Test screens, press <Enter>, and then re-complete the test.
  
 11. Site Conducting Test must be identified
 -------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31
 file meets the following criteria:
     The SITE CONDUCTING TEST #2.05 field is NULL and the SOURCE OF
     INCOME TEST #.23 field is OTHER FACILITY.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Because your site is not the site that entered the Income Test, you cannot
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Income Test.
  
 12. Incorrect Means Test Status for Test-Determined Status
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31
 file meets the following criteria:
     The INCOME #.04 field is greater than the THRESHOLD A #.12 field,
     and the HARDSHIP? #.2 field is "NO" or NULL, and the ADJUDICATION
     DATE/TIME #.1 field is NULL, and the TEST-DETERMINED STATUS #2.03
     field is neither MT COPAY REQUIRED ("C") nor PENDING 
     ADJUDICATION ("P").
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Means Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Means Test. If the Means Test was entered at 
 your site, then, using the Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS TEST 
 EDIT] option, view the data on each of the Income Test screens, press
 <Enter>, and then re-complete the test.
  
 13. Invalid Means Test Status for Test-Determined Status
 --------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31
 file meets the following criteria:
     The TEST-DETERMINED STATUS #2.03 field does not contain a valid
     value (e.g. MT COPAY EXEMPT ("A"), MT COPAY REQUIRED ("C"), "PENDING 
     ADJUDICATION ("P"), or GMT COPAY REQUIRED ("G"). This is caused when
     there is an error in the calculation of the Test-Determined Status due
     to corruption in the Means Test data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Means Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Means Test. If the Means Test was entered at 
 your site, then, using the Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS TEST 
 EDIT] option, view the data on each of the Income Test screens, press
 <Enter>, and then re-complete the test.
  
 14. Income plus net worth not greater than threshold value-incorrect
     status
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 
 file meets the following criteria:
     The INCOME #.04 field is not greater than the THRESHOLD A #.12 
     field, and the NET WORTH #.05 field added to the INCOME is not 
     greater than the THRESHOLD, and the TEST-DETERMINED STATUS #2.03 
     field is MT COPAY REQUIRED ("C").
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Means Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Means Test. If the Means Test was entered at 
 your site, then, using the Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS TEST 
 EDIT] option, view the data on each of the Income Test screens, press
 <Enter>, and then re-complete the test.
  
 15. Copay Test Status should be <calculated status>
 ---------------------------------------------------
 The Copay Exemption Status is calculated based on income and net worth, 
 and then compared to the TEST-DETERMINED STATUS #2.03 field in the 
 ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 file. This message is returned when the 
 calculated status does not equal the TEST-DETERMINED STATUS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Co-Pay Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Co-Pay Test.
  
 Using the Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG CO-PAY TEST EDIT]
 option, view the data on each of the Income Test screens, press <Enter>,
 and then re-complete the test.
  
 16. Invalid Copay Test Status for Test-Determined Status
 --------------------------------------------------------
 This message is returned when the record in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST #408.31 
 file meets the following criteria:
     The TEST-DETERMINED STATUS #2.03 field is not one of the following: 
     EXEMPT ("E"), or NON-EXEMPT ("M").
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When your site is not the site that entered the Co-Pay Test, you cannot 
 correct this data inconsistency. It can only be corrected at the site 
 that entered/completed this Co-Pay Test. If the Means Test was entered at 
 your site, then, using the Edit an Existing Copay Exemption Test [DG
 CO-PAY TEST EDIT] option, view the data on each of the Income Test
 screens, press <Enter>, and then re-complete the test.
  
 17. Income does not exceed child exclusion amount-educational expense not 
     allowed
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION #17 field in the MEANS TEST DATA #43.03
 sub-file of the MAS PARAMETERS #43 file is used for this inconsistency
 check. The other two fields, EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES #1.03 field and TOTAL 
 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT #.14 field are found in the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL 
 INCOME #408.21 file for the dependent.
  
 This message is returned when the dependent is not the spouse, the 
 EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES field has an amount, and the CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION
 for the Income Year is not less than the TOTAL INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The normal processing of the Post-Secondary Education Expenses for a 
 child between the ages of 18 and 23, are if the TOTAL INCOME FROM 
 EMPLOYMENT is above the CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION threshold found in the MAS 
 PARAMETERS #43 file, the expenses can be entered.  When the income amount
 is modified to be below this threshold, the EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES are
 deleted from the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME record for the child.
  
 This message will only be displayed when the Means Test process failed to 
 delete the EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES from the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME record 
 for the child. Using the Edit an Existing Means Test [DG MEANS TEST EDIT]
 option, view the data on each of the Income Test screens, press <Enter>,
 and then re-complete the test.

 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------
  
      Issue: Requesting documentation update DG*5.3*463/IVM*2*71.
  
    Problem: The documentation contained tables of potential errors, based
             on a file of differing error messages VistA users may possibly
             see; however, it does not provide the VistA sites specific 
             guidance in terms of error correction.  
  
 Resolution: The majority of the messages are now invalid or obsolete, and 
             are being removed with patch IVM*2.0*107.  This patch will 
             document the resolution of the issues for the remaining 
             messages.
  
      Issue: Receiving inconsistency error in IVM VistA
  
    Problem: When attempting to enter the veteran as Married but not 
             living together, the site is receiving an inconsistency
             error.  
  
 Resolution: This inconsistency message is obsolete, and is being removed 
             with this patch.
  
      Issue: MEANS TEST DEPENDENTS
  
    Problem: There are situations whereby the couples separate but have not
             yet divorced or file taxes together, and an inconsistency 
             message is received (Must have Living with Patient if 
             Married).
  
 Resolution: This inconsistency message is obsolete, and is being removed
             with this patch.
