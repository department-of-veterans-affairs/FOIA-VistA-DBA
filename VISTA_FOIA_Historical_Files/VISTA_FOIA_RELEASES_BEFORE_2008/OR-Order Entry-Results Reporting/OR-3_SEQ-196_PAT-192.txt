Subject: BCMA MAH REPORT FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch corrects a problem found when printing the BCMA Medication
  History report from the CPRS Reports Tab.  In a previous patch a 
  parameter was added to this report to limit it to a maximum number
  of days back to 7 days.  We found that this parameter was not being
  used if the user selected to print the report to a Windows printer.
  This same path was leaving a temporary global set in the ^TMP("PSBO"
  subscript.  This may explain why some sites have reported file full
  or disk full errors, because of the size of the ^TMP global.  As part
  of this patch the following ^TMP global will be cleaned up:
      ^TMP("PSBO")
  Because these globals are used by BCMA Reports, users of BCMA and
  CPRS should either be off the system or at a minimum when this patch
  is installed.
