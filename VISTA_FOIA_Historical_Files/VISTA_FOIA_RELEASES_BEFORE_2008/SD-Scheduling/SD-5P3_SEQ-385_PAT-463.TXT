Subject: FIX FUTURE CLINIC AVAILABILITY DISPLAY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses an issue with displaying future availability when 
 choosing multiple clinics where one of the clinics has a future start 
 date. It also tightens up the rules for creating the availability nodes 
 in the Hospital Location file.
    
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ==================
 HD117503 - Clinic Availability Display problem after Patch SD*5.3*383
  
 Duplicate:  HD128837 - Reporting as a duplicate of #117503
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Northport VAMC
 Tampa VAMC
 North Texas HCS
 Pittsburgh HCS
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 Problem:
 --------
 1) When running the DISPLAY CLINIC AVAILABILITY REPORT, if the user
 chooses multiple clinics where one of the clinics has a future start date,
 the lookup start date gets reset to the first available day of the future
 clinic.
  
 2) In fixing the incorrect creation of "ST" availability nodes in the 
 Hospital Location file the creation function had been removed entirely.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 1) Don't allow the start date variable to get reset.
  
 2) Allow new "ST" availability nodes to be created by this report - but 
 limit the circumstances where the report is allowed to create these 
 nodes. In order for an availability node to be created, the date being 
 evaluated must:
         1 - have an "indefinite" pattern set up via the "SET UP A CLINIC"
             option.
         2 - already have an "ST" node in existence. 
         3 - be equal to or greater than the earliest existing "ST" node.
         4 - not be in the past.

       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
