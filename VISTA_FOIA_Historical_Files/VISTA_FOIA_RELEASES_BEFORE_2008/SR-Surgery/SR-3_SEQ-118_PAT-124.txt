Subject: ERROR IN THE SR OPERATIONS REPORT

Category:

Description:
============

 the Operations menu option, a null subscript error is generated.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 SBY-0803-30168  ERROR - IM+2^SROPRPT
  
 Problem: The Cumulative Report of CPT Codes option [SROACCT] left  
          the variable SRTN defined (SRTN="").  When the user then
          goes to the Operation Menu, they are not prompted to
          select a patient and an operation because SRTN was
          already defined.
  
 Resolution: The routine SROACCT has been updated at END+2
             to kill the local variable SRTN upon finishing.
