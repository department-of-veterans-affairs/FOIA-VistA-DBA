Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This project consists of a set of patches that work together to create a new
 Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
 rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
 finding types are included in the index.
  
 The patches that comprise this project are:
  
  PXRM*1.5*12
  DG*5.3*478
  GMPL*2*27
  GMRV*5*6
  LR*5.2*295
  OR*3*157
  PSJ*5.0*90
  PSO*7*118
  PSS*1.0*62
  PSS*1.0*89
  PX*1.0*119
  RA*5*33
  YS*5.01*77
 
 Note that PSJ*5.0*90 and PSS*1.0*62 have already been released and are not 
 included in the multi-package build.
  
 This patch (PXRM*1.5*12) creates the Clinical Reminder utilities used to
 populate and manage the index. 
 
 Note: This patch is informational; there are no routines to unpack.
 The build itself (PXRM*1.5*12) is distributed as part of a multi-package 
 build.
  
 Host File:
 ==========
 This build is being distributed as part of a multi-package build so it will 
 only be available as a host file. The name of the host file is:
 CLINICAL_REMINDERS_INDEX.KID.
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses. The
 preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov. This
 transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
 
 This file must be obtained in ASCII mode.
  
 Documentation:
 ==============
 An installation guide, PXRM_1_5_12_IG.PDF, and a technical manual,
 PXRM_1_5_12_TM.PDF, will be distributed with this patch. This documentation
 will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files. 
 
 Again, the preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
 may also elect to retrieve documents directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
 
 These files MUST be obtained in BINARY mode.
  
 The documentation can also be found on the Health System Design and
 Development Web page: (http://vista.med.va.gov/vdl/).
 
 Note:
 Due to the nature of this patch and the size of the ^PXRMINDX global
 that could be created on your system, the Office of Information strongly
 recommends that patch PXRM*1.5*20 be reviewed. 
  
 Patch 20 provided an estimated sizing utility that should have already
 been run on your system. It can be re-run, if desired.
  
 This index global will be large. Please be sure that your system manager
 is aware of this and the global growth potential before you do the 
 installation.
  
 Please read all the documentation before you proceed with the installation
 of PXRM*1.5*12.
