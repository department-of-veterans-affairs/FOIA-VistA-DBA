Subject: MULTIPLE POSTING OF PARTIALS, REFLECT DBIA 2621 IN TWO ROUTINES

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues:
 1 - The same partial fill can be refilled multiple times. After patch PSD*3*39
 was installed sites are able to release a partial in the CS package more than
 once, updating the inventory each time. This needs to be modified to allow
 only once.
      
 2 - DBIA 212 is being referenced incorrectly in the PSDDSOR and PSDDSOR2
 routines. DBIA 2621 needs to be modified to address the fields referenced and
 the routines need to be modified as comments only reflecting the reference to
 DBIA 2621.

 2. ISB-0903-31237   IA 212 to be replaced with 2621
 
 Problem #1:
 -----------
 CLL-1203-40540  Package allows multiple posting of partials.
 
 When using PSD Outpatient Rx's - the option allows you to post the same
 partial prescription fill multiple times.
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification will be made to routine PSDOPT0 to check the partial fill.
 If already posted the partial will not be available for selection for 
 posting.
      
 Problem #2:
 -----------
 ISB-0903-31237   IA 212 to be replaced with 2621
 
 Controlled Substances (PSD) is not a subscriber to IA 212.  However, 
 PSD is a subscriber to IA 2621 which is already referenced in routines
 PSDDSOR and PSDDSOR2.  References to IA 212 need to be removed.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A request will be made to the G.DBA group to modify the IA2621 agreement for
 the following fields:
 PIECE 1=NAME
 PIECE 2=MAILING FRANK STREET ADDRESS
 PIECE 5=MAILING FRANK ZIP+4 CODE
 PIECE 7=MAILING FRANK CITY
 PIECE 8=MAILING FRANK STATE
 of ^PS(59,DO,0 as direct global reads
 Modifications will also be made to routines PSDDSOR and PSDDSOR2 to remove
 the references to IA212.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES package.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload the 
    KIDS distribution included with the message.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
    SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
    (when  prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSD*3.0*45):
  
         a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
            is installed. It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
         b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
            Transport Global.
  
         c. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
            the components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSD*3.0*45.
  
 6. When prompted with, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    YES//', respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
