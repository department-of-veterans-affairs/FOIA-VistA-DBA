Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

    *** This patch may be installed at any time EXCEPT for between 
        February 28, 2000 and March 3, 2000.
  
 This patch addresses three NOIS as described below.
  
 Overview of NOIS messages
 -------------------------
  
 1.  DEN-0100-52983
 Problem:
 --------
 In OOPS*1.0*5 an inadvertent change was made to the Log of Federal 
 Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Option [OOPS UNION LOG] that allows the 
 user to include names of persons involved.  Union users were given access 
 to the prompt 'Cases to be included:' which allows for selection of 
 Employees/Volunteers (E/V) or All Employees & also allows the user to include 
 the names of persons involved.  This modification was unintentional.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installation of this patch the Union user will not be prompted for 
 'Cases to be included:' and will not be able to select E/V or ALL and will 
 not be able to include names with this report.
  
 2.  CMO-0200-40133
 Problem:
 --------
 An 'end of file encountered' error occurs when running the Print Accident 
 Report Status Option [OOPS SAFETY PRINT STATUS], [OOPS SUP PRINT STATUS], or 
 [OOPS UNION PRINT STATUS] to a printer.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Programming changes have been made to properly close the device after 
 printing.
  
 3. MIA-0200-30670
 Problem:
 --------
 The Log Summary for the Log of Federal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses
 Option [OOPS UNION LOG] is not correctly summing the total number of Fatal
 or Lost Time incidents.  The report currently does not differentiate 
 between injuries or illnesses.  The report currently counts each Fatal and 
 Lost Time incident for both injury and illness, thus doubling the total count 
 for each category.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installation of this patch, the Log Summary will report the total 
 number of Fatal and Lost Time incidents correctly separating the injuries 
 and illnesses.
  
  
          ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
