Subject: SCHEDULING REPLACEMENT API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Scheduling V. 5.3 package is moving the patient appointment information
 stored in the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2) and the
 APPOINTMENT sub-file  (#44.001) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) to the
 Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) database. Eventually, these sub-files will
 be deleted from the Scheduling files. As part of the Scheduling Replacement
 Project, Scheduling V. 5.3 package is providing a series of Application
 Programmer Interface calls (APIs) that will be used to get the patient
 appointment information from the new GOTS database. This is the Outpatient
 Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch that replaces all direct references to the patient
 appointment information in the Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT)
 [PSO ACTION PROFILE ] option, with the new APIs. 
  
 2. NOIS OKL-0204-70524
 The Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE ] option is 
 supposed to list only the active med orders if zero is entered for the
 prompt "Profile Expiration/Discontinued Cutoff:  (0-9999): 120//", but
 it also shows discontinued med orders. This patch ensures that if the
 cutoff days is zero, only the active med orders will be listed. For
 all other cutoff days the report will show the discontinued and expired
 med orders.

 patch. Installation will take no longer than 2 minutes. There are no
 scheduling restrictions or recommendations.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*155) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
