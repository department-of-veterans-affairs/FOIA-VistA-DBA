Subject: CORRECT AUTO UPLOAD OF ORU~Z05

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Developed in MNT,VMM.
  
 The patch addresses the following NOIS issues:
        CHY-0203-50674 - Veteran hung up in IVM Upload Option   
        CPH-0203-40485 - <NULLSUBSCR>AUTOADDR+34^IVMLDEM6:3             
        MAD-0203-40238 - DEM UPLOAD SCREEN HAS BLANK ADDRESS    
        MAD-0103-40092 - Demographic Upload w/NO data           
        SBY-1202-31599 - Null Subscript at AUTOADDR+34^IVMLDEM6:3
        HUN-0203-20067 - <UNDEF(ECODE)>DEFACK+3^HLCSIN:5
  
 All of these NOIS issues are related to the processing of the ORU~Z05 - 
 Demographics Data Transmission from the HEC, and the auto uploading of the 
 patient's address functionality introduced by the Geographic Means Test 
 Phase I patches.
  
 The issues are:
    1. When the address information is auto uploaded to the PATIENT (#2) 
       file, an entry is left in the IVM PATIENT (#301.5) file with out any 
       uploadable or non-uploadable fields.  This leaves an entry in the 
       [IVM UPLOAD DEM] Demographics Upload option that requires the user 
       to select the entry to clear it from the list.
    2. As a result of an allocation error fixed by the patch, DG*5.3*496, 
       null address data entries are remaining in the IVM CENTER DATA field
       (#.02 of the DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD DATA (#301.511) multiple of the 
       INCOMING SEGMENT (#301.501) multiple of the #301.5 file).  This also 
       leaves an entry in the [IVM UPLOAD DEM] Demographics Upload option.
       However, normal user processing may not clear this entry.
    3. The PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] field is excluded from the auto upload 
       of the PATIENT file.  This field is not currently being compared to
       the existing DHCP value for the PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] field (#.311
       of the #2 file) before storing the phone number as an uploadable 
       field.
    4. A <NULLSUBSCR>AUTOADDR+34^IVMLDEM6 error is sometimes generated as 
       a result of an auto upload when no address data is available for 
       filing.
  
 This patch will implement the following changes to address the NOIS issues:
  
    1. $$AUTOADDR^IVMLDEM6 is modified to check for the existence of 
       uploadable or non-uploadable fields using the $$DEMO^IVMDLEM5 API.
       If no fields are found, then the routine will call $$DELETE^IVMLDEM5
       to delete the PID entry from the INCOMING SEGMENT multiple of the 
       IVM PATIENT file.  This API is also modified to prevent the 
       <NULLSUBSCR>AUTOADDR+34^IVMLDEM6 error.
    2. DG*5.3*496 fixed the underlying cause of the allocation errors by 
       removing the timestamp requirement on the ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM 
       (#.118) field of the PATIENT file.  The API $$RF1^IVMPREC8 is 
       modified to add the initialization of the FDA and ERRMSG local 
       arrays.
    3. $$PID^IVMPREC8 is modified to compare the PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] 
       to the existing DHCP value.  The following special characters will
       be excluding from the values when making the comparison (" ", ")",
       "(", "/", "#", "\", and "-").
  
 The patch includes a post-install processor that will cleanup the following 
 scenarios in the IVM PATIENT file.
  
    1. Execute the new PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] field comparison logic, 
       and delete any entries from the DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD DATA multiple
       where the IVM CENTER DATA is the same as the DHCP data.
    2. Remove any address field entries from the DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD DATA 
       multiple that have a null IVM CENTER DATA field value.
    3. Remove any PID entries from the INCOMING SEGMENT multiple that do 
       not have any uploadable or non-uploadable fields.
  
 The post-install processor will generate a MailMan bulletin and send it to 
 the person who installed the patch.  The message will contain the total 
 number of records updated.  For each record updated, it will display the 
 IEN of the PATIENT file, the IEN of the IVM PATIENT file, the SOCIAL 
 SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09 of the #2 file), the NAME field (#.01 of the #2 
 file), an Address flag to indicate a null address field was deleted from 
 the IVM PATIENT file, and a Phone Number flag to indicate that a Phone 
 Number field was deleted from the IVM PATIENT file.  If neither flag is 
 set, then the IVM PATIENT entry was deleted because it did not contain any 
 uploadable or non-uploadable fields.
  
 Here is an example of the bulletin:

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation could
 take as long as 90 minutes.  Therefore, it is suggested that the installation 
 of this patch be queued during off peak hours.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
    the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter IVM*2.0*73)
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
    
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package IVM*2.0*73
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
    respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES. 
  
    Select the following options to place out of order:
        [IVM UPLOAD DEM]       Demographics Upload
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
    completion.
  
 9. Reschedule any jobs that were unscheduled to install this patch.
