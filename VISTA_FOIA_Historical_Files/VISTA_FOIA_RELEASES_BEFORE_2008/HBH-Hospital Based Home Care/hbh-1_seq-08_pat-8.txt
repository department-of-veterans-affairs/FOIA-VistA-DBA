   Patch Installation Information:
   ==============================
  
   Pre-Installation:
   ================
  
     1)  Using VA FileMan, ensure Package file (#9.4) contains entry with a
         PREFIX of HBH
         (Your site's package file listing may vary from the example) 
  
   Note:  If your site uses the package file for tracking patch installation
   information or for some other purpose, please evaluate what is valid &
   your approach as to what you retain.
  
  
  Select OPTION:    ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
  
  INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PACKAGE//
  EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// PREFIX
  THEN EDIT FIELD:
  
  
  Select PACKAGE NAME: HBH
       1   HBH PATCH 1 INITS          HBHY      1.0
       2   HBH V1.0 PATCH 2 INITS          HBHX      1.0
       3   HBHC  HOSPITAL BASED HOME CARE        HBHC      1.0
  CHOOSE 1-3: 3  HOSPITAL BASED HOME CARE
  PREFIX: HBHC// HBH
  
  
     2)  Package file (#9.4) "C" cross-reference should be checked for
     validity.  There may be some 'orphaned' entries that should be deleted.
  
       >D ^%G
  
       Global ^DIC(9.4,"C","HBH":"HBHZ"
               DIC(9.4,"C","HBH":"HBHZ"
       ^DIC(9.4,"C","HBH",455) =
       ^DIC(9.4,"C","HBHV",455) =
       ^DIC(9.4,"C","HBHX",372) =
       ^DIC(9.4,"C","HBHY",361) =
  
      Ensure your site has a "C" cross-reference for HBH.  Ensure your site
      has a valid corresponding entry for the internal entry number of the
      HBH entry.  Other HBHx "C" cross-references &/or file entries should
      be deleted.

   ==================
  
   Install name will be:  HBH*1.0*08

   PackMan message.  Patch installation time should be minimal.
  
     1.  Use the "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" menu option on the PackMan menu.
         This option will load the KIDS distribution in this message onto
         your system.
  
     2.  From the "KIDS Installation" menu, select the option "Verify
         Checksums in Transport Global" and verify that all routines have the
         correct checksum.  (See routine checksum listing under Routine
         Summary section)
 
     3.  From the "KIDS Installation" menu, select the option "Backup a
         Transport Global"
