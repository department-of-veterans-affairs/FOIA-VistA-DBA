Description: 
============

  
  1)  This patch exports the following Health Summary Types to be used
      nationally for Remote Data Views:
   
           REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (3M)
           REMOTE MEDS/LABS/ORDERS (3M)
           REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (3M)
           REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (3M)
           REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (1Y)
           REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (1Y)
           REMOTE MEDS/LABS/ORDERS (1Y)
           REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (1Y)
           REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (4Y)
           REMOTE LABS LONG VIEW (12Y)
           REMOTE LABS ALL (1Y)
           REMOTE LABS ALL (3M)
           REMOTE DIS SUM/SURG/PROD (12Y)
           REMOTE OUTPATIENT MEDS (6M)
  
  2)  GMTSDEMB/GMTSU2 have been changed so that the Brief Demographics
      component now displays the "Source of Info: " for Remote Data Views
      so that when printed the site where the data was extracted is printed
      with the report.
   
  3)  GMTSLRCE now calls supported Kernel Utilities for HL7 dates instead
      of old date conversion formerly contained in routine GMTSU.
   
  4)  GMTSRM/GMTSULT/GMTSUIX were modified to protect the nationally
      exported Health Summary Types.
  
  5)  Option GMTS TYPE DELETE has been modified to prevent the deletion
      of a nationally exported Health Summary Type.
