Associated patches: (v)XU*8*49         install with patch       `XU*8*63'

Subject: Consolidated error screening.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  
  This patch was requested because of different errors that needed to be 
  screened at the OpenM site.
   
  This patch updates the error routines and Taskman to use a common place to
  check to see if errors should NOT be recorded or should be screened from
  the normal XTER listing.  The current ERROR MESSAGE file has been enhanced
  to control this action.  The %ZTER routine checks the list and will not
  record errors that are flagged not to record.
   
  Sites can add their own entries to the file.  There is a field to allow
  the advanced strings that Taskman has been using.  Current entries in
  Taskmans error screen file are moved to the new file as part of the
  install.
