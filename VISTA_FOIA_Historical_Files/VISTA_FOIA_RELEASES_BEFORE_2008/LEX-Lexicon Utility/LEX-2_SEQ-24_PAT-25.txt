  This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health 
  Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
  routines, globals and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets
  for the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification
  (ICD-9-CM), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care 
  Financing Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS).
  When implemented, the Lexicon will allow translation of these three 
  code systems to select codes based upon a date that an event occurred 
  with the Standards Development Organization (SDO) established specific
  code that existed on that event date.
  
  This patch is one of three installs contained in a combined KIDS 
  distribution:
  
      CSV UTIL 1.0
  
          LEX*2.0*25
          ICD*18.0*6
          ICPT*6.0*14
  
  The multi-package distribution consists of both a KIDS host file and a
  data global host file:
  
      KIDS Distribution        CSV_UTIL_1_0.KID
      Data Global              CSV_UTIL_1_0.GBL
