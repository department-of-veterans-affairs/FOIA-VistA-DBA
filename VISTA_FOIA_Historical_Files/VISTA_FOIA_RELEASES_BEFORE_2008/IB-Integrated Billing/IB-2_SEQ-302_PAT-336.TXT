Associated patches: (v)IB*2*309    <<= must be installed BEFORE `IB*2*336'

Subject: PHARMACY CLAIMS TRACKING FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 With the release of the Clinical Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) software,
 IB*2.0*260, it was discovered that some entries in the Claims Tracking
 (#356) file were not marked with a Reason Not Billable (RNB) for
 prescription claims.  This could cause Service Connected (SC)
 prescriptions to be billed erroneously to the 3rd party insurance 
 carrier. With the installation of this patch, new Claims Tracking entries
 will be appropriately marked, if applicable, with a RNB.  In addition, an
 e-mail report will be automatically generated for the MCCF staff to review
 and make a billable determination.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD124070   Bills Being Created for SC RX Fills
  
    Problem:
    --------
    With the release of CIDC software, Claims Tracking had more complete
    information contained in new fields in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file.  
    However, those new fields are only populated for new prescriptions and
    not for existing refills.  IB Claims Tracking was changed to look at
    only the new fields and did not keep the previous code to properly
    review older prescriptions that did not have the new fields.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A check was added to Claims Tracking that determines if a prescription
    has the new fields or not.  If not, then IB Claims Tracking reverts to
    the previous evaluation rules for the prescription.
  
    TECHNICAL:
    ==========
    1. HD124070   Bills Being Created for SC RX Fills:
  
       Code was added to check for existence of the "ICD" node in the 
       PRESCRIPTION (#52) file.  If the node exists then the CT software
       will continue to use the new enhanced CIDC evaluation of the
       prescription.  However, if an "ICD" node does not exist then CT will
       use the pre-CIDC code to evaluate the prescription and mark the CT
       entry appropriately.
  
       A post install is included in this patch.  The post install will 
       evaluate all CT entries that have been added since the initial
       install of CIDC at the site.  If the CT entry is prescription 
       related, does not have a Reason Not Billable, and does not have an
       "ICD" node in the ^PSRX global then a re-evaluation is made based on
       the pre-CIDC RNB determination.  If a RNB is found then the CT entry
       is included in the post install report.  The post install report is
       automatically loaded into a MailMan message and addressed to the
       patch installer, holders of the IB SUPERVISOR key, and holders of
       the IB CLAIMS SUPERVISOR key.  Sites should review the MailMan
       report to determine if any CT entries need a RNB added or any bills
       need to be cancelled.
  
       As an additional note, if sites were to review the "IBQ" node 
       containing the SERVICE CONNECTED response in the PRESCRIPTION (#52)
       file, they might find inaccurate information for patients that are
       greater than 49% service connected.  That field is used only for
       copayment processing in the Outpatient Pharmacy package and is not
       valid for any 3rd party billing determinations.
