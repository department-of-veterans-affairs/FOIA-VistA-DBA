Subject: NURSE ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULES

Description:
============

 Public Law 108-445 was amended to establish new alternative work 
 schedules (AWS) in order to obtain or retain the services of registered
 nurses in any department healthcare facility. This enhancement patch adds
 new functionality and modifies existing functionality to implement two new
 alternative work schedules for nurses; 36/40 AWS and 9 month/3 month AWS,
 which are described below. 
  
   36/40 AWS
   ---------
   A schedule available to full-time nurses in pay plan K or M. This
   schedule requires a tour that consists of exactly three twelve hour
   tours of duty within each administrative work week of the pay period
   (Sunday through Saturday). Although this schedule requires only 72 hours
   of work per pay period, nurses on this schedule will be considered full
   time for pay and leave purposes.
    
   9 month/3 month AWS
   -------------------
   A schedule available to part-time nurses in pay plan M who are FLSA
   exempt. This schedule requires 9 months of work at 80 hours per pay
   period and three months of recess where they will not be scheduled to
   perform work. Although they will work eighty hours per pay period for
   nine months of the year, they are considered part-time for pay and leave
   purposes.
  
  
 On-Line Data Entry system (OLDE)
 --------------------------------
 For nurses authorized to work either of the new alternative work
 schedules, the users in Human Resources will need to make the appropriate
 updates to the nurse's duty basis and normal hours in OLDE. When the
 Corporate Franchise Data Center (CFD) downloads the nurse's updates to the
 sites, the timekeepers can then establish the appropriate tours in VistA
 Electronic Time and Attendance (ETA).
  
  
 Remarks Code 17 OT/CT With Premiums
 -----------------------------------
 This patch also adds a new remarks code that can be used when posting
 time for any employee, including employees using either of the above two
 alternative work schedules. The new code is described below under the 
 section describing modifications to the Post Employee Time option
 within the Timekeeper section (3).
  
  
 SSN Display
 -----------
 Through consultation with subject matter experts, representatives from
 VA Payroll and the VHA Privacy Office it has been determined that
 options used to access individual employee data shall be displayed with
 only the last four digits of the SSN in readable format. The new
 display format will utilize the capital letter X as a place holder for
 the screened out digits and shall appear on the screen as:  XXX-XX-NNNN.
  
 To assist supervisors in identifying the correct employee record in the
 event that the name and the last four digits of the SSN are identical,
 the first digit of the SSN shall be added to the display of options used
 by these personnel. The new format for these options shall appear as: 
  
   NXX-XX-NNNN 
  
 There is a separate patch (PRS*4.0*114) to address the new display of
 the SSN throughout the VistA PAID ETA package, however, this patch
 (PRS*4.0*112) does make SSN display updates as described above to the
 following options that are already included in this patch as part of the
 Nurse Alternative Work Schedule updates:
  
     Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV] 
     Display Leave Requests   [PRSA LV DISP] 
  
  
 Documentation and Training:
 --------------------------- 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
    
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
 Documentation can also be found on the System Design and Development Web 
 page at:  http://www.va.gov/vdl/
  
 Below is a list of the files related to this patch that will be needed and 
 available via the FTP sites listed above.

 The modifications made by this patch are briefly described below:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. Human Resources
    ---------------
    A new option has been attached to the existing Employee Inquiry/Reports 
    Menu [PRSD 05 EMPLOYEE INQUIRY MENU]. A brief description of this new
    option follows:
  
      Review FY Recess for 9 Month AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-HR]
  
        This is a view only option that provides a display of the recess
        schedule for nurses on the 9 month/3 month alternative work
        schedule (AWS). To select a 9 month/3 month AWS recess schedule to
        view, enter either a fiscal year or the nurse's name. Once the
        schedule is selected, the user may enter actions at the select
        action prompt to navigate through the recess schedule, print the
        recess schedule and display a summary. Enter ?? at the select
        action prompt to see the complete list of available actions.
  
 2. Employee
    -------- 
    A new option has been attached to the existing Employee Menu [PRSA EMP 
    MENU]. The new option is locked with the new PRSAWS9 security key. This
    key should be assigned to nurses working 9 month/3 month AWS. A brief
    description of this new option follows:
  
      Review FY Recess for 9 Month AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-NURSE]
  
        This is a view only option that provides a display of the recess
        schedule for a 9 month/3 month alternative work schedule (AWS). To
        select a 9 month/3 month AWS recess schedule, enter a fiscal year. 
        Once the schedule is selected, enter actions at the Select Action
        prompt to navigate through the recess schedule, print the recess
        schedule and display a summary. Enter ?? at the select action prompt
        to see the complete list of available actions. Nurses must hold the
        new PRSAWS9 security key to access this option. 
  
  
    The following two employee leave options have been modified by the patch
    to behave differently for nurses working a 9 month/3 month AWS
    and for nurses working a 36/40 AWS. 
  
      Leave Request [PRSA LV REQ]
      Edit Leave Request [PRSA LV EDIT]
  
        Nurses working a 9 month/3 month AWS do not accrue leave during
        periods of recess. These options are modified to correctly
        calculate leave balances by not adding accrued leave during periods
        of recess between the current date and the date of the leave
        request. The RECESS TRACKNG (#458.8) file is used to determine if
        the nurse will be on recess. The projected leave balances are used
        in this option to provide warnings if leave balances may go
        negative. 
  
        Nurses working a 36/40 AWS are charged 1.111 hours for each hour
        of leave taken. These options are modified to correctly calculate
        leave balances by adjusting the leave request to the correct rate
        of 1.111 per hour.
  
    The following employee option is modified by the patch, adding new
    exceptions for nurses working a 36/40 AWS.
  
      Display Pay Period [PRSA TPD PP-EMP]
  
        Nurses working a 36/40 AWS are required to be scheduled for exactly
        three tours of duty that are twelve hours long, for each administrative
        work week (Sunday through Saturday) of the pay period. The following
        four new warnings will appear, as appropriate, in the bottom portion
        of this report if the AWS 36/40 tour of duty is not set up correctly:
        
            36/40 AWS tours require
             -no 2 day tours on Sat
             -3 12 hr tours/wk 1
             -3 12 hr tours/wk 2
             -no prior pp carryover
  
 3. Timekeeper
    ----------
    Two new options have been attached to the existing Employee Data [PRSA
    TK MEN-EMP] menu which is a submenu on the Timekeeper Main Menu [PRSA
    TK MENU]. A brief description of these new options follow:
  
      Recess Enter/Edit for 9 Month AWS [PRSA RECESS ENTER/EDIT AWS]
  
        This option provides timekeepers the ability to enter and edit
        recess schedules for nurses working a 9 month/3 month alternative
        work schedule (AWS). Timekeepers may only enter or edit recess
        schedules for nurses on the 9-month/3-month AWS that are within T&L
        units assigned to them. When entering a new recess schedule the
        date that the AWS becomes effective is required. If a date is
        entered that is not the first Sunday of the pay period then the
        option assumes the first Sunday for the pay period in which the
        user supplied date falls. The option limits the available recess
        schedules for entry and editing to the current, next and last
        fiscal years. The option invokes the ListManager to produce a list
        of weeks in calendar format from the first week of the AWS through
        the end of the fiscal year. 
  
      Review FY Recess for 9 Month AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-TK]
  
        This is a view only option that provides a display of the recess
        schedule for nurses on the 9 month/3 month alternate work schedule
        (AWS). Timekeepers may view any recess schedule for nurses in T&L
        units that have been assigned to them.
  
    Existing timekeeper options have been modified by the patch to
    behave differently for nurses working on either of the two new AWSs
    These modified options are listed below:
  
      Post Employee Time [PRSA TK POST]
  
        This option is modified to allow the timekeeper to record periods
        of recess and periods of work during recess on the timecard of
        nurses working the 9 month/3 month AWS. It is expected that the
        timekeeper will maintain the employee's tour and post a daily
        exception during periods of recess for the nurses on the 9-month
        AWS. Any work performed during the recess period shall be posted
        as an exception along with recess exceptions. The option is
        modified so that timekeepers post a new type of time--recess (RS),
        only if the nurse is pay plan M, duty basis part-time, FLSA
        exempt and normal hours of 80 for the pay period being posted and
        when recess is scheduled in the RECESS TRACKING (#458.8) file for
        the administrative work week being posted. The modifications allow
        posting that the nurse was absent the entire tour or that they were
        on recess for a portion of the tour, using the new RS type of time
        code. The modifications allow a posting of a recess period on the
        timecard, along with postings of work, such as, comptime earned,
        overtime, unscheduled regular, etc., that overlap the segments
        of the scheduled tour that are posted as recess. 
  
        A new time remark--OT/CT With Premiums (#17) --has been added to
        the TIME REMARKS (#457.4) file for use in the Post Employee Time
        option. This new time remark can be used for all employees who are
        entitled to receive Saturday/Sunday premium and night differential.
        All Saturday/Sunday hours posted with this code will receive
        Saturday/Sunday premium and all hours posted with this code between
        6:00P-6:00A will be credited with night differential.
  
      Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty [PRSA TK TOUR-EDIT]
  
        This option is modified to produce the following new warnings when the
        timekeepers don't enter 3 12-hour tours in each week of the pay
        period for 36/40 AWS nurses:
  
          1. There are not three 12 hour tours in week 1 and/or week 2 for 
             this AWS 36/40 Nurse
          2. Hours in week 1 and/or week 2 are not 36 for this AWS 36/40 Nurse.
          3. Tour overlaps two administrative work weeks for this 36/40 Nurse.
  
  
      List Daily Exceptions [PRSA TPE ONE]
      Display Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE ALL]
      List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE PPE]
  
        See the Timecard Exceptions section below for a description of 
        the changes to the above three options.
       
        The four 36/40 AWS tour of duty warnings, described above in 
        the Employee section (2), under the changes for the Display Pay 
        Period option, will appear on these reports as well.       
  
 4. Supervisors
    -----------
    A new option has been attached to the existing Employee Reports 
    [PRSRSU-PAID SYSTEM REPORTS] menu which is a submenu on the T&A 
    Supervisor Menu [PRSA SUP MENU] and the T&A OT/Supervisor 
    [PRSA OT MENU]. A brief description of this new option follows:
  
      Review FY Recess for 9 Month AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-SUP]
  
        This is a view only option that provides a display of the recess
        schedule for nurses on the 9 month/3 month alternate work schedule
        (AWS). To select a 9 month/3 month AWS recess schedule to view,
        first enter the T&L unit of the nurse, then enter either a fiscal
        year or the nurses name. Once the schedule is selected, the user
        may enter actions at the select action prompt to navigate through
        the recess schedule, print the recess schedule and display a
        summary. Enter ?? at the select action prompt to see the complete
        list of available actions. 
  
 5. Payroll
    -------
    A new option has been attached to the existing Employee Inquiry/Reports 
    Menu [PRSD 05 EMPLOYEE INQUIRY MENU] which is a submenu on the Payroll
    Main Menu [PRSA PAY MENU]. The new option, Review FY Recess for 
    9 Month AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-HR] is described in the 
    Human Resources (1) section above. 
  
    Existing Payroll Main Menu options modified by the patch are listed below.
  
      Open Next Pay Period [PRSA PP OPEN]
        The option has been modified to identify nurses that are working either
        of the new AWS and will send a bulletin to the Exchange distribution
        list, VHA OI ETA PAID NAWS BULLETIN, with counts of nurses working
        each schedule. The number of bulletins sent is controlled by fields
        in the new file PAID PARAMETERS (#456) and is initially set to 5 by
        the post-install program, PRSXP112, included with this patch.
  
      Display Employee Entitlements [PRSA EN EMP]
        The patch modifies the following in the display:
  
          1. A new entitlement, Recess Periods, has been added for the 
             new type of time--recess (RS). This new entitlement replaces
             the existing entitlement--Reg Hrs. at OT Rate - 3.
          2. Reg Hrs. at OT Rate - 2, has been replaced with Reserved for
             future use.
          3. Reg. Hrs. at OT Rate - Day, has been renamed to FF Reg. Sch.
             Hrs. Over 53.
  
        The following entries in the PAY ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file have
        been updated to remove entitlements to items 1 and 2 above:
  
          0 1 E
          0 2 E
          0 3 E
  
        The following entry in the PAY ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file has been
        updated to turn off entitlement to FF Reg. Sch. Hrs. Over 53 
        and to turn on entitlement to Hrs. >8 - Day. This change is 
        the result of Remedy Ticket #195715.
  
          N 2 N PPI=S
  
  
      Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA PAY EXC]
      List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA PAY PPE]
  
        See the Timecard Exceptions section below for a description of 
        the changes to the above two options.
  
    The following describes updates to the existing option, 8B Edit
    Checks [PRSA EDIT], on the Payroll Supervisor Menu [PRSA PAY MGR].
  
      8B Edit Checks [PRSA EDIT]
  
        The edit checks have been modified to allow the following:
          1. duty basis code 1 with normal hours of 72 for employees in 
             pay plan K or M.
          2. duty basis code 2 with normal hours of 80 for employees in 
             pay plan M.
  
  
 6. Timecard Exceptions
    -------------------
    The patch modifies pay period exception logic which affects the 
    following options:
  
      1.  Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV]
      2.  List Daily Exceptions [PRSA TPE ONE]
      3.  List Daily Exceptions [PRSA TPE ONE-SUP]
      4.  Display Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE ALL]
      5.  Display Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE ALL-SUP]
      6.  List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA SUP PPE]
      7.  List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA TPE PPE]
      8.  Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA PAY EXC]
      9.  List Prior Pay Period Exceptions [PRSA PAY PPE]
  
  
     The following new exceptions are added to the above options by 
     the patch. They will be reported:
  
       1. when RS is posted outside the tour. 
       2. when RS is posted to the tour and any leave posting
          overlaps the RS posting. 
       3. when a 36/40 AWS tour of duty does not have exactly 3 twelve
          hour shifts within each administrative week of the pay period.
         (See above section--2. Employee/Display Pay Period--for actual 
          error text).
  
     The patch also modifies the exceptions so that the following timecard 
     postings will not be reported as exceptions:
  
       1. overtime is posted within a tour and that period of time is
          also posted with RS.
       2. comptime is posted within a tour and that period of time is 
          also posted with RS.
       3. unscheduled regular is posted within a tour and that period of 
          time is also posted with RS.
       4. on call is posted within a tour and that period of time is also 
          posted with RS.
  
   
 7. Timecard Decomposition
    ----------------------
    The patch modifies the decomposition logic which is executed from the
    following two options:
  
      Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV]
      Decompose Time [PRSA PAY DECOMP]
  
    The following changes are made to the decomposition process:
  
    36/40 AWS
    ---------
    Each of the three twelve hour tours of duty will be posted as regular
    hours. Any time worked over 12 hours in a day or over 36 hours in an
    administrative work week shall be considered overtime. Other normal
    premium pays (weekend, night diff, etc.) will apply. The only exception
    to this will occur when the employee has incurred Non-Pay or Without
    Pay. During weeks with Non-Pay or Without Pay, these employees will be
    treated as part time employees. The hours worked in the week will be 36
    hours minus the amount of Non-Pay or Without Pay and the employee will
    have to exceed 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in the week before they
    will be eligible for overtime or comptime. 
  
    There are no new Type of Time codes for the 36/40 AWS nurses. The 
    timekeepers will continue to post that these employees worked their
    regularly scheduled tours on Saturday and Sunday or extra work using
    the existing Types of Time and Remarks Code combinations.
  
    The decomp has been updated to identify the 36/40 nurses and if their
    tours occur on a Saturday or Sunday it will automatically report those
    tour hours in the 8B string using the following new 8B codes. The same
    would apply for tour hours that are eligible for night differential.
  
    |--------------------------------------|
    | Definition               Code   Code |
    |                          Wk1    Wk2  |
    |--------------------------------------|
    | Saturday Premium-AWS     SR     SS   |
    | Sunday Premium-AWS       SD     SH   |
    | Night Differential-AWS   ND     NU   |
    |--------------------------------------|
  
    All of these codes would be paid using the new 1872 divisor.
  
    Any work outside of the tours on a Saturday or Sunday would be posted
    using the existing Types of Time and would be reported using the 
    existing Weekend premium codes and would be paid using the regular
    divisor.
  
  
    9 month/3 month AWS:
    --------------------
    Employees will earn leave and be charged leave in the normal manner for
    part-time employees during their work period. They will not earn or be
    charged leave in their recess time, except if they actually work during
    their recess. If they work during their recess, they will earn leave
    for regular hours worked. Leave cannot be charged during the recess
    time. A timecard will still be used during the recess period.
  
    The 3 months of recess can be split into more than one piece
    if needed. If a week contains both normal work and recess, hours of
    recess will not be included in the hours worked in the day or week 
    count when determining the eligibility for overtime or comptime.
  
    Nurses on the 9 month AWS can be called back to work during periods of
    scheduled recess. If an employee works during their recess time, the
    recess indicator will be sent along with any time actually worked.
    Time worked during recess will be handled as regular hours up to 8
    hours in a day. Any hours over 8 in a day or 40 in a week will be
    considered overtime. Premium pay rules will apply to hours actually
    worked, not the recess time.
  
    The new Recess (RS) Type of Time will only be available for nurses on
    the 9mo AWS. In addition, the new RS Type of Time code will only be
    available for posting during pay periods where there is a corresponding
    Recess entry on file in the new RECESS TRACKING (#458.8) file.
  
  
    HD186029 Payment of Overtime:
    -----------------------------
    During integration testing with Central PAID it was discovered that 
    one of the business rules that we updated as part of patch PRS*4.0*102 
    was incorrect. The business rule was updated so Without Pay and
    Non-Pay would not reduce the count of hours worked in the day. We will
    be changing this rule back to its prior state so that Without Pay and
    Non-Pay will reduce the count of hours worked in the day.
  
    HD195715 Overtime Incorrect for PT Employee on Compressed Tour:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    During Alpha testing for the NAWS project the NAWS development team 
    was approached by EVS to research the decomp related Remedy ticket 
    #195715. EVS noted that VACO said that this problem had only showed up
    recently and that it used to work correctly. After researching this
    issue we have identified that the problem is the result of an incorrect
    entry in the PAY ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file. Further research revealed
    that this incorrect entry was accidentally introduced during the DFAS
    work in patch PRS*4.0*102 when we updated all of the entries related to
    entitlements for FLSA Exempt employees. This entry (N 2 N PPI=S) is
    for Part Time employees in Pay Plan N who are FLSA Non-Exempt and
    should not have been updated at all. This patch will correct this 
    entry.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request(s) NSR(s):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Nurse Alternate Work Schedules (#20060305)
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD186029 Payment of Overtime
 2. HD195715 Overtime Incorrect for PT Employee on Compressed Tour
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. HD186029 Payment of Overtime
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During integration testing with Central PAID it was discovered that
 one of the business rules that we updated as part of patch PRS*4.0*102
 was incorrect. The business rule was updated so Without Pay and
 Non-Pay would not reduce the count of hours worked in the day.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 We will be changing this rule back to its prior state so that Without
 Pay and Non-Pay will reduce the count of hours worked in the day.
  
  
 2. HD195715 Overtime Incorrect for PT Employee on Compressed Tour
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During Alpha testing for the NAWS project the NAWS development team
 was approached by EVS to research the decomp related Remedy ticket
 #195715. VACO had reported to EPS that this problem had only showed up
 recently and that it used to work correctly. After researching this
 issue we have identified that the problem is the result of an incorrect
 entry in the PAY ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) file. Further research revealed
 that this incorrect entry was accidentally introduced during the DFAS
 work in patch PRS*4.0*102 when we updated all of the entries related to
 entitlements for FLSA Exempt employees. This entry (N 2 N PPI=S) is
 for Part Time employees in Pay Plan N who are FLSA Non-Exempt and
 should not have been updated at all. This patch will correct this
 entry.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will correct this entry back to its pre patch PRS*4.0*102
 entitlements.

   PRSAWS9
   --------
   This key grants access to the option--Review FY Recess for 9 Month
   AWS Employee [PRSA RECESS VIEWER-NURSE]. Nurses on the 9 month AWS
   must hold this key and use the option to view their AWS 9 month
   recess schedule entered by their timekeeper. When the timekeeper
   saves a recess schedule for a nurse on the 9 month/3 month AWS, the
   software will automatically assign the key to the nurse, if the nurse
   is set up correctly in the NEW PERSON [#200] file and the key is in
   the SECURITY KEY [#19.1] file.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Post Install routine PRSXP112 will add an entry to the new file PAID
 PARAMETERS (#456) and populate the 4 fields in that file that 
 control the new AWS bulletins.  The initial values will turn on the 
 bulletin feature, limit the number of bulletins to five for each 
 type of new AWS and initialize the count of bulletins sent to zero.
  
  
  ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ======================
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users. It
 is strongly recommended that all the PAID ETA options in the OPTION
 (#19) file and all the PAID ETA protocols in the PROTOCOL (#101) file,
 be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS
 install. All the ETA options and protocols can be selected by using the
 PAID ETA namespace of PRS and the asterisk, or wildcard character (*).
 As shown in steps 4.d. and 4.e. of the installation instructions, type
 PRS*, to disable all PAID ETA options and protocols. Other VISTA users
 will not be affected. 
  
   
 Install Time - Less than 5 minutes.

          Utilities ...
          Installation ...
  
     Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                              ---
          Load a Distribution

          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
          Restart Install of Package(s)
          Unload a Distribution

 3.  Select Installation Option:
     ---------------------------
     NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
            NAME, enter PRS*4.0*112):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed. It compares all components of this patch.
  
     NOTE:  Patch 113 was inadvertently left off the second line of
            routine PRSAPPH. The routine does contain the patch 113
            modifications and the problem is only with the second line.
            A future patch will restore 113 to the list of patches in
            the second line of routine PRSAPPH.
  
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
