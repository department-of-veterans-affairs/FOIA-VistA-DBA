Subject: LTC COPAY REPORT/714.1 FILE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 Developed in DEV,VOO
 ====================
  
 The patch addresses the following NOIS issues:
 =============================================
 BED-1202-11031 - LTC COPAY CALCULATIONS
 ISA-0802-11996 - LTC Exemption Reason change
  
  
 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 ====================
 The first NOIS that this patch will correct is BED-1202-11031.
   The following problem occurs when using the EASEC LTC COPAY
   PRINT (Calculated LTC Copayments Print) option.
  
   The assets spend-down calculation is not being performed in cases
   where it should be.  The code to determine if the spend-down
   calculation should be done was checking if TOTAL INCOME minus
   TOTAL EXPENSES is not greater than the VET MAX COPAY.  A code
   modification was made to check if TOTAL INCOME minus TOTAL
   EXPENSES minus TOTAL ALLOWANCE is not greater than the VET MAX
   COPAY.
  
   NOTE:  The following comments were added to the EXPLANATION
          OF ASSET SPEND DOWN CALCULATION: section of this report.
          "If the amount of the veteran's income after all expenses
           and allowances are subtracted is greater than the maximum
           copayment then the assets will not be reduced."
  
 The second NOIS that this patch will correct is ISA-0802-11996.
   LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION FILE (714.1) contains the reasons a veteran may
   be exempt from LTC Copayments.  One of the reasons needs to have
   the word "Palliative" removed from the text.  In order to
   accomplish this a post install routine, ^EAS1P24 will be started
   after the installation of this patch has completed.  This routine
   will change the following LTC exemption reason: "LTC RELATED TO
   HOSPICE/PALLIATIVE CARE" to read: "LTC RELATED TO HOSPICE CARE".

   Installation Steps:
   ===================
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.
  
   2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1.0*24 are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*24).
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*24.
  
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install?
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
   7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
      EASEC LTC COPAY PRINT - Calculated LTC Copayments Print
  
   8. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
