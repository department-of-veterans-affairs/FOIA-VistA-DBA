Description: 
============

 This patch fixes the following problems:
  
 1) The Import Radiology/NM Exams [WV IMPORT RAD/NM EXAMS] option errors
    out with an undefined global variable error.
  
 The option loops through the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT file (#70) looking for
 female patients who received certain breast-related procedures and adds
 patient and procedure information into the Women's Health (WH) package.
 The option checks the global node in the PATIENT file (#2) (i.e.,
 ^DPT(DFN,0)) for the patient's gender (piece #2) to determine if the
 patient is a female. At least two facilities reported that they have
 patient internal entry numbers (DFNs) in FILE 70 that are not in FILE 2.
 If the DFN used in FILE 70 is not used in FILE 2, the WH errors out
 because it assumes that each patient has a zero node in FILE 2. The
 routine WVEXPTRA was modified to fix this problem from happening.
  
  
 Associated NOIS: CHA-0199-30421
                  NYN-0199-10431
  
  
 2) A plus sign (+) does not appear after the 'Results Text (WP):' caption.
  
 A user entered text into the Results Text (WP) word-processing field while
 adding a procedure through the Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW
 PROCEDURE] option. After exiting the word-processing field, the user is
 returned to the ScreenMan data entry form. There should be a plus sign (+)
 next to the Results Text (WP): caption to indicate that there is text in
 the field. The user exited and then re-entered the entry. The plus sign
 did appear. However, the plus sign should appear next to the caption
 without making the user exit the entry first. Other WH forms also have
 word-processing fields that had the same problem. Four ScreenMan forms
 were modified to fix the problem. They are:
  
  a) WV PATIENT-FORM-1 which is used by the following option(s):
     Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA]    
  b) WV PROC-FORM-1 which is used by the following option(s):
     Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW PROCEDURE]
     Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE]
     Edit a Procedure Result [WV LAB EDIT PROCEDURE RESULT]
  c) WV PROC-FORM-2-COLP which is used by the following option(s):
     Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW PROCEDURE]
     Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE]
     Edit a Procedure Result [WV LAB EDIT PROCEDURE RESULT]
  d) WV NOTIFPURPOSE-FORM-1 which is used by the following option(s):
     Add/Edit a Notification Purpose & Letter [WV ADD/EDIT NOT PURPOSE&LETT
     ER]
  
 Associated NOIS: BAN-0199-10659
  
 3) The 'Cervical Tx Need' prompt in the Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV
    EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA] option should permit 'Not Indicated' as a
    choice.
  
 When entering the cervical treatment need for a patient, the user should
 be allowed to see and select 'Not Indicated' as a choice. The KIDS build
 will add the new entry of 'Not Indicated' to the WV CERVICAL TX NEED file
 (#790.5).
  
 Associated NOIS: None. Reported by telephone and e-mail by the WH
                  coordinator at the Denver VAMC.
  
 4) Display the 'Family Hx of Breast CA' value for a patient, when the
    patient uses the Patient Profile [WV PATIENT PROFILE] option.
  
 The output from the Patient Profile option should display the value for
 the patient's family history of breast cancer. The routine WVUTL7 was
 modified to fix the problem. The Family HX of Breast CA will appear in the
 output for the Patient Profile Including Errors [WV PATIENT PROFILE
 W/ERRORS] option, too.
  
 Associated NOIS: None. Reported by telephone and e-mail by the WH
                  coordinator at the Denver VAMC.
  
 5) The 'Rad/NM Rpt (WP)' text does not indicate if the report has been
    amended in the Radiology/NM package.
  
 The Rad/NM Rpt (WP) field used in the Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE]
 option displays radiology data from the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file (#74). If
 a radiology report is unverified and then verified again, the user should
 know the report has been changed. The words "AMENDED REPORT" will appear
 with the radiology report data displayed in this word-processing field.
 The routine WVRADWP was modified to fix this problem.
  
 Associated NOIS: None. Problem was pointed out in FORUM message 28733077
                  (Response #18).
  
 6) Duplicate radiology exams created.
  
 A user entered a screening mammogram procedure in the WH package via the
 Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW PROCEDURE] option before it was
 performed and verified in the Radiology/NM package. When the Radiology
 report was verified, the WH package created a second mammogram procedure
 entry in the WV PROCEDURE file (#790.1) without checking to see if a
 procedure already existed which could be linked to the Radiology/NM
 package entry. A new routine, WVRALIN1, and an existing routine, WVRALINK,
 now check for a WH PROCEDURE file (#790.1) entry to match with a new entry
 being added to the package by the link to the Radiology/NM package. All
 procedures being added by the Radiology/NM link will be checked against
 existing procedures in FILE 790.1 which have no link to a Radiology/NM
 package entry. If the patient, procedure and procedure date are the same,
 the incoming procedure from the Radiology/NM package will be linked to the
 existing FILE 790.1 entry to prevent a duplicate entry.
  
 Associated NOIS: GNH-0199-40726
  
 7) Users need to see Lab package results for tests performed.
  
 The WH software package needs a way to link Lab package entries with WH
 package entries to view results of tests performed and to link WH
 procedures with specific lab test results. That link is not currently
 available. A new option, Health Summary [WV HS-USER DEFINED], has been
 added to the Patient Management [WV MENU-PATIENT MANAGEMENT] menu so users
 can invoke the adhoc report functionality of the Health Summary package to
 view data from other packages such as the Lab package. Users can select
 one or more Health Summary package components to create a report. The
 Cytology (CY) and Surgical Pathology (SP) components will display lab data
 of particular interest to WH users. A new routine, WVHS, was added to call
 an entry point in the Health Summary package to display the Health Summary
 output.
  
 The routine WVUTL5 was modified to not print a double line of dashes in
 the menu header so all the menu options could fit on one terminal screen.
  
 Associated NOIS: None.
