Subject: PATIENT ADDRESS CHANGES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 The Deputy Undersecretary for Health for Operations and Management (10N) 
 convened a task force in April 2002 to review the controlled substance 
 process in VHA. The task force returned several recommendations. One of 
 the recommendations was to modify Outpatient Pharmacy 7.0 to provide a
 record of all address changes.
  
 Medical Center Pharmacy Managers are encouraged to contact their IRM and 
 arrange the regular auditing of changes to address and temporary address 
 fields in the PATIENT file (#2). Pharmacy Managers should monitor these
 audits to discover and correct any patterns of inappropriate address
 changes. An option created with this patch will facilitate the review of
 the audits.
  
 Audits consume disk space on the VISTA system so audit results cannot be 
 stored indefinitely. Pharmacy Managers should negotiate a timeframe for 
 the regular review of the audits so that the audits can be purged from 
 the system when no longer needed. The suggested fields for auditing are:
  
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1]    (#.111)
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2]    (#.112)
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3]    (#.113)
 CITY                       (#.114)
 STATE                      (#.115)
 ZIP CODE                   (#.116)
 ZIP+4                      (#.1112)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 1]  (#.1211)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 2]  (#.1212)
 TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 3]  (#.1213)
 TEMPORARY CITY             (#.1214)
 TEMPORARY STATE            (#.1215)
 TEMPORARY ZIP CODE         (#.1216)
 TEMPORARY ZIP+4            (#.12112)
  
  
 The new Patient Address Changes Report [PSO ADDRESS CHANGE REPORT] option
 is exported with this patch and will be placed under the Supervisor
 Functions [PSO SUPERVISOR] option. This option prints a report that shows
 changes made to the various address fields listed above from the PATIENT
 file (#2), over the date range specified. The report can be run for one
 patient, or for all patients. A field can only be tracked and shown on
 this report if the VA FileMan AUDIT function was turned on for the field
 at the time the field was edited.
