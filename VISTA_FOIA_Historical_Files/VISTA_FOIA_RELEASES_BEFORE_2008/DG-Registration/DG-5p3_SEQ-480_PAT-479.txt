  ISSUE #2: The following change for Patient Data Review [VAFC
  EXCEPTION HANDLER] has been authorized by Elizabeth Franchi,
  Information Assurance, Data Quality Coordinator, VHA.
   
  Due to the potential of a Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR)
  site accepting an old address without review, the Patient Data
  Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER] option will discontinue sending
  address information due to duplication with the Health Eligibility
  Center (HEC) data updates.
   
  The following fields can no longer be displayed or merged in
  Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER].

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*479).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*479.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  Place the following options out of
      order.
                Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER]
                Message Exception Menu ... [RG EXCEPTION MENU]
      
  8.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, return them to the
      mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
       
  9.  Routine DG479PRE will be automatically deleted from your system
      after successful installation of the patch.
