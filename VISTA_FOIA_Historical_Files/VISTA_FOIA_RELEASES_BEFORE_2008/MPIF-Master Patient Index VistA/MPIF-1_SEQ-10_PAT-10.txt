Description: 
============

  Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
  release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
  installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
  Implementation Manager for CIRN.
  
  ISSUE 1:  The CIRN Developers has asked that Local ICNs be assigned when
  an exception happens during the initial load to the MPI.  This has been
  done in routines MPIFBT2 and MPIFBT3.
  
  ISSUE 2:  In order to keep the number of repeating Local ICNs being sent
  to the MPI for resolution when their is still an exception outstanding,
  the Local/Missing ICN Resolution job will no longer send up patients
  that have a Potential Match Exception.  The only way that a potential 
  match patient can get an ICN assignment would be via the Single Patient
  Initialization Option, so there is no need to send them up during the
  background job.  Routine MPIFRES has this change.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
  
    2.  Be sure that the [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] Local/Missing ICN
        Resolution Background Job is not running or scheduled to run during
        the install.  If it is, unschedule the job.
   
    3.  Stop Inbound HL7 filer(s) via the "Monitor, Start, Stop Filers"
        option on the "Filer and Link Management" menu which can be found
        on the "HL7 Main Menu".  
   
    4.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    5.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    6.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    7.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
   
    8.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
    9.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*10.
   
    10. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes
  
         [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]     Local/Missing ICN Resolution 
                                      Background Job
  
   
    11.  Restart the HL7 Inbound filer(s) via the same options in step #3.
  
    12.  If you unscheduled the MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES job in step #2,
         reschedule it to run tonight between 10pm and 4am.
