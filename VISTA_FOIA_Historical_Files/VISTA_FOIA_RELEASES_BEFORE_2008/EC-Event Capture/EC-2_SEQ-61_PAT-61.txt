Description:
============

 The following changes were identified by Bedford Decision Support Office (DSO)
 for addition to the Event Capture product for FY05.
    
 1) Create a new report option entitled "Records Failing Transmission to PCE 
    Report" on the Event Capture Report Menu.  This report will assist in 
    locating encounters that have not been sent to PCE.
   
 a. Technical
    o  A new routine ECNTPCE was created to generate the report.
    o  Routines ECRRPC and  ECRRPT1 were updated to handle the new report 
       from within the EC GUI application.
    o  Option [EC NTPCE REPORT] 'Records Failing Transmission to PCE 
       Report' was added as a new option in the Option file #19.
    o  Option [EC NTPCE REPORT] was added as an option under the 'Event 
       Capture Reports [ECREPS]' menu.
    o  Help frame EC NTPCE was added.
    o  GUI routine UfrmSelectReport was modified.
   
 b. Functional
    The new menu option will be selectable from the Report Menu.  Below is 
    an example from the VistA roll-n-scroll menu.
           Patient Summary - Event Capture
           DSS Unit Workload Summary
           Provider Summary Report
           Ordering Section Summary Report
           Provider (1-3) Summary Report
           PCE Data Summary
           Inactive Person Class Report
           Procedure Reason Report
           Records Failing Transmission to PCE Report
  
   Select Event Capture Reports Option: Records Failing Transmission to PCE 
    Report
   
   Start with Date:  1/1/91  (JAN 01, 1991)
   End with Date:  T  (FEB 12, 2004)

 2) Develop a solution that will prevent duplicate ECS GUI spreadsheet 
    records uploaded from being added to the Event Capture patient file.
 
    NOIS
    MEM-1103-70960  Create option/tool to remove uploaded duplicate
 
 a. Technical
    o  Routines ECU1RPC, ECV1RPC and ECV3RPC were modified to check for the 
       presence of duplicate records.
    o  EC GUI 'mainspread' was updated.
    o  The version number for the option 'EC GUI Context' was changed from 
       2.0.10.1 to 2.0.11.0 to reflect a version upgrade.
   
 b. Functional
    o  The message 'Continue', 'Change' or 'Abort' is displayed when 10
       duplicate records have been found.  
       - Continue: resets the counter and resumes processing of records.
       - Change:   allows user to change the user-defined threshold value.
       - Abort:    terminates the upload process.    
       When all records have been processed, if any duplicates exist then the 
       user is prompted with a 'File Duplicate Record(s)' check box.  Checking 
       the box files the duplicate records in the Event Capture Patient 
       file #721.
    
       NOTE: The user has the option of changing the Duplicate Threshold 
             default value from 10 to a user-defined number. The Duplicate 
             Threshold value can be changed two ways:
             o through the "Spreadsheet Options" menu, "Change Duplicate 
               Threshold" option, OR
             o when the threshold is reached and the Threshold Reached 
               window displayed, click the "Change" button.

 NOP-0204-12267  Ecs Gui Provider 1-3 Sum Rpt Error
 Problem: Site reported when reviewing information from the Provider (1-3) 
 Summary report they discovered workload being displayed on the holiday (1/1/04) 
 for an employee that didn't work. The information displayed in this report 
 could not be verified by the other reports for the same date (Patient Summary
 report; Provider Summary report or Ordering Section Summary report).
   
 Resolution: To pull the appropriate records for this report required
 manipulating the start and end dates.  Found that these dates were already 
 being manipulated in routines ECRRPT and ECPRSUM1. The corrective action
 was to remove the date manipulation from routine ECRRPT1.
   
   
 BAY-1004-31049  Provider 1-3 Report post EC*63 (CTD) installation
 Site reported that Provider (1-3) Summary report no longer prints the CPT 
 code as part of the procedure description display.
 
 Resolution: Routine ECPRSUM1 was modified to add CPT variable to part of 
 procedure description.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*61):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EC*2.0*61.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
     you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
         EC GUI Context version 2.0.10.1 ...        [EC GUI CONTEXT]
         Event Capture Reports ...                  [ECREPS]
  
 7.  If a routine was unmapped as part of step 2, it should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
