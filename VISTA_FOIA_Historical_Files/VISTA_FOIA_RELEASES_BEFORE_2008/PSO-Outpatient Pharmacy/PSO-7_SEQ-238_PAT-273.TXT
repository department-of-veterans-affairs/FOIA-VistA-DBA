Associated patches: (v)PSO*7*267   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*273'

Subject: Encapsulation Follow-up

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch enhances the functionality of the PSO59 routine.
  
 PSO59 retrieves data from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and has three 
 parameters: PSOIEN (optional), PSOTXT (optional), and LIST (required).  
 While PSOIEN and PSOTXT are both labeled as optional, PSO59 requires that 
 either parameter be passed in or no data will be returned.  PSOIEN is the 
 internal entry number (IEN) of a site, PSOTXT is a free text entry that 
 works as a search parameter, and LIST is the subscript name used in the 
 ^TMP global.  This routine will now return field values for the NPI 
 INSTITUTION field (#101) and NCPDP NUMBER field (#1008) from the 
 OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
  
 Please refer to DBIA 4827 for further description on PSO59.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch exports a routine that is a supported reference, so any other
 Vista application can make a call to this routine. For that reason, it is
 recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a
 minimum.
     
 Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
      
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
      
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
       Installation menu.
      
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*273)
      
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
      
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
     
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package   
       PSO*7.0*273.
      
    5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//" respond NO.
      
    6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
      
    7. When prompted "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and 
       DO NOT queue this to P-Message.
     
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
     
    (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
    download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
    available FTP server.
     
    (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
    from a specific server as follows:
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
    The documentation includes:
    
     FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
     PHAR_1_API_R0807.PDF             Pharmacy Re-Engineering API Manual
   
    Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA Documentation
    Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
    http://www.va.gov/vdl
