Subject: DATA CLEANSING REPORTS FOR 6914.2 FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch exports a series of reports that will be used to prepare the
 data in the AEMS/MERS PM PROCEDURES (#6914.2) file for conversion to 
 the CoreFLS system.
    
 This patch adds a new menu option, PM Procedures - 6914.2 [ENH PM
 PROCEDURES], to the CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing Reports [ENH DATA
 CLEANSING] menu. This menu option requires the security key ENH DATA
 CLEANSING and contains the following options:
     Summary Report [ENH 6914.2 SUMMARY REPORT]
     Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6914.2 REQUIRED RPT]
     Lookup Fields w/ Invalid Data Report - N/A [ENH 6914.2 LOOKUP RPT]
     Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6914.2 NON-REQUIRED RPT]
    
  The reports examine the following two fields: 
     PROCEDURE TITLE (#1)
     TEXT (#3)
  
 If any field is empty, it is included on one of the reports.
  
 This patch includes four reports, one summary and three detailed:
  
 1.  Summary Report - lists all the fields examined and a count of how 
     many times each field is empty.
  
 2.  Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each required field in 
     the PM PROCEDURES (#6914.2) file that is empty. (A field is defined
     as required when the empty field causes functionality problems for
     CoreFLS.)
  
 3.  Lookup Fields with Invalid Data Report - does not apply to this file 
     but is being exported for consistency with other Data Cleansing
     options.
  
 4.  Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each non-required
     field in the PM PROCEDURES (#6914.2) file that is empty. Because the
     fields are not required, they may be left empty, but populating these
     fields with data will improve functionality after conversion to
     CoreFLS.
