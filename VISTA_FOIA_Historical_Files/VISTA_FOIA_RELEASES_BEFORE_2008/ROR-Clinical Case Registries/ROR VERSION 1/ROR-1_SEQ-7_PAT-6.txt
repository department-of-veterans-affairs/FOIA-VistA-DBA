Description:
============

 This patch fixes problems discovered during the implementation of the
 Immunology Case Registry (ICR) in the Clinical Case Registries (CCR)
 framework.  A new version of the CCR GUI (1.0.6.3) is being released with
 this patch.
  
 CCR:ICR documentation was originally distributed with the patch ROR*1.0*5
 as ROR1_0P5DOC.ZIP.  The documentation files have been updated to remain
 consistent with the functionality of the software and the file is named
 the same in order to provide the most current documentation to the user in
 a single file.  Each file in ROR1_0P5DOC.ZIP contains a Revision History
 table, which documents the versioning of the document.
  
 The fixes and enhancements can be separated into two groups: M code and
 GUI changes.
  
 M Code
 ------
  
 [01] %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable DFLTSITE
      -----------------------------------------
  
 Data extraction task crashed at LABPROC+18^ROREXT02 due to the undefined 
 DFLTSITE variable.  The ROREXT02 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS references for this problem are ALB-0404-50689, BHS-0404-10660, 
 ELP-0904-71062, LOM-0404-61948, MIW-0404-40866, and OKL-0304-71707.
  
 [02] 'NOT DETECTED' seen as positive result
      --------------------------------------
  
 The NOT DETECTED value was treated as a positive lab result by the 
 registry update process.  The RORUPD04 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is AMA-0604-70199.
  
 [03] ERROR IN POINTER RESOLUTION OF DATA
      -----------------------------------
  
 The 'Unable to find exact match and resolve pointer (^ORD(101, Entry:
 RORICR-SITE-DRIVER).' message was displayed during the installation of the
 patch ROR*1*5.  This had been expected and the problem was fixed by the 
 post-install code.  However, the message confused some users.
  
 The PROTOCOL field (13) of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1) has
 been cleared in the development account so that this error message will
 not appear again when the data is exported to the sites.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is BHS-0304-10753.
  
 [04] Registry setup was not suspended
      --------------------------------
  
 Some assumptions regarding the "intelligence" of the registry update 
 process appeared to be wrong in regards to the registry setup at small 
 sites.  If the PATIENT file (#2) contained less than 100,000 records then
 only a single task was always scheduled and thus the task suspension was
 not possible.
  
 The RORUPD05 routine has been amended.  The threshold value has been 
 changed from 100,000 to 10,000.  Moreover, it will be possible to suspend
 even a single task after installation of this patch.
  
 The NOIS references for this problem are NHM-0304-11058 and 
 SHE-0304-51339.
  
 [05] Ethnicity column and summary tables
      -----------------------------------
  
 The ethnicity column and some summary tables were missing from the General
 Utilization report.  The RORX003 and RORX003A routines have been amended.
 The XSL templates stored in the dialogs #7981003.001, #7981003.002,
 #7981997.001, and #7981997.002 (see the DIALOG file (#.84) for details)
 have been updated also.
  
 The NOIS references for this problem are PAL-0304-60871 and 
 PAL-0304-60872.
  
 [06] Not transmitting ICD9 codes for problems
      ----------------------------------------
  
 Sometimes the ICD-9 codes associated with the patient problems were not
 transmitted due to invalid characters ('~') appended to the values stored 
 in the DIAGNOSIS field (.01) of the PROBLEM file (#9000011).
  
 The RORHL17 routine has been amended to explicitly convert the value to a
 number before using it as the IEN of the record of the IDC DIAGNOSIS file
 (#80).
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-60876.
  
 [07] Updated problems were transmitted several times
      -----------------------------------------------
  
 Updated problems from the problem list were transmitted more than once.  
 The RORHL17 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-60878.
  
 [08] Patch number included a sequence number
      ---------------------------------------
  
 Patch number in the CSR-1 field of the HL7 message erroneously included
 the patch sequence number as well. The ROREXPR routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0404-61198.
  
 [09] Incorrect age calculation
      -------------------------
  
 Age of deceased patients was calculated incorrectly in the General
 Utilization report.  The RORX003A routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0504-61756.
  
 [10] IEN instead of a Stop Code
      --------------------------
  
 IENs of stop codes were sent in the outpatient pharmacy OBX segments
 instead of the stop codes themselves. The RORHL031, RORHL09, and RORUTL18
 routines have been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is SPO-0404-50850.
  
 [11] Provider Class 
      --------------
  
 IENs of the provider classes were sent in the HL7 messages.  But the 
 PROVIDER CLASS file (#7) is a locally edited file and IENs of the provider
 classes are site-specific.  The RORHL03, RORHL04, RORHL07, RORHL071,  
 RORHL09, RORHL14, and RORHL17 routines have been amended to send provider
 class name instead of IEN.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-60727.
  
 [12] Stray node(s) in the Data Dictionary
      ------------------------------------
  
 A stray "PT" node was discovered in the data dictionary of the ROR 
 REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1) at Albuquerque:
 ^DD(798.1,0,"PT",799.12,.03).  It appeared that all sites had this node as
 a result of deleting/moving the file #799.12 by one of the patches (most 
 probably, the ROR*1*3).  It looked like the FileMan API (EN^DIU2) did not
 delete the reference when the file was deleted.
  
 The IRM personnel has been advised to run the Check/Fix DD Structure
 option of the Data Dictionary Utilities menu (see the step #2 of the patch
 installation instructions).
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is ALB-0604-51312.
  
 [13] Patient IEN (DFN) in the logs
      -----------------------------
  
 Patient IEN (DFN) was not displayed in the output of the Print Log Files 
 [RORMNT PRINT LOGS] option.  It was difficult to find a patient in
 question using only the patient name.
  
 The ROR LOG print template has been amended to print the DFN (in 
 parenthesis) after the patient name.
  
 The E3R reference for this enhancement is #18971.
  
 [14] Resend the registry information message
      ---------------------------------------
  
 The patch post-install code resends the registry information e-mail (the 
 one that was originally sent after the registry setup had completed).  The
 original e-mail had incorrect coded SSNs in the list of pending patients.
  
 The RORUTL17 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0804-61367.
  
 [15] Pseudo-patient and number of pending patients
      ---------------------------------------------
  
 The following changes of the data extraction will be in effect for all
 registries after the patch 6 installation:
  
  * The batch HL7 message will be sent every night (even if there is
    no new data available);
  
  * The first individual message in the batch will represent a
    pseudo-patient.  The message will contain a current number of
    pending patients in the registry in the second component of the
    CSR-4 segment (E3R #18891).  The first components of the PID-3
    and CSR-4 will be zeros for the pseudo-patient.
  
    At the same time the pseudo-patient message will guarantee that
    the batch is not empty (the VistA does not transmit empty batch
    HL7 messages).
  
  * Individual messages in the HL7 batches sent from the test sites
    will contain a patch build number in the 4th sub-component of 
    the 3rd component of the CSR-1 (e.g. 'VA ICR^VA^ROR&1.0&7&2').
  
 [16] List of Hep C NDC codes
      -----------------------
 The following National Drug Codes (NDC) have been added to the DRUG
 THERAPY LIST multiple (17) of the Hepatitis C (Hep C) registry parameters
 record in the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1):
  
 000004035239, 000004201607, 000004201609, 000004201707,

 064116003924
            
 The following NDC codes have been removed from the list:
  
 000004035639, 000004198701, 000004198709, 000004200909,

 055513092706, 999999777701, 999999999999
  
 The NOIS reference for this update is PHI-0204-20591.
  
 [17] Old patch routines
      ------------------
  
 The following old patch routines (post- and pre-install ones) are deleted
 by this patch: RORP003, RORP004, RORP005, and RORP005B.
  
  
 CCR GUI
 -------
  
 [01] "Registry" tab access in the GUI
      --------------------------------
  
 In some cases users without the ROR VA ICR ADMIN security key still had
 access to the Registry tab of the CCR GUI.  After selecting another tab
 the Registry tab finally disappeared.  The GUI code has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is HAM-0304-22240.
  
 [02] Clinical AIDS label confusing, change to AIDS OI
      ------------------------------------------------
  
 By request from the Center for Quality Management (CQM) group the
 'Clinical AIDS' label on the 'Current Status' tab of the 'Patient Data
 Editor' dialog box has been replaced with the following text: 'Check if
 patient ever had an AIDS OI'.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-61644.
  
 [03] Current Status tab of Patient Data Editor change
      ------------------------------------------------
  
 By request from the CQM group the 'CD4/Viral Search results' label on the
 'Current Status' tab of the 'Patient Data Editor' dialog box has been
 replaced with the following text: 'CD4/HIV Search Results'.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-61649.
  
 [04] GUI form does not fit 800x600 screen
      ------------------------------------
  
 The 'ICR Reports' dialog box did not entirely fit the screen in 800x600
 resolution if the Windows taskbar was not set up to auto-hide.  The code
 has been amended so that the dialog box will fit the screen and the
 content can be scrolled.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0504-61757.
  
 [05] Investigational Drugs label confusing
      -------------------------------------
  
 By request from the CQM group the 'Investigational Drugs' label on the
 'ICR Reports' dialog box has been replaced with the following text:
 'Investigational Drugs (registry specific)'.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0304-61886.
  
 [06] Mismatched links in the GUI help file
      -------------------------------------
  
 The 'Setting Up ICR Site Parameters' item of the content tree referenced
 the 'Working with Activity Logs' topic.  On the other hand, the 'Working
 with Activity Logs' item of the content tree referenced the 'Setting Up
 ICR Site Parameters' topic.  The online help file has been corrected.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is SDC-0404-60545.
  
 [07] Blank window when GUI is started
      --------------------------------
  
 Some users were confused by the empty main window after starting the CCR
 GUI.  The code has been modified to display a registry selection dialog
 (when the HepC registry functionality is added).  If the user has security
 key(s) only for a single registry, this registry will be opened 
 automatically.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0804-61368.
  
 [08] Month/Year fields of CDC from did not accept year 2000
      ------------------------------------------------------
  
 The validation code of the Month/Year fields of the CDC (Center for
 Disease Control and Prevention) form did not allow entering '00' (year
 2000) in the year part of the fields.  The code has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0604-62149.
  
 [09] Mismatched field values on the CDC form
      ---------------------------------------
  
 Even if the date of death (Section III of the CDC form) had already been
 entered, it was not possible to enter the state/territory of death.  When
 the form was saved, the state of death was listed as the date of death and
 could not be changed.
  
 The code of the GUI and definition of the CDC form (the ICRCDCDEF instance
 of the ROR GUI PARAMETER parameter) have been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PAL-0804-61370.
