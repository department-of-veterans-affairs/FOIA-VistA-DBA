Subject: MISLEADING OPTION HELP TEXT/MISPELLED VARIABLE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses NOIS related issues on the Fiscal Pending 
 Action report (HEH-1101-41068), and the misspelling of the PRC("PARAM")
 array (ISW-0603-22178).
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1. HEH-1101-41068  Fiscal Pending Action Rpt
 2. ISW-0603-22178  PRCHE1 reference to PRC('PRARAM') not PRC('PARAM')
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. HEH-1101-41068  Fiscal Pending Action Rpt
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The help text for the Fiscal Pending Action [PRCB RPT FISCAL PENDING
 ACTION] option states:
  
 'This option will print all 1358, Amendment and P.O. transactions with a
  status of Pending Fiscal Action'
  
 During processing, the report routine, PRCB2A, pulls all POs with a Fiscal
 status of 10, 15, or 20, which equates to a Supply Status of 10 (Pending
 Fiscal Action), 28 (Partial Received but not Obligated), and 33 (Complete
 Order Received but not Oblig). Then, it looks at the 'AD' cross-reference
 of the FUND CONTROL POINT file (#420), to pull the control points marked
 as General Post Fund control points. It uses those control points to loop
 through the 'AN' cross-reference of the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file
 (#410), and find the IEN of transactions with that particular control
 point. Because it appears to be pulling transactions for that one control
 point, and no others, the above help text is misleading.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Fiscal Pending Action [PRCB RPT FISCAL PENDING ACTION] option will 
 contain the following help text.
  
 'This option will print all Purchase Orders with a status of Pending 
  Fiscal Action. It will also print all General Post Fund 2237s and 1358s 
  with a status of Pending Fiscal Action.'
  
  
 2. ISW-0603-22178  PRCHE1 reference to PRC('PRARAM') not PRC('PARAM')
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In routine PRCHE1, the line I '$D(PRC("PRARAM")) D  Q:'% at line tag VEDIT
 contains the typo PRARAM. The correct spelling for this PRC array variable
 is PARAM. PRC("PARAM") is defined by a call to the routine PRCFSITE, and
 is described in the IFCAP 5.1 technical manual as containing site
 parameters from global node ^PRC(411,Site,0).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch contains a modified version of routine PRCHE1 with the
 correctly spelled PRC array variable.
