Description:
============

 GUI Version 24 introduces the ability to document Herbal, Over-the-Counter
 (OTC) and Non-VA medications.  Non-VA meds are those dispensed outside the
 VA system.
  
 -- ALLERGY/ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING
  
 - Entry of free-text causative agents will no longer be allowed.  Users 
 will be instructed to try alternate spellings or names, or to contact 
 their allergy coordinator for assistance.  If patch GMRA*4.0*17 is 
 installed, an option will be provided to automatically send a bulletin to
 a local allergy mail group to have the new item added to the GMR ALLERGIES
 file for future selection. (HWH-0103-41841)
  
 - The DRUG INGREDIENTS and DRUG CLASS files have been moved farther down 
 the list of files containing matching causative agent search terms, in 
 order to encourage users to select from other files first (VA Allergies,
 National and Local Drug) in order to enable the best potential for order 
 checking.
  
 - If the user clicked "Cancel" on the allergy lookup screen, the next 
 screen displayed was the allergy entry dialog instead of a proper 
 cancellation out of the action. This has been fixed. 
  
  
 -- SURGERY TAB
  
 - All remote procedure calls related to the display of the Surgery case's 
 "OpTop" have now been removed.
  
 -- ICD9 CODES 
  
 - The Detailed Order display lists the ICD-9 codes and SC/EI 
 information for each order for which they were defined.  This 
 functionality was added.
  
 -- SERVER ALLOCATION ERRORS 
  
 - NOIS: BAY-0903-30560, CHA-0603-31953 - If a user set a broad date range
 for displaying active medication orders on the MEDS tab, server side
 allocation errors might occur.  This functionality has been returned to
 its former state with "ORCH CONTEXT MEDS" settings.
  
 -- CCOW
  
 - NOIS: MIN-0204-42074 - A problem was reported in v22 and v23 related to 
 the user's last and/or initial tab settings not being respected on a 
 change of patient. 
  
  
 -- ORDERS
  
 - New options have been added to the Clinical Coordinator's GUI 
 Parameters menu:

 -          RE     GUI Report Parameters ...
 -          NV     GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons
 -          EX     GUI Expired Orders Search Hours
 -          RM     GUI Remove Button Enabled 
  
 - GUI Non-VA Med Statements/Reasons: Allows the sites to determine which 
 statements/reasons are displayed at the system or division level.
  
 - GUI Expired Orders Search Hours: Allows sites to determine how many 
 hours back in time to search for expired orders.  These are displayed in 
 the "Recently Expired Orders" view on the Orders tab.  
  
 - GUI Remove Button Enabled: Allows sites to select CPRS-OR 
 notifications/alerts that can be deleted via the Remove button.  This
 option allows sites to determine which CPRS-OR alerts can be deleted
 without processing.  Non-CPRS-OR alerts cannot be deleted via the Remove
 button.
  
 - NOIS: TAM-0803-30773, LOM-1003-60667 - For a long delayed event list, 
 in the event selection box the scroll bar would not scroll down to the 
 very bottom event and it was not viewable. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: SUX-1003-40755 - With 600x800 screen resolution, the OK and 
 Cancel buttons of the Associated Complex Orders Verify Window could not 
 be seen by users. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: ERI-0803-21714 - A quick order created with a schedule containing 
 PRN (i.e. Q8H PRN), when loaded in CPRS the PRN box was checked correctly 
 but the EXPECTED FIRST DOSE administrative time still showed up. This has 
 been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: UNY-0903-10610 - If a procedure quick order contains no service, 
 and more than one service is selectable for that procedure, the service 
 combo box should NOT be disabled.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: UNY-0603-11980, MWV-0302-22601 - When transferring an inpatient
 medication order to outpatient, if the medication's dispense drug name
 differed for inpatient and outpatient, the drug name was pulled into
 dosage in the transferred order.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: BIL-0903-30864 - For personal radiology quick orders, the 
 predefined modifier was not held during the order placing.  This has been 
 fixed.
  
 - NOIS: BOI-1103-50612 - Verifying multiple-day lab orders resulted in a 
 pop-up "Associated Complex Orders" window with the text of "You have 
 requested to verify a medication order which was entered as part of a 
 complex order."  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CHA-1003-30379 - For an outpatient, if you opened an inpatient 
 order dialog, inpatient quick orders were available in the quick order
 list, and they should not have been.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: HAM-1202-22074 - Allows sites to determine how many hours back in 
 time to search for expired orders.  These are displayed in the "Recently 
 Expired Orders" view on the Orders tab.  If no expiring orders are 
 displayed on the follow-up screen for the Meds Expiring alert, users have 
 the ability to view recently expired orders.
  
 -ALERTS / NOTIFICATIONS
  
 - NOIS: HVH-0903-11533 - Patient locations were not displayed in the 
 GUI alert Location column in all possible instances.  Now for all
 inpatients, OR alerts, patient location is displayed in the Location 
 column whenever known. For outpatients, TIU and other alerts, the patient
 location will be blank. (Patient location cannot be determined for these
 alerts.)
  
 - NOIS: MIW-0903-40510 - Addresses a GUI alert display problem when a
 site's lab results included "-----".  The problem caused undefined 
 variable errors.
  
 - NOIS: FAR-0903-41288, MAC-0803-61076, E3R 18405 - The user's last-used 
 sort column should now be stored between patients and sessions.
  
 - NOIS: HUN-0903-22468 - The last four SSN+1 for patients with short 
 names should now be displayed.
  
 - NOIS: MIN-0903-42340, REN-1003-61436 - Locally-developed alerts should 
 no longer be processed as informational alerts.
  
 - Unable to Select Notifications using keyboard - This has been fixed and
 this functionality is now provided.
  
 - Notifications not processing when one or more notifications 
 selected, and the <Enter> key pressed - The <Enter> key now allows for 
 processing of selected Notifications.
  
 - A new procedure was added to allow non-sighted users to sort 
 Notifications using Ctl + <key> combinations, where key = 
 I|i|D|d|L|l|U|u|P|p|M|m|F|f, with each key combination corresponding to a 
 column header in the Notifications box.
  
 - NOIS: HIN-1003-42160 - Removal of action alerts by individuals: 
 1. The Remove button was separated from other buttons on the GUI alert 
 display.
 2. The deletion action of the Remove button was changed so that it only 
 deletes the alert for the current user/recipient.
 3. There is now a New option on Clinical Coordinator's GUI Parameters 
 menu which allows sites to select CPRS-OR notifications/alerts that can 
 be deleted via the Remove button (non-CPRS-OR alerts cannot be deleted 
 via the Remove button.).  The Remove button is located at the bottom 
 right of the patient Selection window.
  
 -- MEDS
  
 - A co-pay column for marking a medication as related to Combat Veteran 
 service has been added.  This will not be active until supporting patches 
 have been installed.
  
 - NOIS: SUX-0103-42343 - The tab key sequence in the medication order 
 dialog is changed to reflect the correct sequence.
  
 - NOIS: ASH-0803-30045 - For a regular medication order with the "Give
 additional dose NOW," CPRS did not allow a provider to order a renewal.
 This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS MON-0603-51257 - When copying an existing medication order to a 
 new order, even if the drug had been deactivated in the order the copy 
 function still was allowed. This problem has been fixed, and a warning 
 message of "The drug had been inactivated" will pop up and the copy 
 action will be halted.
  
 - NOIS: SDC-1203-60379 - In an order set, when placing a DEA required 
 medication, if the user did not have a #DEA, a "list index out of bounds" 
 error occurred.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CAH-0303-30751 - Providers ordering medications have reported 
 problems with Non-Formulary meds.  When a Non Formulary orderable item
 was entered in CPRS and the <Enter> key pressed or OK clicked, 
 occasionally the screen would gray out and the user could not proceed  
 (the "Grey Screen of Death").  This has been fixed. 
  
 - E3R: 16507, 18710, NOIS MIN-0104-41341 - Typing a search term in
 the meds selection box will cause the list to scroll to the first 
 matching entry, but no entry will be automatically selected.  The user 
 will need to either click on the desired entry in the list, or tab to the 
 list and use the down arrow to highlight and select the desired entry.  A 
 conscious selection must be made.  (Auto-selecting if there is only one
 match is a much more complicated solution, and is not included in this
 fix.)  
  
 - NOIS: WIM-0204-21575 - "Outpatient medication order quantity update 
 error." During the ordering process for an Outpatient medication, if a 
 schedule was selected and then changed to a ONE TIME schedule, the 
 quantity was not recalculated correctly.  This was fixed.  With this 
 update, if a one-time schedule or non-standard schedule is selected, the 
 quantity will be reset to zero and the provider will have to enter a 
 valid quantity before the order will be accepted.  
  
 - NOIS: CMS-0503-31313 - When copying a prescription in outpatient 
 pharmacy (using the hidden "copy" option in Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LMBACKDOOR ORDERS]) and accepting and then editing the 
 provider field of the RX, the prescription file was updated but the order 
 file in CPRS was not updated with the correct provider.  This has been 
 fixed so that it no longer occurs.  Corrections to previous order file 
 entries are not done with this patch.
  
 - NOIS: HIN-0800-42602 - When placing a "PSO SUPPLY" order the outpatient 
 medication order dialog appears, and the user could select regular 
 medications. This has been fixed.  (If a supply quick order were to load 
 the user would not be allowed to select medications.)
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0703-50915 - When entering a medication from the meds tab or 
 the orders tab in the GUI and after the user entered an orderable item 
 name, a pick list is displayed.  If the user wants the first item 
 displayed in the list but rather then clicking on that exact item - 
 inadvertently clicks just above the selection (between the orderable item 
 name and the horizontal bar that separates the pick list from the user's 
 personal quick orders), the medication dialog box opened with the 
 orderable item field populated with the name just above the item they 
 actually wanted.  Since the selection is hidden from the pick list the 
 user may not notice this error, which could lead to a medication 
 misadventure.  The root cause is a weakness in the 3rd party "TlistView" 
 component.  Until the publisher distributes an updated component, to 
 reduce possible medication errors: when mouse-hovering over or clicking 
 on a medication, the medication will be highlighted.
  
 - NOIS: BHS-0803-11189 - Some interface modifications were done, 
 including a fix of the information box disappearing upon changing the 
 dosage.  The initial-position of pop-up box was resting over the order 
 comment field, though the comment was still viewable.  The dosage field 
 will no longer be covered by the pop-up box, which should prevent an 
 unintended dosage change by clicking the edge of the information box.
  
 - Relative sizing on the meds tab was not saving, and selecting a new 
 patient restored the sizing to system defaults.  This has been fixed.  If 
 the patient is an Inpatient then the Inpatient section will be larger 
 than Outpatient section; otherwise the Outpatient section will be larger 
 then Inpatient section.
  
 -- NON VA MEDS ORDERS
  
 - Documentation of herbal, Over-the-Counter (OTC) and Non-VA medications 
 (medications dispensed outside the VA system) can now be accomplished 
 through a special pharmacy ordering dialog.  This group of herbals, OTCs 
 and medications dispensed outside the VA are collectively called "Non-VA 
 Meds".  Documenting Non-VA Meds is accomplished by selecting "Meds, 
 Non-VA" from the Write Order list when entering new orders from the 
 Orders tab.  Non-VA Meds do not require an electronic signature.  Once 
 "ordered", Non-VA Meds appear under a separate heading on the Orders and 
 Meds tabs.  Order checking will occur for Non-VA Meds.
  
 - GUI 24 addresses the following E3Rs: #14953, #14954, #15886, #16979.
  
 - New Parameter: OR OREMAS NON-VA MED ORDERS has been added. This 
 parameter determines if clerks (i.e. users holding the OREMAS key) are 
 allowed to enter Non-VA med orders.  Enter YES to permit a clerk to 
 enter new or DC Non-VA med orders and release them to the Pharmacy. Enter 
 UNRELEASED ONLY to restrict clerks to only entering unreleased orders. To 
 prohibit clerks from handling Non-VA med orders entirely, select NO.  
 Parameter is set via the Clinical Coordinators Miscellaneous Parameters

 - EVENT DELAYED ORDERS
  
 -- NOIS: NOL-0903-70631, TAM-0803-31743 - For an outpatient, the "manual 
 release" type event delayed outpatient order could not be manually 
 released.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: SFC-0204-60917 - On the "Release Orders" form, the last event was 
 cut off and the user could not see it.  This has been fixed.
  
 - The OK and Cancel buttons did not appear on the "Release orders to 
 service" dialog box when 10pt or larger fonts were used. This has been 
 corrected and the buttons should reposition themselves correctly for other
 fonts/window sizes.
  
 -- PROCEDURE ORDERS & CONSULTS
  
 - NOIS: ALB-0204-50425, MAC-0104-61043 - The "Reason for Request" entry 
 box was not resizing properly, causing it not to be visible at times.  
 This has been corrected.
  
 - The Inpatient/Outpatient radio buttons on the New Procedure dialog have 
 been put into a group box to prevent the user from being able to use an 
 arrow key to move off the group.  The user should now find it necessary 
 to use the <Tab> key to leave the group box.  <Arrow> keys should take 
 the user from one radio button to another within the group box.
  
 - Inpatient/Outpatient radio buttons on the new consult and new 
 procedure dialogs were fixed so that they remain visible inside their
 parent group box for all font sizes.
  
 -- NOTES & TIU
  
 - Previously, version 23 of the GUI (v23.9 and above) disabled the "New 
 Note" button as soon as it was clicked, to prevent multiple clicks that 
 resulted in a variety of errors, including signed blank notes.  This 
 version contains additional logic to prevent this from happening 
 via other combinations of clicks (menu, then button, EDIT then NEW, 
 ADDENDUM then NEW, etc).  It should no longer be possible to reach a 
 situation where two notes are both in progress in the treeview at the 
 same time.
  
 - JAWS now reads Drawers Buttons as a button.  For this to work you must
 use JAWS 5.0 and have the included CPRS JAWS Configuration file(s).
  
 - It is no longer possible to drag a note in the treeview at the same 
 time that any note is being edited.  Doing so could lead to a situation 
 where two "New Note in Progress" nodes could appear in the treeview, 
 which could in turn lead to one of those notes being signed though 
 containing no text.
  
 - Autosave: A minor bug, which could occur rarely but which could have
 serious consequences, was found and corrected:  If the total length of a
 TIU document was an exact multiple of 300 lines, there was a possibility
 that some of that document's text might not be saved.  (Other documents
 were not affected.)
  
 -- REVIEW/SIGN CHANGES
  
 - A co-pay column for marking a medication as related to Combat Veteran 
 service has been added.  This will not be active until supporting patches 
 have been installed.
  
 - NOIS: LEB-1003-20996, TAM-0903-30555, LEX-1003-40596 - If changing 
 via a notification, the encounter-related items on this screen were not
 being properly cleared as they are when changing patients via a new
 patient selection.  This has been corrected. 
  
 -- NOTES/ DISCHARGE SUMMARIES
 - NOIS: RIC-0304-21569, When clicking the CHANGE button while editing an 
 existing document, it was possible for the AUTHOR or COSIGNER/ATTENDING 
 combo box to appear without the currently defined entry. This has been 
 fixed.
  
 -- PATIENT BAR RDV LIST BOX
  
 - The RDV List box all sites selection now selects all the other sites 
 correctly when the spacebar is pressed. 
  
 -- PROBLEMS TAB
  
 - Recent Code Set Versioning changes resulted in the disallowance of 
 changing an existing problem to a free-text or 799.9 entry.  Entry of new 
 free-text problems continued to be allowed.  This discrepancy has been 
 corrected.
  
 - CHANGE/NEW PROBLEM Screen - The radio button <unknown> under the
 IMMEDIACY section is now spoken correctly. For this to work you must use
 JAWS 5.0 and have the included CPRS JAWS Configuration file(s).
  
 -- TEMPLATES / TEMPLATE EDITOR
  
 - A problem was reported where reloading boilerplate text 
 was working correctly on the Notes tab, but not on the Consults, Surgery, 
 Discharge Summary TIU-related tabs.
 This was happening after selecting the "Change" button and reselecting the
 same title, then attempting to reload boilerplate text. 
 The message "There is no boilerplate assigned to this title" was 
 displayed to the user.  This has been corrected so that all four tabs now 
 work correctly in that scenario.
  
 - NOIS: ASH-0803-30980 - A modification was made to change the height of 
 the template dialog window back to what it was in version 20.  
  
 - The Graphics on the Template Editor Dialog now speak meaningful text
 with JAWS.  For this to work you must use JAWS 5.0 and have the included
 CPRS JAWS Configuration file(s).
  
 -- PATIENT SELECTION SCREEN
  
 - NOIS: CLA-0304-21070 - Changed the display when the source of the 
 patient list is a "clinic" source so that a second column (duplicated 
 names except in the case of "-Alias" listing) of the patient names no 
 longer displays in the lower portion of the selection listbox.
  
 -- ENCOUNTERS, ENCOUNTER FORM
  
 - A Combat Veteran Related service connection category was added to the 
 encounter form.  This will not be active until supporting patches have 
 been installed.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0702-51422 - When a diagnosis was selected via the Problem 
 List section, the "Add to Problem List" checkbox remained enabled for 
 that item.   In this version, the checkbox will only be enabled if any 
 item in the currently highlighted list was NOT selected via the Problem 
 List.  Clicking the checkbox will now only display "Add" next to those 
 items which were selected by other means.
  
 - NOIS: PAL-1003-61241, PUG-0503-50095 - Users were receiving access 
 violations when clicking the encounter button more than once.  A fix was 
 made to disable the button after the first click.  The button is then 
 re-enabled when the encounter form is closed.  This fix was added to the 
 Notes, Consults, D/C Summ and Surgery tabs.
  
 - Provider & Location For Current Activities form - The Encounter 
 Location edit box was not updated with the correct encounter when a 
 Clinic Appointment/Visit was highlighted and the <Enter> key was 
 pressed.  Previously the user had to highlight the Clinic 
 Appointment/Visit and then press the spacebar (this caused the Encounter 
 Location editbox to be updated); then they could close the form and the 
 correct encounter was shown on the CPRS header bar.  The Encounter 
 Location edit box is now automatically updated when the Clinic 
 Appointment/Visit is highlighted and the <Enter> key is pressed.
  
 -- EVENT CAPTURE INTERFACE
  
 - NOIS: BIR-0703-31839, LIT-1203-70083 - For an inpatient, the date/time 
 passed to the ECS application in the CPRS Event Capture Interface 
 defaulted to the patient admission date instead of the current date. This 
 has been fixed.
  
 -- CLINICAL REMINDERS
  
 - Visit Dialog - A Combat Veteran Related service connection category was 
 added.  This will not be active until supporting patches have been 
 installed.
  
 - Before CPRS 22 the Reminder Dialog stored the dialog text on the first 
 load. With CPRS 22, the Reminder Dialog was changed to not store the 
 dialog text. This meant that dialogs were reloading every time a user 
 clicked on a dialog.  This change was made for the WH\CPRS Integration 
 project in GUI 24 to look for a flag to determine if CPRS should store 
 the dialog text.  If this flag is not found, the dialog text will be 
 stored; if the flag is found, the dialog text will not be stored.  This 
 new flag is currently assigned to two reminders that are in test and will 
 not be released until after Clinical Reminders version 2.0 is released.
  
 - This version has new code that will make a Mental Health test required
 in a Reminder Dialog. Clinical Reminders v2.0 must be installed for this
 functionality to work.
  
 - A "Null Subscript" error was reported on the Clinical Reminders v2.0
 patch tracking message.  This error was received when loading the list of
 Clinical Reminders to be evaluated in CPRS. A minor update to the routine 
 ORQQPX was made to fix this problem.
  
 - NOIS:  DUR-0903-30815 - Some hyperlinks in reminder dialogs were not 
 activating when clicked.  An anomaly was fixed so that this should no 
 longer happen.
  
 - NOIS: TAM-0903-32504 - A problem was identified when processing a 
 reminder dialog that contained a forced value for Primary Diagnosis: 
 The text "Primary Diagnosis" would appear in the progress note 
 when the user finished the dialog.  This problem has been fixed and the 
 text will not be passed to the progress note.
  
 - The Max number of characters for the Comment prompt was changed to 245. 
  
 -- PATIENT RECORD FLAGS
  
 - NOIS: MAC-0903-61494, PHO-0903-60782 - In the patient selection screen 
 when double-clicking to select a patient, a patient record flag box 
 appeared and CPRS went directly to the default tab.  This has been 
 fixed.  There will now be a popup box to display active category I 
 patient flags after the patient is selected.
  
 - NOIS: HIN-1003-40302 - If the selected patient is a sensitive patient, 
 before seeing patient record flag information the user must click on the 
 sensitive patient warning window to proceed.
  
 -- CLINICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (CCOW)
  
 - In previous versions, selecting "File/Refresh Patient" also caused a 
 refresh of the current context, which resulted in other linked 
 applications needing to respond to an unnecessary context change 
 request.  This has been corrected.
  
 -- MISCELLANEOUS
  
 - NOIS: ASH-0803-30739 - OR*3*149 included routines ORWPT that did not 
 have patch 132 in the second line and ORWRA that did not have patch 160 in
 the second line. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: ALB-0204-51496 - "RPC 'ORECS01 GETDIV' is not registered to the 
 'OR CPRS GUI CHART option'" error message.  This RPC was mistakenly 
 omitted at some point. This has been corrected.
  
 - NOIS: CLL-0902-40134, ANC-0803-51943, CPH-0601-41699 - When doing order 
 renewal in CPRS, no order checking was taking place.  This has been fixed.
  
 - JAWS will now read Groupbox titles. For this to work you
 must use JAWS 5.0 and have the included CPRS JAWS Configuration file(s). 
  
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES RESOLVED IN THIS PATCH:
 ============================================
  
 - PSI-03-014 / NOIS: HAM-1202- 22074 - Provider Did Not Receive View Alert
 For Expiring Med.
  
 - PSI-03-038 / NOIS: BHS-0803-11189 - Move the POP-Up Box in the Med

 With the addition of the Non-VA Meds project in CPRS GUI 24, patient 
 care facilities will now have the opportunity to document herbals, 
 over-the-counter medications and medications prescribed outside the VA in 
 CPRS.  The addition of these medications and supplements is expected to 
 have minimal impact on the global growth of the Order file [^OR(100]."

 Possible Class III Software Conflict
  
 Pharmacy developers modified the Outpatient Pharmacy V7.0 application 
 programming interface (API) PSOHCSUM to also return the list of Non-VA 
 Meds for the patient. Other applications may use this API to extract data 
 from the pharmacy files for use with the Health Summary. Some sites 
 identified at least one Class III routine (OMED^AOVTIU) that no longer 
 worked once the new version of the PSOHCSUM API was installed. 
  
 To prevent this problem, you must identify any Class III software used by 
 your site that currently uses this API and make the necessary code 
 modifications to handle the Non-VA Meds list returned. 
  
 You can find a complete description of the fields returned by this API 
 and an example showing what the API returns in the release notes.

 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The "JAWS_Scripts_190.ZIP" file contains configuration files that
 replace the file in "informational" patch OR*3*126.  These configuation
 files will need to be copied to the <JAWS>\SETTINGS\ENU\ file on all
 workstations using JAWS.  JAWS power users will likely want to install 
 and customize these files themselves.  
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
