Subject: OCCURRENCE CODE TABLE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Chief Business Office CBO has requested this patch, as it is
 instrumental in updating the Occurrence Codes and the Occurrence Span
 Codes in the MCCR Utility file 399.1. These codes, as defined by the
 National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC), can be used on bills to
 insurance carriers. If a claim does not contain the correct codes required
 by the insurance company, the claim runs the risk of being rejected.  Such
 as the case where an error message is being generated for one carrier,
 BLUE CROSS & BLUE SHIELD NCA. It has been reported that claims are being
 rejected and error messages sent due to the wrong code on the claim.
 Currently, the codes needed, are not available to the user and must be
 added to the file.
  
 There will be 290 new codes added in all, 6 of which have a specific
 definition, and 284 codes that are reserved for state and national
 assignment. It has been requested to add all of the 'RZD for State and
 National Assignment' codes because sites may be required to utilize these
 codes for specific payers.  Because sites are not able to edit this file
 and need these codes almost immediately when requested by the payer, all
 of the codes will be available for use as needed. Additionally, we have
 abbreviated the word Reserved to 'RZD' as this allows those codes starting
 with 'R' that have specific definitions, to list before the "RZD for State
 and National Assignment' codes.
  
 The following information will be updated  when the new code is added:
  
      .01     NAME
      .02     CODE
      .11     OCCURRENCE CODE
      .16     OCC RELATED TO
      .17     OCCURRENCE SPAN

 ---------------------------------------------------
 WAS-0403-21357  CSA report error in EDI
  
  
 This patch addresses the following E3R(s):

 Overview of NOIS message(s):
 ----------------------------
 WAS-0403-21357  CSA report error in EDI
  
 Problem:
