Run Date: SEP 30, 1999                     Designation: LEX*2*14

Subject: LEXICON UPDATES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1.  This patch includes data updates to the following Lexicon files:
 
      757         MAJOR CONCEPT MAP
      757.001     CONCEPT USAGE
      757.01      EXPRESSIONS
      757.02      CODES
      757.1       SEMANTIC MAP
      757.11      SEMANTIC CLASS
      757.21      SUBSETS
 
 Some ICD9  codes did not have the correct terms in the Lexicon and are 
 corrected in this patch. For NOIS's EKH-0699-40932 and LEX-0799-42519, four 
 V-code changes were made. V72.81, V72.82, and V72.83 were corrected to 
 reflect the proper terms contained in the original ICD9 release.  The three 
 narrative descriptions, previously connected to these codes were added as 
 terms to one code (V82.5).
 For LON-0699-61584  synonyms were expanded and added to existing codes 
 757.0 and 333.82.
 
 2.  Routine LEXAR5 has been updated to comply with the CPT lookup standards 
 using an API (CPT^ICPTCOD).  Before the change a hard-coded lookup of the 
 ^ICPT global was employed.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
  
   1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2*14.
  
       Routine mapping is not recommended for the routines released in this
       patch.
  
       >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
       If you have installed LEX*2*14 into another account, and the
       Lexicon global ^LEX is translated into the current account,
       you may go directly to step 5 of the installation instructions.
  
       It is not necessary to install the data from the global host 
       file LEX_2_P14.GBL more than once per translation.  
  
  
       >>>>>>>  IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<
  
   2)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global does
       not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM exists, you
       will need to kill this global before proceeding.
  
       To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
  
         DSM
  
           K ^LEXM
  
         Open M
  
           The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system wide
           setting, but can be allowed for a particular process using the
           $ZU command.  The command for enabling unsubscripted global
           kills is:
  
             VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
             VAH>K ^LEXM
  
           The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process is
           S X=$ZU(68,28,1), however, halting out of the process and
           creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
  
   3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_P14.GBL.  This
       file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
  
  
         DSM
  
           Use ^%GTI and the input device LEX_2_P14.GBL
  
         Open M
  
           We recommend that the GUI Thin Client be used to restore the
           global.  Be sure to select the VAH namespace in the "Global
           Utilities" window.  Make sure that you select the global host
           file LEX_2_P14.GBL (File / Open) before changing the file
           format.  With the namespace and file selected, change the
           restore file format to VAX DSM.
  
  
  
           Using the GUI utilities will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> error when
           restoring a global saved under DSM  (usually seen when using
           the CHUI %GI utility to restore a DSM global).
  
       The loading of the global should take less than 2 minutes.
  
   4)  Turn journaling off for globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM.
  
         DSM
  
           Use ^%GLOMAN
           For the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
           Select "Change Journaling Capabilities"
           Select "D" for "Disabled"
  
  
  
         Open M
  
           We recommend using the GUI System Operations Utilities.  Select
           the database where the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM reside
           using the Databases tab (to find out where a global resides use
           the GUI global utility directory tab).  Then select the menu
           item Action / Database / Global attributes.  In the Attributes
           and Journaling window, click on the "Globals" button.  Select
           the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM (note the "All Globals" check
           box needs to be unmarked to select a specific global).  Make sure
           the check box under the column heading "Journal" is unmarked for
           the ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM globals and then click "OK."
  
  
  
   5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
   6)  Distribution Load:
  
       Load the Distribution from the Packman Message using the Packman
       function "Install/Check Message."
  
         Environment Check:
  
           Only package components and system variables will be checked
           during the loading of the transport global.
  
   7)  KIDS Installation:
  
  
  
       Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action "Install
       Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*14.  The KIDS installation
       should take less than a minute (with journaling off) depending
       on the number of users/jobs on the system.
  
         Environment Check:
  
           LEX*2*14 data exists (by global translation):
  
             If the data for LEX*2*14 has been installed and is translated
             into the current account, then only package components and
             system variables will be checked.
  
           LEX*2*14 data does not exist:
  
  
  
             If the data for LEX*2*14 can not be found (either in the
             current account or by translation) then the environment check
             routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build namespace
             and global checksum.  This is to insure that the correct
             import global is loaded and that all of the data contained in
             the import global arrived at your site during the FTP
             transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the wrong import
             global or the global fails the checksum, the install will
             stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP another copy of
             the import global (see the section on FTP Software Retrieval
             and step 3 of the Installation Instructions).
  
       Disable Options:
  
  
         When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and 
         Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
       
 
   8)  Cleanup
  
       a)  Kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
  
           After the installation of this patch you will need to kill
           the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent import global
           checksum errors on future installations.  (see step 2 for
           "unsubscripted" kills)
  
       b)  If journaling was turned off in step 4 for the ^LEX and ^LEXT
           globals, turn journaling back on.
  
           DSM
  
             Same instructions as in step 4 except select "E" for "Enabled"
  
           Open M
  
             Same instructions as in step 4 except make sure the check
             box under the column heading "Journal" is marked for the
             ^LEX and ^LEXT globals.
  
       c)  Delete routines LEX2014 and LEX2014P if they exist.  These
           are environment check and post-install routines.
