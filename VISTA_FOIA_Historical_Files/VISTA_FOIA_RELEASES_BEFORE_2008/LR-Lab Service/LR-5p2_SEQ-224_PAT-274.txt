Description: 
============

 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*274 contains no changes to software 
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.  
   
 ==================== 
 Patch Description:
  
 (1) WKLD CODE (#64) file is updated with the latest released National 
 Laboratory Test (NLT) codes.
  
  
 (2) This patch allows the user to manually encode CPT codes for a given 
 accession. This method of CPT coding does not use the CPT codes 
 associated by the mapping of LABORATORY TEST file (#60) entries to WKLD 
 CODE file (#64).
     The user can select any appropriate CPT code(s) to identify the 
 professional service(s) rendered during this particular tissue exam. The 
 user can select from a pre-defined pick list or enter CPT codes 
 individually separated by commas ",".
     The pick list can be defined by editing the ES DISPLAY ORDER field 
 (#26) of the WKLD CODE file (#64). The number entered in the ES DISPLAY 
 ORDER field controls the order of CPT codes in the pick list. The 
 numerical order of the pick list uses the number entered in ES DISPLAY 
 ORDER field for each WKLD CODE defined.
  
 (3) The NLT Mapped Code Search [LRCAP64S] option has been changed to 
 correctly respond to the following prompt at the end of each page:
 "Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit:"
  
 ======================= 
 New/Enhanced Options:
  
 1. Edit or Print WKLD CODES [LR WKLD CODE EDIT PRINT] option has been 
 enhanced to include the new field ES DISPLAY ORDER (#26) of WKLD CODE 
 (#64) file. This option is used to print or edit fields in the WKLD CODE 
 (#64) file. 
 2. The new option LAB CPT BILLING [LRCAPES] has been created to provide 
 manual CPT billing and laboratory workload capture. The LAB CPT BILLING 
 option has no security key restriction. The option has been added to the 
 Verify/release menu, anat path [LRAPVR] option.
     The LAB CPT BILLING option can be used anytime after the accession 
 has been created. If the accession has been purged, the option cannot be 
 used. The LAB CPT BILLING option has two functions:
  
    A.  If the procedure was ordered on a patient from PATIENT (#2) file, 
 from a location that has TYPE (#2) of CLINIC, MODULE or OTHER as defined 
 in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file, the user identified CPT codes will 
 be passed to the Laboratory PCE API. If the PCE API accepts the passed 
 data, the PCE ENC # (30) field of the ACCESSION NUMBER SUB-FIELD (#68.02 
 of the DATE SUB-FIELD (68.01) of the ACCESSION (#68) file will be 
 populated with the PCE visit number. CPT billing can be done multiple 
 times for the same accession. 
  
    B. The software will also capture the WKLD CODE(s) associated with the 
 ES DISPLAY ORDER number. This data will be captured as laboratory 
 workload. It will be reported based on the current LMIP workload 
 reporting protocol.
  
 3. Electronic Catalog Print [LA7S PRINT CATALOG] option [LA7S PRINT] 
 template has been modified to display the LEDI HL7 (#.09) field of the 
 TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file instead of the SNOMED CODE (#2) field. This 
 is to assist LEDI collection sites with defining the LAB SHIPPING 
 CONFIGURATION (#62.9) file.
  
 4. Print log book [LRAPBK] option has been enhanced to display a list of 
 CPT codes passed to PCE for outpatients. This option can also be used to 
 provide a partial audit of CPT coding practices.

 Files:
 There are no new files contained in this patch. However the following 
 files will be updated with additional data.
 (1) WKLD CODE (#64) file will be updated with any missing National 
 Laboratory Test (NLT) codes during the post installation phase. LAB 
 NLT/CPT CODES (#64.81) contains a complete listing of NLT codes. WKLD 
 CODE (#64) file is checked to determine if an NLT code should be added. 
 If the new NLT code is successfully added to WKLD CODE (#64) file or the 
 NLT code already exists, the entry in LAB NLT/CPT CODES (#64.81) file is 
 deleted.
  
  
 (2) The TEST/PROCEDURE (#.01) field of the SPECIMEN # (#1) subfile of LAB 
 ORDER ENTRY (#69) file, input screen has been changed to allow the entry 
 of LABORATORY TEST (#60) that have the TYPE (#3) field set to OUPUT. This 
 screen was changed in the software of an earlier released patch. The user 
 should see no difference in software behavior.
  
  
 (3) The DSS TEST NUMBER (#.01) field of the RESULT (#8) subfile of LAR 
 DSS LAR EXTRACT (#64.036) file has been increased from 50 to 300 to 
 accommodate patch ECX*3*47 number of tests to be extract.
  
 Below is a listing of files exported by this patch, indicating if the 
 imported file will contain additional data.
                                            
 FILE #      NAME                       With Data    
 ----------------------------------------------
  
 64          WKLD CODE                    NO   
 64.036      LAB DSS LAR EXTRACT          NO
 64.2        WKLD SUFFIX CODES            YES
 64.21       WKLD CODE LAB SECT           YES
 64.22       WKLD ITEM FOR COUNT          YES
 64.3        WKLD INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURER YES
 64.81       LAB NLT/CPT CODES            YES
 68          ACCESSION                    NO    
  
  
 Note:
 The LAB NLT/CPT CODES (#64.81) file is purged during the pre-installation 
 phase. This file is only used to update THE WKLD CODE (#64) file and has 
 no other purpose or function. This file will have no data after the post 
 installation routine has successfully run to completion.
  
 ====================== 
 New Fields:
  
 ES DISPLAY ORDER(#26) field has been added to the WKLD CODE (#64) file. 
 This field is used by the LAB CPT BILLING option to display a pick list 
 of those CPT codes defined by the NLT code. CPT codes can be selected by 
 using this number.
  
 PCE ENC # (#30) of ACCESSION NUMBER SUB-FIELD (#1) of ACCESSION (#68) 
 file has been added. This free text field contains a list of PCE Visit 
 numbers generated for this accession. If there are multiple visit numbers 
 for this accession they are separated by ';'. This field is only 
 populated if professional service PCE workload is generated. This is 
 usually the type of PCE workload generated by the Pathologist reporting 
 anatomic pathology services. PCE workload is only generated for those 
 hospital locations with the type of clinic, module or other. 
  
 Note:
 No PCE workload is generated for inpatient locations.
  
 ========================= 
 Modified Print Template:
  
 Electronic Catalog Print [LA7S PRINT CATALOG] option LA7S PRINT template 
 has been changed to display the LEDI HL7 (#.09) field instead of SNOMED 
 CODE (#2) in TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) field. The LEDI HL7 field is required 
 by LEDI collecting sites when defining tests to be sent to the Host 
 laboratory and shipping manifest. The LEDI HL7 specimen must match the 
 specimen the HOST laboratory requires.
  
 ==========================
 Input Template:
   Input Template [LR WKLD EDIT ALL] has been modified to allow editing of 
 all user definable fields in the WKLD CODE (#64) file. Most notable is 
 that the LOINC CODE (#4) field of the TIME ASPECT (#30) sub-file of the 
 WKLD CODE (#64) file. This template is very useful to delete or correct 
 LOINC CODE entry in the WKLD CODE (#64) file.
   Input Template [LR WKLD ES CPT] is designed to allow quick editing of 
 the ES DISPLAY ORDER (#26) field and to edit all CODE (#18) sub-file 
 entries. The CODE sub-file is where CPT CODE assignments are entered.

  ===============================================
  
  
 Post Install instruction:
  
 The Laboratory Information Manager (LIM) should obtain from the Anatomic 
 Pathology department, a list containing CPT codes for the procedures most 
 frequently performed.  The entries on this list need to be ranked by 
 frequency (i.e. most frequently used procedure is #1, next frequently 
 used procedure is #2, etc.) This list will provide a template for the 
 display listing. Next, the LIM need to select a NLT code from the WKLD 
 CODE (#64) file with the corresponding CPT code. Next, using the option 
 Edit or Print WKLD CODES[LR WKLD CODE EDIT PRINT] option, edit the ES 
 DISPLAY ORDER (#26) field by entering the sequence number from the 
 frequency list and edit the CODE (#18) field multiple with the 
 appropriate CPT Code(s). 
 Editing of the WKLD CODE file can be done with the Edit or Print WKLD 
 CODES [LR WKLD CODE EDIT PRINT] option.
  
 ================================================
 User Information: 
 The user performing the CPT coding for tissue exam using the LAB CPT 
 BILLING [LRCAPES] option can enter the ES DISPLAY ORDER number (the 
 sequence number from the frequency list) to select CPT codes. The user 
 can enter double question marks '??' to see a list of CPT codes 
 selectable by entering the ES DISPLAY ORDER numbers. If the appropriate 
 code does not appear on the list, the user can enter the individual CPT 
 code number(s) separated by commas.
  
 The coding software ensures that all CPT codes selected are active. If 
 the user does not have the PROVIDER security key, a valid active provider 
 must be entered. The user reviews the accessioned test(s) and the CPT 
 codes selected. The user is prompted to accept or reject the information.
  
 After accepting the previous information the software will determine, 
 using the TYPE (#2) field of the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file, if the 
 location entered is an outpatient location. Those locations with the type 
 of clinic, module or other are considered to be out patient location. CPT 
 coding is ONLY PASSED FOR OUT PATIENT LOCATION TYPES. If the specimen is 
 assigned to a Patient as defined by an entry in the PATIENT (#2) file, 
 the specified CPT codes are passed immediately to the Laboratory/PCE API. 
 The date/time of the visit is set to specimen collection date/time. If 
 the time is not specified, a default of 12:01 is used. The PCE API 
 returns the visit number which is stored in the PCE ENC (#30) field of 
 the ACCESSION NUMBER (#1) sub-file of the DATE (#.01) sub-file of the 
 ACCESSION (#68) file.
  
 The software will also store the WKLD CODES associated with the CPT codes 
 selected. These WKLD CODE are added to the Laboratory LMIP workload for 
 that accession. This is done regardless of the location type.
