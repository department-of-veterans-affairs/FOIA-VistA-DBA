1. Under certain circumstances the APD cross-reference in the DRUG
"BLD",823,1,3,0)
INGREDIENT file (#50.416) was not being properly set.  This patch remedies
"BLD",823,1,4,0)
that defect and creates those entries which were not properly set in the
"BLD",823,1,5,0)
past.
"BLD",823,1,6,0)
 
"BLD",823,1,7,0)
2. It has been noted that some sites have made local entries to the DRUG
"BLD",823,1,8,0)
INGREDIENT file.  This should not have been done.  While this was not the
"BLD",823,1,9,0)
proximal cause of the problem noted in item 1, it may have exacerbated the
"BLD",823,1,10,0)
problem.  Some of these locally added ingredients may have been
"BLD",823,1,11,0)
overwritten by nationally entered ingredients.
"BLD",823,1,12,0)
This patch modifies the data dictionary of this file so that local
"BLD",823,1,13,0)
entries can no longer be made.
"BLD",823,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",823,1,15,0)
3. It has also been noted that over 1250 entries in the DRUG INTERACTION
"BLD",823,1,16,0)
file (#56) involving these locally added ingredients have been added.
"BLD",823,1,17,0)
If the locally added ingredients have been overwritten, these interactions
"BLD",823,1,18,0)
will be interactions involving the national ingredients.
"BLD",823,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",823,1,20,0)
Sites are strongly urged to review locally added interactions to verify
"BLD",823,1,21,0)
that they have not been changed.  Sites are also strongly urged to
"BLD",823,1,22,0)
inactivate any interactions involving local ingredients.  Finally, sites
"BLD",823,1,23,0)
are urged to review any allergies entered for drug ingredients to verify
"BLD",823,1,24,0)
that they have not been changed.
