Subject: INVOICE UPLOAD CHECKER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  When an invoice is being uploaded into VISTA, an error check is performed
  to ensure all the vital data elements are in place. A change was made
  recently by the vendor which consisted of them no longer sending NDCs
  that contained non-numeric characters. This caused a flag by the error
  checker. The flag is set when the system cannot find either the NDC or
  the UPC for an item. The solution is to add a check for the VSN. If
  all three of these items cannot be located, then the invoice is missing
  the most important information.
  
  
  Also added more checks to the verification portion of the procedure 
  that also performs the same functions.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 5 minutes.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*19).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3.0*19.
  
  6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//' respond  NO.
   
  7. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
