 NOIS Overview
 -------------
 1. LOM-1201-61059     RT TASK CONSUMING 100% OF NODE's CPU
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It has been reported that the Generate Record Retirement Pull
    Lists [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option from the 'Inactivate Records
    Menu' is a heavy consumer of system resources, using up to 100%
    of the cpu.  
    
    It was noticed that some sites are answering "No" to the 'Use
    terminal digit scan prompt?', because the RECORD TRACKING SORT GLOBAL
    (#194.3) file has not been recompiled for several years.  This forces
    the Generate Record Retirement Pull Lists [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option
    to look at every record in the RECORDS (#190) file.
    
    The developer also discovered some glitches with the compile of the
    RECORD TRACKING SORT GLOBAL (#194.3) file launched from the prompt
    'Use terminal digit scan prompt?', if a user answers "YES" and the RECORD
    TRACKING SORT GLOBAL (#194.3) file had not been compiled yet in the
    current year.  These issues were 1) the background job would abort if
    broken pointers were encountered, and 2) the Generate Record Retirement
    Pull Lists [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option would not allow restarting the
    compile job if it failed to complete successfully.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The software was modified to speed up the processing by using the "AC"
    cross-reference instead of the "C" crossreference of the REQUESTED
    RECORDS (#190.1) file when using the Generate Record Retirement Pull
    Lists [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option.  In addition, when responding to
    the prompt for a terminal digit entry, we have added a statement
    recommending that the range of digits be limited to 10.
    
    The software was also modified to fix the two issues related to the
    compile of the RECORD TRACKING SORT GLOBAL (#194.3) file.  Broken
    pointers will no longer cause the background job to abort, and if
    the compile fails to complete, the user may restart it using the
    Generate Record Retirement Pull Lists [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option.
    
    It is recommended for sites to follow these steps in the future when
    attempting to use the Generate Record Retirement Pull Lists
    [RT INACT-PULL-CREATE] option after installation of this patch:
  
      1) Schedule any recompiling of file 194.3 during off hours--
         for some sites this process, which is normally done once a year,
         will be the first recompile in many years and may run a long time. 
      2) Always respond 'Yes' to the "Use terminal digit scan?" prompt.
      3) Use a terminal digit range of no more than 10 digits,
         for example, 0-9, 10-19, etc.
