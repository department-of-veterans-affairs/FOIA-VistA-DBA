Subject: PATIENT DEFAULT STOP DATE/TIME

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 A site reported a problem with the stop date/time on pending and 
 pending renewed orders.
  
 The Pharmacist's User Manual states: 
 "When the SAME STOP DATE ON ALL ORDERS parameter is set to 
 yes, the module will assign a default stop date for each patient. This 
 date is initially set when the first order is entered for the patient. A 
 new default stop date is assigned for the patient when an order is 
 renewed and the order's stop date plus three days is greater than the 
 current default stop date. This date is shown as the default value for 
 the stop date of each order entered for the patient. However, if a day or 
 dose limit exists for the selected Orderable Item, and the limit is less 
 than the default stop date, the earlier stop date and time will be 
 displayed."  
  
 The way the screen defaults in pharmacy for finishing would lead the 
 pharmacist to finish the new order prior to finishing the renewals. 
 This creates the potential for medication orders to default to an 
 "incorrect" stop date/time. This problem caused a patient to completely 
 miss receiving a newly ordered medication, as the new order expired prior 
 to the first scheduled dose time.
  
 The following example shows the way the screen displays the orders from 
 the PENDING/NON-VERIFIED option:
  
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - A C T I V E - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    1    MULTIVITAMINS TAB                   C  04/01  04/08  R
           Give: 1 TABLET PO QAM (07) 
  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  P E N D I N G  - - - - - - - - - - - - 
    2    CAPTOPRIL TAB                         ?  *****  *****            
         Give: 25MG PO QAM (07) 
  - - - - - - - - - - - - P E N D I N G   R E N E W A L S - - - - - - - - 
    3    MULTIVITAMINS TAB                   ?  *****  *****  P 04/06   
           Give: 1 TABLET PO QAM (07)
  
  
  
 This patch corrects the problem by reversing the order in which the 
 PENDING and PENDING RENEWALS are displayed.  With the entries reversed 
 the user will finish the PENDING RENEWAL order first, followed by the 
 PENDING order, and the correct stop date/time will be displayed.
