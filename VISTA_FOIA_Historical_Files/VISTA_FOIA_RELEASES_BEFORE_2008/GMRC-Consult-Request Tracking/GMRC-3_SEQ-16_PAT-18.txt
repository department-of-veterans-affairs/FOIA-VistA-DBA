Description: 
============

   This patch provides the following nine changes to the Consult/Request 
   Tracking System:
  
      1.  Change Notification Alerts.
      2.  Add date & time to Hierarchy report.
      3.  Allow Editing and Resubmitting of a Canceled Consult from the 
          Consults tab.
      4.  New parameter to vary the number of days to search backwards for   
          pending consults when linking a Progress Note to a consult from
          the Notes tab.  Data is being sent to update the PARAMETER 
          DEFINITION file (8989.51).
      5.  Corrects an "undefined variable" when listing the Hierarchy.
      6.  Adds an Identifier to the SERVICE/SPECIALTY field. A new "ID" node 
          is being added to the DD for the REQUEST SERVICES file (#123.5).
      7.  List Manager version will pull the same Eligibility field PRIMARY 
          ELIGIBILITY as the GUI instead of the TYPE OF PATIENT field. 
      8.  Added SCHEDULED consults in the GROUP UPDATE selection list of
          the CONSULT MANAGEMENT menu.
      9.  An array will be passed to CPRS GUI v15.  The array will
          consist of Consult synonyms.
  
  
   Changes to the CPRS GUI interace will appear when OR*3*85 (CPRS
   GUI version 15) is installed.
  
   Change 1.  NOTIFICATION ALERT CHANGE.
   ----------------------------------
  
   Patch OR*3*88 installed a new type notification, #63, CONSULT/REQUEST 
   UPDATED.  GMRC*3*18 includes the code to begin sending this alert instead 
   of #27, NEW SERVICE CONSULT/REQUEST, when the add comment or the
   schedule consult actions are performed.  Consults manipulates the text
   string to be appropriate to the action taken, then sends alert number
   #63 CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED, to CPRS along with appropriate alert text.
   The alert text then shows as follows:
  
   Adding a Comment : "Comment Added to Consult: . . ."
  
   Scheduling:  "Scheduled Consult:  . . ."
  
   The notification is exported as DISABLED and the deletion parameter set to 
   "Individual Recipient" .  These parameters will have to be changed by the 
   Clinical Coordinator or IRM as necessary to invoke the new notification
   using the "XPAR MENU" tools.
  
   Change 2.  LIST CONSULT SERVICE HIERARCHY Report (LH).
   ---------------------------------------------------
  
   NOIS PUG-0800-52632 requested the run date and time to be placed in the 
   report heading line.
  
   Change 3.  EDITING and RESUBMITTING OF A CANCELED CONSULT.
   ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   NOIS MAC-0600-61490, ANC-0800-50477 and E3R 13711 described problems of 
   not being able to edit and resubmit a canceled consult if not done through 
   the alert.  A new protocol [GMRCACT EDIT/RESUBMIT CONSULT] has been
   added to patch 18 that allows the provider or update user to edit and
   resubmit a canceled consult through the Consult Service Tracking [GMRC
   SERVICE TRACKING] option. This is a departure from previous practice
   which only allowed these actions when responding to a Canceled  Consult
   Alert.
  
   Currently this protocol only works in List Manager mode.  Version 15 of
   the CPRS GUI will allow the provider or update user to edit/resubmit a
   canceled consult.
  
   Change 4.  NEW PARAMETER.
   ----------------------
  
   NOIS BIR-1000-32052, LAS-1000-61120, DUB-0799-31375.  When completing 
   consults from the Notes tab, after selecting a title, you are given a list 
   of consults to which the note may be linked.  This list is currently limited
   to consults entered in the last 365 days.  The new parameter "GMRC CONSULT 
   LIST DAYS" will allow sites to vary this value at the System level or by  
   Divisions.  The default parameter, set at the package level, is set to 365 
   days.  Clinical coordinators or IRM will update this variable as needed.
  
   Change 5.  UNDEFINED VARIABLE.
   ---------------------------
  
   NOIS CPH-0900-40764.  The installation of patch GMRC*3*16 uncovered a 
   problem with errant cross references in the REQUEST SERVICES file (#123.5). 
   The error that appears at PROC+5^GMRCASV is corrected by this patch. 
  
   Change 6.  CONSULT SERVICE IDENTIFIER.
   -----------------------------------
  
   NOIS PUG-0600-50119.  To assist users when selecting a "SERVICE/SPECIALTY" 
   an IDENTIFIER field has been added".  The SERVICE USAGE field (Grouper, 
   Tracker Only) will appear next to the "SERVICE/SPECIALTY" name.  A post 
   install routine (GMRCYP18) will update the data dictionary.  The post
   install routine will be deleted at the end of the KIDs installation.
  
   Change 7.  CONSULT ELIGIBILITY FIELD.
   ----------------------------------
  
   NOIS DUR-0700-31266.  In the List Manager (LM) version of Consults it was 
   noticed that the patient eligibility was being filled in at the time the 
   consult was placed.  The problem is that patient eligibility could
   change by the time the consult was being acted upon.  The eligibility
   being used by the CPRS GUI cover sheet is the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY field
   [DPT(2) field .361].  LM has been using the TYPE OF PATIENT field
   [DIC(8) field 5].
  
   LM has been changed to use the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY field.
  
   Change 8.  GROUP UPDATE "SCHEDULED" CONSULTS.
   ---------------------------------
  
   NOIS PUG-0800-52633 and E3R 14985.  The List Manager option Consult
   Management [GMRC MGR] and the option Group update of consult/procedure
   requests [GMRCSTSU] have had three enhancements added: 1) the selection
   of "PENDING or ACTIVE" consults has been changed to include "SCHEDULED";
   2) when adding a comment from the group update option it will now use
   the Word Processing edit function instead of a line editor; and 3) when
   using the "Print report & update records" option a response (Y/N) to
   stop or continue with updating the selected consults has been added
   between printing the report and updating the records.
  
   Change 9.  Consult Synonyms.
   -------------------------
  
   NOIS-BIR-1299-30420.  A routine has been developed (GMRCASV1) that will 
   provide a list of Consult synonyms for selection from the CPRS GUI
   interface. This functionality will be provided by patch OR*3*85 (CPRS
   GUI version 15).
