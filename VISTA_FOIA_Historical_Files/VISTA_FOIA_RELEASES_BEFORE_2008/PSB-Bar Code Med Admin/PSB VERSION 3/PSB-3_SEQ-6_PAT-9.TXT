Description:
============

  
  
  1.  Problem: NOIS CTX-0804-70321
      Large volume IV orders do not show on the Due List Report.  The
      Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Due List Report does
      not display information for large volume IV orders that have
      been created on the date selected for reporting.  
  
      Corrective Action:
      The BCMA Due List Report will display large volume IV data when
      appropriate.
  
  
  2.  Problem: NOIS MIW-0504-40557
      Scheduled administration times are reported and totaled on the
      Ward Administration Times Report per each clock hour.  If an
      order's stop time is between clock hours, that order's final
      scheduled administration is neither reported nor added to the
      report totals.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The BCMA Ward Administration Times Report will report and
      total all appropriate scheduled administration times.    
  
  
  3.  Problem: NOIS LIT-0704-71393
      The initial administration of an order which displays on the BCMA
      Graphical User Interface (GUI) Intravenous/Piggyback (IVPB) Tab 
      may result with an administration status of "GIVEN", "HELD", or
      "REFUSED".  When this same order is administered via the VISTA 
      Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, the 
      initial administration status can only be "GIVEN".
  
      Corrective Action:
      The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option will
      allow the initial administration of an IVPB order to result in
      an administration status of "GIVEN", "HELD", or "REFUSED".
  
  
  4.  Problem: NOIS UNY-0304-10606
      When the user prints a Medication Administration History (MAH)
      report with a date range exceeding seven (7) days, Pro Re Nata
      (PRN) order activity, which occurred that last day of the
      report's date range, does not display.
  
      Corrective Action:
      PRN activity occurring within the selected MAH report date range
      will display on that MAH report.
  
  
  5.  Problem:
      When creating a MAH report, the administration times of orders
      that have start time between the report's date range do not
      display properly.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The MAH report will display order administration times properly.
  
  
  6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0105-30190
      When using the GUI Edit Med Log to add a comment for an 
      administration having units given less than 1.0, the message - "When 
      changing the admin status to Given, at least one dispensed drug must 
      have a units given ..."  - is displayed and the comment is not filed.
      This error is due to the value in the Units Given field of the GUI
      Edit Med Log being presented without the "leading zero" when the 
      value is less than 1.0.
  
      Corrective Action:
      When the Units Given value of an administration is less than zero, 
      it will be presented via the GUI Edit Med Log with the leading zero.
  
  
  7.  Problem: NOIS ISB-1104-31950
      The Medication History Report does not display a leading zero in
      its "Units GIVEN" data field when displaying a numeric fraction.
  
      Corrective Action:
      A leading zero will display in the Medication History Report,
      "Units GIVEN" data field when appropriate.
  
  
  8.  Problem: NOIS BUT-1204-21117
      There are instances when the "Units Of Administration" data field
      of the Medication History Report does not "break" and remain legible.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The "Units Of Administration" data field of the Medication History
      Report will "break" and maintain whole words and legibility.
  
  
  9.  Problem: NOIS UNY-0105-11034
      The heading for the Due List Report, "Future Orders" section is 
      displayed and is not followed by "Future Order" data when at least
      one future active order exists, and no future order has a scheduled 
      administration within the range of the selected report time 
      parameters.
  
      Corrective Action:
      The heading for the Due List Report, "Future Orders" section will not
      display, unless "Future Order" data is to be displayed.
