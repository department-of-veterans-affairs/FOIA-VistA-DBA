Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*57   <<= must be installed BEFORE `MPIF*1*4'

Subject: MPI DIRECT CONNECT LINK TO SUPPORT DNS

Category: 
  - Other

Description: 
============

  Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - which is a controlled
  release.  If you do not have Master Patient Index Vista, contact your 
  CIRN Implementation Manager about getting on the installation schedule.
   
  This patch is exporting the HL7 Logical Link (file #870) entry
  MPIVA DIR with the Domain field (#.03) populated with 
  MPIDC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV to support DNS routing.  This new domain 
  was created by patch XM*DBA*135.  The pre-init routine MPIFPRE4
  checks for the existance of the domain in the domain file.
  
   **Note:  There are no routines associated with this patch other than 
   the pre-init routine, MPIFPRE4, which will be automatically deleted
   upon completion of the installation. 
  
  TEST SITE: Bay Pines VAMC

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  ***NOTE:  If this patch is installed in a non-production account
  (including developments accounts or support accounts at the CIOFOs)
  the HL7 Logical Link, MPIVA DIR will need to have it's TCP/IP Address
  field changed to the IP Address of the Test MPI - 152.127.1.7.  This is
  to stop any test account data from impacting the LIVE MPI at the AAC.***
