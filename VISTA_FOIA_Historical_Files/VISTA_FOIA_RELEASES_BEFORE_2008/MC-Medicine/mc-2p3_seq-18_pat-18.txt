Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the following:
  
 1. Modification of routine MCOR1.
      If the user selects a medicine report that is not in
      Consult/Request Tracking, the message `Full Procedure
      report not available through Consults' will be displayed
      instead of `Report not implemented for the criteria chosen'.
  
 2. NOIS HUN-1095-21635 PTF Report Status.
      Options: Enter/Edit PFT [MCFLPFT]
               Enter/Edit PFT (Screen) [MCFSPFT]
      Modification of routine MCESEDT.
        If a verified Pulmonary Fuction Test record was in the
        process of being superseded by the user and the user 
        up arrow ("^") out at the Electronic Signature prompt,
        the record was returned to a Draft status. This routine
        modification will correct this and the record will return
        to the original status, Verified.
  
 3. NOIS HUN-0196-20196 Computer Generated Interpret, showing up
      Option: Interpretation Enter/Edit [MCFLPFTI]
              Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT]
      Modification of template MCPFTBRPR1.
        If a user selects the option, Interpretation Enter/Edit
        [MCFLPFTI], and enters "NO" for COMPUTER GENERATED
        INTERPRETATION prompt, the COMPUTER GENERATED
        INTERPRETATION stills prints on the Brief PFT Report.
  
 4. NOIS PHI-0497-22749 `Reviewed by' not on Full Holter Report.
      Option: Holter Test Results [MCFPHOLTER]
      Modification of template MCARHOLT1.
        Added field "14", "Reviewed By" in the Holter File 691.6
        to the print template.
  
 5. NOIS LAK-0596-31744 Hospital name not on Echo Report.
                        Request name on all Medicine Reports.
      The Division Field Must Be Filled-in In The Hospital Location File #44
                                                                   
      Modifification of routines MCARP and MCPFTP to print the
      hospital name on the Medicine Reports.
  
  
 6. NOIS HUN-0598-20455 HEAD+1^MCARP:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF.
                        The user printed a PFT report through
                        the REPORTS tab in CPRS and closed out,
                        he then "^" to the next option causing an
                        undefined error with the variable "PG".
      Initializing the variable "PG" in routine MCPFTP and killing 
      ^UTILITY($J,1) after use in routine MCPFTP5.
