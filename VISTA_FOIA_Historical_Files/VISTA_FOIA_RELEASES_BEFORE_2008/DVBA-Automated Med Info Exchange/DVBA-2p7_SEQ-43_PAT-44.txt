Subject: AMIE PARAMETER REMOVAL

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch address the following NOIS's:
 PUG-0302-50237     ENTRY ACTION STATEMENT IN VISTA OPTION
 ISP-0502-N0663      CAPRI   Site has disabled CAPRI
  
 An entry action of "D ^ANUCL" was erroneously placed as an entry action for
 option DVBA CAPRI GUI.  This patch will install a new DVBA CAPRI GUI option
 that does not contain this entry.
  
 In addition, it has been recommended by the Office of Information Assurance
 that the AMIE-II purge for 7131 (Request for medical information) requests
 and 2507 (C&P Exam) requests be disabled so that requests and results of
 requests will be maintained in VistA indefinately.  This is accomplished
 by removing values from field 9 (NUMBER OF DAYS TO KEEP HISTORY) and field
 .11 (DAYS TO KEEP 2507 HISTORY) in the AMIE SITE PARAMETER FILE (#396.1).
 
 When installing this patch, it will automatically delete the settings from 
 the AMIE-SITE PARAMETER FILE. Fields 9 (NUMBER OF DAYS TO KEEP HISTORY) and 
 .11 (DAYS TO KEEP 2507 HISTORY) will be marked as starred for deletion with 
 DVBA*2.7*44.
