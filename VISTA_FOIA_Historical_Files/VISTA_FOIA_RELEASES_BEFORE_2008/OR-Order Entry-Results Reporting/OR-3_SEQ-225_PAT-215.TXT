 KNOWN ISSUES:
 =============
  
 Listed below are six Known Issues identified with the release of OR*3*215.
 Per Executive Directive Memorandum "Software Release with Known Defect
 Reporting" the following information regarding each Known Issue is 
 provided below: the issue, impacts, workarounds (alternative methods to do
 the job), and resolution. 
  
 The justification for release with these six issues is as follows: 
 The release of CPRS will support many interdependent projects, these 
 include but are not limited to:  Program Enhancements for Outpatient 
 Meals, Inpatient Meds for Outpatients, Patient Record Flags II, CCOW User 
 Context, Remote Data Views Enhancements to Display HDR Data, as well as 
 resolving thirty-eight patient safety issues some of which are over a 
 year old and are related to the medication ordering functionality that is 
 particularly vulnerable to sentinel events.  There are also over 100 
 unique Remedy and approximately 1000 ClearQuest tickets resolved by this 
 release.  Additional delays in releasing CPRS v26 will jeopardize the 
 development/testing/release schedule of OR*3*243 (CPRS v27).  
  
 - Known Issue # 1: PSI-06-007: IMO Text Orders Are Not Accessible on 
 Nurse Dashboard   
  
 Description: IMO Nursing Text Orders are displayed under the new IMO
 display group, Clinic Orders, because these text orders are frequently
 protocol orders and should be associated with the other IMO orders.
 However, because these text orders display under Clinic Orders, they are
 not accessible from the Nurse Dashboard.
  
 Impact: The impact of this problem is minimal due to the low number of
 sites using Care Management. Nurses will need to use CPRS along with Care
 Management to get all of the information. Additionally, many sites have
 defined local display groups for text orders.  Any text order that is not
 a member of the Nursing display group will experience the same problem.
  
 Workaround: To make these appear in the Care Management Nurse Dashboard, 
 the Clinic Orders display group must be a member of the Nursing display 
 group.
  
 Resolution: This issue will be resolved with ORRC*1*3.
  
 - Known Issue # 2: PSI-06-021: IMO & Care Management: Verify column 
 headlights in Care Management   
  
 Description: If a user orders inpatient medications from an IMO location,
 they will display under the Verify column in Care Management. Other types
 of orders such as for Radiology, Lab, etc. will not display under the
 Verify column in Care Management.
  
 Impact: The impact of this problem is minimal due to the low number of
 sites using Care Management. Nurses will need to use CPRS along with Care 
 Management to get all of the information. 
  
 Workaround: There is no known workaround for this issue.
  
 Resolution: To be determined.
  
 - Known Issue # 3: Rational Clearquest ticket 11166: Problem OR ALLERGY 
 ENTERED IN ERROR Parameter Inheritance
  
 Description: If the sites set the OR ALLERGY ENTERED IN ERROR to YES at 
 the highest class level, all of the lower or subclasses could also mark
 allergies as entered in error. This is functioning correctly. However, if
 a site set the highest level to YES and then set one of the lower classes
 to NO, the lower class setting was ignored and users in the lower class
 who should not have been able to mark allergies as entered in error could
 do so. Or, if the settings were reversed with the highest class set to NO
 and the lower class set to YES, the user would not be able to mark them.
  
 Impact: The impact of this issue is minimal. In CPRS GUI v25 anyone can 
 mark an allergy as entered in error. Because the inheritance is not 
 functioning correctly, sites may not be controlling the ability to mark 
 allergies as entered in error as they want: individuals that sites do not 
 want to mark allergies as entered in error may be able to or individuals 
 who should be able to mark an allergy as entered in error, may not be able
 to do so.
  
 Workaround: If sites want to set only the highest level setting, no other 
 work is required. However, if sites want to set lower-level subclasses 
 differently, they should not set the highest level class, but must then 
 set each individual subclass. 
  
 Resolution: This issue will be resolved with OR*3.0*243.
  
 - Known Issue # 4: Rational Clearquest ticket 11208: CPRSUpdate causing 
 Range Check errors   
  
 Description: There is a defect in CPRSUpdate (released with OR*3.0*10)
 which results in range check errors on workstations that have
 not been rebooted in 24.85 days or more. To prevent the errors from
 occurring, perform a PC reboot of all PCs prior to the GOLD server copy of
 the CPRS executable being put in place.
  
 Impact: The impact of this issue is minimal. The impact is that CPRSUpdate
 will not run unless the workstations are rebooted.
  
 Workaround: Perform a PC reboot of all PCs prior to the GOLD server copy 
 of the CPRS executable being put in place.
  
 Resolution: This will be fixed by patch OR*3.0*252.
  
 - Known Issue # 5: Rational Clearquest ticket 11409: Expiring Meds Alert
 NOT Firing for IMO Orders 
  
 Description: Expiring meds notifications are sent based on the display
 group in CPRS. Because IMO orders are displayed under the CLINIC ORDERS
 display group and this group is not checked for expiring medications, no
 expiring meds notification is performed.
  
 Impact: The impact of this issue is moderate.  Expiring med alerts will 
 not be triggered and clinicians will need to be more vigilant in watching 
 these medications, but the impact should be small because  IMO medications
 will normally be given in clinic.
  
 Workaround: None
  
 Resolution: This will be resolved with patch OR*3.0*251 which is targeting
 an installation compliance date that is complimentary to OR*3*215.
  
 - Known Issue #6: Rational Clearquest ticket 11408: When Trying to Use
 Drug Class, the Graph Is Blank 
  
 Description: When using Drug Class to set up public views for graphs, the
 graph is blank.  If you select a drug class, it does not display.
  
 Impact: The impact of this issue is moderate. Users will not be able to 
 graph drug classes but may use other methods, such as the drug name.
  
 Workaround: None
  
 Resolution: This will be resolved with patch OR*3.0*251 which is targeting
 an installation compliance date that is complimentary to OR*3*215.
  
 - CCOW/VPN Known Issue: CCOW May Not Work Properly If You Use VPN to 
 Access the VA Network Remotely. 
  
 Description: If you receive an error message when you use CCOW-compliant
 applications via VPN, the current workaround is to disable the context. If
 you are using multiple VistA applications while CCOW is disabled, please
 be sure to verify the active patient when switching applications.
  
 Resolution: The Sentillion v3.9.1 upgrade will resolve this issue, as will
 (independently) the VPN upgrade, however the availability for these
 upgrades is not known at this time.
  
 - ADDITIONAL ISSUES: During the testing of CPRS GUI v.26 (OR*3.0*215), 
 internal Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and the test sites discovered
 additional issues that were not resolved in OR*3.0*215. A document listing
 these issues is available upon patch release on the CPRS page:
 http://vista.med.va.gov/cprs/
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES:
 ======================
  
 - PSI-03-033: Use of "Suspended" Causing Problems (Remedy 67681)   
  
 A status of suspended was confusing to some clinicians. As a result, some 
 medications were thought to be discontinued or expired when they were not.
 After discussion with the CPRS Clinical Workgroup, the status was changed
 to "Active/Susp" to make the meaning of the status clearer. A description
 of the status was also added to medication order detailed displays on the
 Meds and orders tab.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-03-033: OR*3.0*215, GMTS*2.7*78, 
 and TIU*1*202.
  
 - PSI-03-035: Modifiers for Vitals Should Appear on Cover Sheet (Remedy 
 HD70215)   
  
 Previously, vitals modifiers measurements did not appear on the CPRS Cover
 Sheet. With this patch and the new vitals features, users can enter and
 view vitals with modifiers.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-03-035: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - Follow-up to PSI-03-060: IV Fluid Order Dialog Duration Limits Created 
 (NOIS HIN-1203-42283 closed with OR*3.0*195 release, OR*3.0*195 Known
 Issue # 2)
  
 Developers changed the IV Fluid Dialog IV duration limit field to restrict
 the number of digits that can be entered based on the duration type: 2
 digits for days, hours, and liters or 4 digits for milliliters. 
 PSI-03-060 was closed with the release of OR*3.0*195. 
  
 Related Issue: PSJ*5*120 implemented changes to do a compare of the value
 entered by the user and parameter settings. It acts on the lowest value.
 So, in some cases the value entered by CPRS will be ignored if one of the
 other comparison values is less. 
 For example, 
 - If a drug has a day limit of 5 days 
 - The pharmacist finishes the order as an Admixture that is set up for 1
   day 
 - The provider entered a duration of 10 days 
 The system would use 1 day.
  
 - PSI-04-011: Medical Clerk Placing Medication Orders (Remedy 88582)   
  
 In the reported incident, a medical clerk who only held SDMOB and SDOB 
 security keys and was not "authorized to write med orders" in the NEW 
 PERSON file (# 200) was able to electronically enter medication orders for
 a provider. The responsibility for the medication order lies with the
 physician who signed the order. 
  
 Keys and parameters control who is prohibited from either signing or
 entering orders in CPRS. A user who holds NO keys can enter medication
 orders in CPRS. In CPRS, only the following users MAY NOT place orders: 
  
 - Users whose ordering capability was disabled by parameter "ORWOR DISABLE
   ORDERING 
 - Users who hold more than one ordering signature key: OREMAS, ORELSE,
   ORES (multiple key conflict) 
  
 Other than the above users, regardless of what key users hold (no key,
 "PROVIDER", or OR* key), they are all allowed to place orders. But users
 without ORE* keys cannot sign and release orders; the medication orders
 would remain unreleased until signed by a valid provider. 
 For a no-key user, CPRS cannot tell whether the user is a medical clerk, a
 medical student, or an outpatient clerk. The last two types of users may
 need to enter medication orders that would be signed later by a provider.
 Sites can control entry of orders by administrative staff and clerks in 
 the following ways:
  
 - To disable an individual user's capability to enter any clinical order,
   sites can use the parameter "ORWOR DISABLE ORDERING". 
 - To prevent a clerk from entering medication orders, sites can set the
   parameter OR OREMAS MED ORDERS. 
 - To prevent a clerk from entering Non-VA medication information, the site
   can use the parameter OR OREMAS NON-VA MED ORDERS 
  
 No changes to CPRS were made. Documentation changes in OR*3.0*215 will
 address this patient safety issue.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-011: OR*3.0*215 and CPRS
 ReEngineering. CPRS ReEngineering will implement a new system for 
 restricting medication ordering, and evaluating role-based privileges 
 for medication order management.  This system will include tools 
 identifying the roles/users and their ordering privileges.
  
 - PSI-04-012: Show Consult Details (Remedy 67913)   
  
 From the Notes tab, it was too easy for a user to miss the Reason for 
 Consult. To address this problem, developers added a "Show Details" button
 to the title/consult selection (Progress Note Properties) screen. If a
 consult is selected, the button is enabled. If clicked, the identical
 detailed display shown on the Consults tab appears in a separate window,
 including a Print button.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-012: OR*3.0*215 and CPRS 
 ReEngineering. CPRS ReEngineering will utilize an indicator to 
 differentiate a consult result from a progress note (e.g., different 
 icon) when browsing notes on the notes tab if a note is a consult result.
  
 - PSI-04-040: Order Checks Now Appear to Signing Provider (E3R 16750)   
  
 CPRS will now display order checks when a provider signs orders, even if 
 the nurse entering the order has taken the "Release w/out MD signature"  
 action. Previously, this was not the case.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-040: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-047: Changing "IV Fluids" to "Infusions" (Remedy 70980)   
  
 Pharmacy finishes some "injectables" as Unit Dose and some as IV fluids 
 for workflow and accounting purposes. Because there was a concern that
 some medications that CPRS displayed under the "IV Fluids  display group
 are not administered intravenously, developers made the following changes:
  
   - "IV Fluid" display group was changed to "Infusion" for IV orders.
   - "IV Fluid" order menu was changed to "IV Fluid and Infusion".
   - "IV Fluid" order dialog's title was changed to "Infusion".
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-047: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-053: Deletion of Entered in Error Medication Orders (Remedy 
 68321)   
  
 A site entered an order that had a dangerously incorrect dosage, but the 
 order was discontinued immediately when the error was discovered. The
 order remained visible on the patient's long profile. Because the site
 sometimes reprints a label off of an inactive order, the site reprinted it
 once by mistake.  With OR*3*215, these changes to restrict actions on 
 erroneous DC'd orders will be required in both CPRS and Inpatient
 Medications:
  
   - Site will no longer be able to take an action on orders that were 
     entered in error.
   - A new DC/Entered in Error view was created that can be accessed from
     the custom view.
   - The default selection for the DC reasons was removed from CPRS.
   - A signature is now required for any orders that was DC'd with a 
     DC reason.
   - A bulletin will be sent to Pharmacy when an order is DC'd with a 
     reason of Entered in Error.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-053: OR*3.0*215 and CPRS 
 ReEngineering. CPRS ReEngineering will provide functionality that will 
 allow for changing the DC reason.
  
 - PSI-04-056: Renewed One-Time Complex Inpatient Medication Orders Do Not 
 Display in BCMA (NOIS MIN-1104-40006 closed with the release of
 PSJ*5.0*127)   
  
 Following a decision by the Inpatient Medications workgroup, developers 
 changed CPRS to prevent users from selecting one-time schedules for
 complex inpatient medications. Users can still select the Give Additional
 Dose Now check box for one-time orders.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-056: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-063: Users Can No Longer Take Actions on Orders Discontinued with
 Entered in Error (Remedy 71078)
  
 Per a decision by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup, developers made a change to
 CPRS so that users can no longer take actions on orders that are
 discontinued with a reason of "entered in error".
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-063: OR*3.0*215 and CPRS 
 ReEngineering. CPRS ReEngineering will provide functionality that will 
 allow for changing the DC reason.
  
 - PSI-04-065: Remote Data in CPRS GUI Safety and Usability Issues (Remedy 
 71084)   
  
 Previously, if users selected a report prior to selecting from which sites
 they wanted data, there was no indication that they were not receiving
 data. The tab would appear, but there would be no remote data because CPRS
 was written so that the user should select the desired sites and then the
 desired reports or lab information. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-065: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-066: Expiring Medication Alert Not Generated When Patients on 
 Pass (Remedy 70916)   
  
 When patients went on a pass, their medications were placed on hold and 
 because the alert checked against active medications only, the Expiring
 Medications alert was not triggered. To correct this problem, developers 
 changed the alert to check against active and on hold medications, and 
 the CPRS Technical Manual was updated to state that medications with a 
 status of HOLD also trigger this alert.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-066: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-067, PSI-04-069: Duration Required for Complex Inpatient 
 Medication Orders Using Then Conjunction and User Must Explicitly Enter
 Conjunction (Remedy 71096 & 71072)
  
 To address these patient safety issues, CPRS now requires the user to 
 enter a duration when selecting "Then" for part of an inpatient medication
 complex order. Hover text has been added to the drop-down box for
 Then/And. In addition, CPRS no longer auto-populates the "then/and" column
 on complex orders. The user must select the conjunction "then" or "and"
 for each row except the last row in a complex order. CPRS will not save
 the order if the user has not filled in the "then" or "and" in a valid
 row.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-067 and PSI-04-069: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-04-068: Uncosigned Progress Notes without Expected Cosigner (Remedy 
 69324)   
  
 Previously, a document with an the author and title that required 
 cosignature could be entered in TIU by means other than the CPRS GUI, but
 no expected cosigner was identified when the note was entered. Entry of
 the note could happen through upload or through the note being created
 automatically by another package. If the author who required cosignature 
 then edited the note in CPRS and signed it using the "Review/Sign
 Changes" menu item, the cosignature requirement was not enforced as it was
 if using the "Action/Sign" menu item. The result was a note that required
 cosignature, but did not have an expected cosigner identified. This note
 then essentially became invisible to most users of the electronic record.
 Developers added the same cosigner logic to the Review/Sign Changes item
 that is on the Action | Sign menu for consistency.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-04-068: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-002: If a Date/Time Prompt Is Defined in the ORDER DIALOG file 
 (# 101.41) to REQUIRE TIME (as well as the date), then CPRS GUI Will Honor
 that Setting (Remedy 71166)
  
 Certain generic orders, restraints, require that a time be entered for the
 nursing order. The workgroup agreed this is a defect and the software was 
 corrected.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-002: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-015: Complex Medication Orders Can Lose Part of The Order on 
 Transfer (Remedy 71262)   
  
 In this case, there was a complex outpatient order for a drug where the 
 order is for 3x500mg tablets in the morning and 4X500mg tablets at night.
 The site has 1500mg as a selectable dose but does not have 2000mg in their
 DRUG file (# 50). When the complex order is selected for transfer to
 inpatient, the inpatient complex order contains the first line of 1500mg
 in the morning, but not the second line of 2000mg in the evening. It is
 unknown how long this problem has existed. CPRS allowed the clinician to
 sign order without any warning that evening dose was not entered.
  
 Resolution:
  
   - Modify the software so that the free-text value populates the dosage 
     fields in the inpatient dialog. 
   - Remove the old order text from the information box. 
   - Resize the order dialog and the information box so it is easier to 
     see the active scroll bar. 
   - Remove boxes from the order caption.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-015: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-017: Error in Dose When Copying Order (Remedy 71250)   
  
 This PSI addresses the problem of copying an order that has been changed 
 to a new order. Previously in CPRS, the original order text and the new
 order text would appear in the order dialog's information box, on the
 Orders tab, and on the Meds tab. But it was hard to differentiate the most
 recent order text from the original order text without looking at the text
 in detail. Developers made some changes to address this problem:
  
   - The order text no longer displays the old order text on the Orders 
     tab or on the Meds tab.
   - When copying to a new order, CPRS no longer displays the old order 
     text in the order dialog's information box. The caption in the order
     text will now display the most recent order text.
   - To make it easier to see that the information window's scroll bar is 
     active (that there is additional text), developers slightly enlarged
     the order dialog form.
  
 CPRS still displays the word "Change" before the order text to let the 
 users know that the order was altered at some time. If the users want to
 see the original order's detail, they can still view the detail display of
 the order.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-017: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-018, PSI-06-042: Complex Order Units for Duration Field 
 Reverting to Days (Remedy HD71285, HD138222)
  
 For the first part of a complex order, if the user changed the units in 
 the duration field (the default is days), the units would changed back to
 days when the user moved off that field. Developers corrected this
 problem.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-018: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-026: Expected First Dose Display: CPRS Should Not Strip Out PRN 
 from Schedule (Remedy 87028 closed with the release of PSJ*5.0*133)
  
 Previously, CPRS displayed an Expected First Dose on Inpatient Medication 
 schedules with PRN in the base schedule name, but did not display an
 Expected First Dose on schedules that included a base schedule and a check
 in the PRN box. In addition, it was noted that BCMA treats any schedule
 with PRN in its name as a PRN schedule, so there should be no Expected
 First Dose displayed. 
  
 To correct problem for Simple Dose inpatient medication orders, CPRS will
 no longer look at the schedule text to determine if the schedule is a PRN
 schedule. CPRS will pass the base schedule and whether PRN has been
 checked to Inpatient Medications and Inpatient Medications will pass back
 an indicator telling CPRS if the schedule is considered a PRN schedule. If
 it is a PRN schedule, CPRS will not display an Expected First Dose. 
 For a complex inpatient medication order, CPRS will use only the schedule
 and the PRN checkbox in the first row to determine if the Expected First
 Dose should display in the order dialog. CPRS will not display the
 Expected First Dose if one the following is true; the schedule in the
 first row has a schedule type of PRN, the PRN checkbox in the first row is
 checked, or if pharmacy cannot determine the expected first dose based on
 the schedule information in the first row.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-026: OR*3.0*215 and OR*3.0*243. 
 OR*3.0*243 will address the problem in the complex tab of the medication 
 order dialog.  OR*3.0*243 will also not display the expected first dose 
 if it is an on-call schedule.
  
 - PSI-05-031: Terminated Users Not Displaying in Certain Selection Lists 
 or Views (Remedy 86736)   
  
 CPRS excluded terminated users from the selection list for "Notes by 
 author", as well as in the "Notes - custom view" and problem list
 "Filters" screen. This has been corrected.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-031: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-033: Drug Message Doesn't Always Display (Remedy 70869)   
  
 If the user changes medications in the order dialog box, the Message field
 from the DRUG file (# 50) did not always display for the new drug after
 selecting a dose. This has been corrected.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-033: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-040: Medication Order Comments Not Displaying Properly (Remedy 
 91982)   
  
 CPRS was incorrectly wrapping some of the medication comment text, which 
 might make it appear that text was missing. The text was present, but the
 display could lead the user to think that information was missing. This
 has been corrected.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-040: OR*3.0*215.
  
 - PSI-05-047: OERR/IV Meds, Problem with IV Order Not Being Visible When 
 Patient Was Admitted While Order Was Still Pending (Remedy 95680)
  
 When a patient was in an outpatient setting and the clinician wrote 
 orders, if the patient was admitted while the orders were pending, it was
 difficult to ensure that those orders were correctly carried out. The
 Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO) project addresses this issue.
 As part of that project, CPRS developers made a change so that if a 
 patient is admitted from an IMO clinic location before orders are signed, 
 CPRS prompts the users to select where the inpatient medication, infusion,
 or nursing text orders should be handled - in the IMO clinic location or
 whether they should be handled on the ward.  This should help resolve this
 type of problem.

 - PSI-05-077: CPRS Cover Sheet / Vitals Can Misalign Vitals Labels and 
 Values (Remedy 107085)   
  
 If a user selects vitals from the CPRS coversheet and utilizes the scroll 
 bar on the side, the values scroll up but the Y axis that contains the
 vitals name, such as Temperature, Pulse, etc., stays stationary,
 resulting, for example, in a value for a Pulse aligning on the grid with
 the Temperature label. The user could misinterpret the data thinking that
 the pulse was really the temperature.

 - PSI-05-081: Order Check Window Cutting Off Verbiage of Orders (Remedy 
 107292)   
  
 Developers added a fix as directed by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup. The 
 user can view all of the order check text by hovering the cursor over the
 window to display a hover hint with the complete text.

 not limited by the 256 height restriction for the display area.
  
 - PSI-05-083: Priority Field in the Order Dialog Accepts Free-Text (Remedy
 108406)   
  
 Developers changed the priority field so that users could not enter 
 free-text. Previously, if free-text was entered, the text was ignored and
 the priority was set to Routine. The Priority field will accept a null
 value (the user can select the priority and remove the text), which
 Pharmacy will treat as a priority of Routine.

 - PSI-05-091: Order Quantity Field Entry Problems on Change or Copy 
 Action (Remedy 112181)   
  
 Previously, if a user began to copy or change an order, the dialog that 
 came up had a 0 (zero) in the Quantity field, and if the user clicked in
 the field to change the quantity, the user could click to the left of the
 zero and enter a number while the zero remained making a quantity of 100
 rather than 10, for example. To address these issues, developers changed
 CPRS so that the quantity from the original order is displayed in the
 Quantity filed. Developers also changed CPRS so that if the user "clicks  
 into the Quantity, Days Supply, and/or Refill fields, the value in the
 field is highlighted so that typing will overwrite the value.

 - PSI-05-093: Personal Quick Orders with TIU Objects (Remedy 70924)   
  
 CPRS allows users to place TIU patient data objects, such as patient name,
 allergies, etc., in word processing fields. These objects can be saved in
 quick orders and they resolve appropriately. However, previously, if a
 user created a personal quick order, the objects did not resolve each
 time. So, if a user put a patient name object in the order, the name that
 appeared in the order would always be the name that was there when the
 personal quick order was saved. To correct this problem, CPRS now
 prohibits the saving of quick orders that contain patient data objects.

 OR*3.0*195 Known Issue # 8)  
  
 Previously, if a user typed the service name rather than selecting if from
 the list, the prerequisites or templates did not pop up or populate the
 Reason for Request. Developers corrected the problem. These items will
 appear whether the user types the service name or selects it from the
 list.

 - PSI-05-110: Changing a Diet Order in CPRS Does Not Warn User that Diet 
 Will Be Replaced (Remedy 120487 & 127367)
  
 Previously, if a user entered a diet order, the order automatically 
 replaced any existing diet order, and if no stop date was entered, any
 future diet order was also replaced. Diet orders have always worked this
 way in CPRS. To give the user a warning, if the patient has a current diet
 order or a future diet order where the date of the order they are entering
 overlaps the future order date, developers added a popup box to Inpatient
 Diet ordering that warns the user that the new order they are entering
 will replace the current diet, and if the user does not enter a stop date,
 that any future diets will also be replaced. The warning message contains
 the text of any applicable diets.
  
 HDS software involved in resolving PSI-05-110: OR*3.0*215 and CPRS

 functionality to determine if it would be better/more consistent to allow 
 users to change a current diet order rather than creating a new order.
  
 - PSI-05-112: Multiple Entries for Volume Do Not Display on Initial Entry 
 to the IV Ordering Screen (Remedy 119250)
  
 If a user entered the IV Ordering screen and selected the Solutions tab, 
 CPRS did not display the values for volume if there were multiple values.
 The drop-down box did appear after clicking in the Volume window. If the
 user selected the Additives tab first and then the Solutions tab, the
 drop-down box with the volume values appeared as it should. Developers
 changed CPRS so that when the user orders an IV fluid, CPRS will
 automatically display the Volume drop-down box the initial time a user
 entered either the Solutions or the Additives tab.

 - PSI-06-035: Patient Orders Appearing under the Wrong Category on the 
 Orders Tab (Remedy 134817)   
  
 This problem occurred when a patient is in the process of being admitted. 
 Usually within 15 to 20 minutes of the ADT movement, the provider placed
 one or more orders through an order set or quick orders that included
 medications. The medications on the Orders tab displayed under the
 Outpatient Meds service. However, on the Meds Tab, all the orders display
 under the Inpatient Meds section. The medications do appear in BCMA. With
 CPRS 26, an order may be entered for inpatient at an outpatient location.
 When the order is signed, the order location is changed back to the
 inpatient location. If the patient is admitted before the orders are
 signed, a warning is displayed alerting the user that all additional
 orders will use the ward as the location.

 NEW FUNCTIONALITY:
 ==================
  
 -- Adding VistaWeb to the CPRS Tools menu
  
 To access VistaWeb, CPRS originally used an entry on the CPRS Tools menu 
 as discussed in the informational patch OR*3.0*230. In CPRS GUI v.26, 
 developers added a way to make VistaWeb the default for viewing data from 
 other sites. This can be done in two ways: an option on the list when the 
 Remote Data button is selected will change the default to VistaWeb if 
 checked or a selection the user can make by choosing Tools | Options and 
 then going to the Reports tab. Users can choose to use VistaWeb as their 
 default or keep the current Remote Data Views as their default. 
 Because this option is available, sites can choose to remove the VistaWeb
 item from the Tools menu or leave it there. Refer to the OR*3*215 Release
 Notes for an example listing of the CPRS GUI Tools Menu with the VistaWeb
 option.
  
 Modifications:
 Changing the default sets a new parameter that stores the user preference 
 for Remote Data, ORWRP VISTAWEB:
  
 NAME: ORWRP VISTAWEB
 DISPLAY TEXT: Replace RDV with VistaWeb
 VALUE TERM: REPLACE RDV WITH VISTAWEB
 VALUE DATA TYPE: yes/no
 VALUE HELP: Enter YES to make VistaWeb the default for viewing remote 
 data.
  
 DESCRIPTION:
 This parameter determines which tool to use for viewing remote patient 
 data, VistaWeb or RDV (Remote Data Views).
  
         PRECEDENCE: 1   ENTITY FILE: USER
         PRECEDENCE: 2   ENTITY FILE: DIVISION
         PRECEDENCE: 3   ENTITY FILE: SYSTEM
         PRECEDENCE: 4   ENTITY FILE: PACKAGE
  
   - Developers added code that checks this parameter value for default 
     Remote Data preference.
   - The new RPC for parameter check is ORWCIRN VISTAWEB
   - The new RPC for changing parameter is ORWCIRN WEBCH
  
 Based on the value of the ORWRP VISTAWEB parameter, the Remote Data button
 invokes RDV or VistaWeb accordingly.
  
 Changes
  
   - The ORWRP VISTAWEB parameter can be edited in both CPRS Vista and GUI 
     parameter edit options.
   - This parameter is on the ORQP REPORT MGR MENU, which is accessed from 
     the GUI Parameters menu.
   - The parameter can also be edited from the GUI Tools Options menu item 
     and selecting the Reports Tab.
   - To make it easy to set VistaWeb as the user's default choice, 
     developers added a new item to the drop-down list of remote sites. The
     first item in the list of checkboxes is "Use WebVista from now on".
     When the user selects "Use WebVista from now on", the Remote Data
     button will then invoke the VistaWeb application.
   - To change back to RDV after changing this parameter to use VistaWeb, 
     users can go to the Tools | Options | Reports menu and reselect RDV,
     or ask a clinical coordinator to change the parameter from their menu
     in VistA.
  
 Instructions for Removing VistaWeb from CPRS Tools Menu
  
 Patch OR*3.0*230 gave a detailed explanation and instructions for adding 
 VistaWeb to the CPRS Tools Menu. If sites have added VistaWeb to the tools
 menu, they may now want to remove this option because CPRS v.26 has
 implemented VistaWeb as an alternative for RDV by allowing the Remote Data
 button bring up VistaWeb. Refer to the OR*3*215 Release Notes for
 instructions to remove VistaWeb from the tools menu.
  
 -- Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) / Allergies
  
 Causative Agent Not Found Informational Text Box: This dialog was 
 enhanced to provide additional instructions to the user.
  
 -- Blood Bank (VBECS) Order Dialog Enhancements
  
 Developers made changes to CPRS by including a new order dialog to support
 VBECS (VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software), however it won't be
 active or accessible until VBECS and OR*3.0*212 are both also installed.
 Additional CPRS changes are also planned for OR*3.0*243.
  
 -- CCOW User Context
  
 Developers added new support for the CCOW/User Context (UC) standard to 
 CPRS. With the appropriate Kernel patches installed, this support will
 enable single sign on for UC-aware GUI applications (e.g., CPRS, Care
 Management, or Vitals). If a user has logged in to a UC-aware application
 (entered their access and verify codes and gotten in), then while the
 application is still connected to VistA and the user then launches other
 GUI applications that are UC-aware, the user will not be required to enter
 access and verify codes again. This support works with Delphi clients, Web
 applications, and Java applications. Simplified sign-on and CCOW user
 context have been enabled. The default functionality is to proceed with 
 simplified sign-on, if all patches are in place, on both VistA and CCOW 
 vault.  The command-line parameter "CCOW=PATIENTONLY" will disable on a
 single shortcut basis.  For complete details, see documentation at:
 http://vista.med.va.gov/kernel/sso/download.asp#documentation
  
 For Shared PCs
 Developers added a new command-line parameter to allow enabling of 
 patient context without also enabling user context. This should alleviate 
 many of the problems reported by test sites related to workstations 
 shared by multiple users. To enable patient context, but not user 
 context, include the parameter CCOW=PATIENTONLY on the command line of 
 the shortcut, following CPRSChart.EXE and/or any other command-line 
 parameters. If the shortcut has several command-line parameters other 
 than CCOW= (such as SPLASH= or P=), where the CCOW parameter falls in the 
 order is not important, but only one "CCOW=" parameter 
 (DISABLE/FORCE/PATIENTONLY) may be used on any given shortcut. If more 
 than one CCOW= command-line parameter is included, CPRS will use the 
 first parameter it encounters (reading left to right).
  
 -- Consults
  
 The behavior of the ORWOR SHOW CONSULTS parameter and the "nag" screen has
 been modified in accordance with review by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup.
 The "Would you like to see a list..".  dialog has been eliminated. The new
 behavior is as follows:
  
 - Parameter set to NO
  
   The list of consults is not initially displayed on the note title 
   screen, regardless of whether there are pending consults the user is
   able to resolve. Clicking a Consults-class title will still display the
   list of unresolved consults, if any.
  
 - Parameter set to YES
  
   - If there are unresolved consults for the user, the user is presented 
     directly with the note title screen with the list of unresolved
     consults displayed.
   - If there are no unresolved consults for the user, the list of consults
     is not displayed on the note title screen. Clicking a Consults-class
     title will still display the list of consults. Once on the note title
     screen, if the user selects a consult, and then clicks a non-Consults
     title, a new warning is displayed, indicating that the selected title
     will not complete the selected consult:
   - If the user answers YES/CONTINUE with this title, the list of consults
     is hidden, and the user clicks OK as usual to start the note without
     completing a consult.
   - If the user answers NO, the selected title is deselected, the consults
     list remains visible, and the user is allowed to choose another title,
     and then click OK to continue with the completion of the consult.
  
 -- Enhanced Graphing
  
 CPRS developers added new graphing capabilities. The new features are 
 dependent on the new Clinical Reminders indexing tool. If the site has run
 the index, users will be able to graph numerical data such as lab results
 and vitals as well as episodes and events such as medications and exam
 dates. Graphing can be accessed from the Reports tab, the Labs tab, the
 Tools menu, or from any tab using the shortcut key Ctrl + G. On the
 Reports tab, the graphing pane is embedded in the tab, but from the other
 locations, the graphing features are launched is a separate window that
 can stay open while browsing the patient's chart. Essentially, users can
 graph anything anywhere. All types of data can be graphed together for
 comparisons within the same time frame. The user can display the
 information on the same graph to show the relationship between the two
 items or on separate graphs.
  
 -- HDR Support for Remote Data Views 
  
 - With HDR the Remote Data Button Will Only Turn Blue if Data Is Available
 from Sites Other than HDR: Developers added code to support Clinical
 Workgroup recommendations regarding HDR reports in the Reports Tab. The
 change modifies the trigger that causes the Remote Data button text to
 turn blue. If the HDR facility is included in the list, at least one
 additional facility must be included for the RDV button to turn blue.
  
 - Parameter to Control Remote Data Views Access to the HDR: CPRS 
 developers created a new parameter ORWRP HDR ON that controls whether a
 site will query the HDR for remote data. This parameter will be OFF when
 exported, so that sites will not be querying the HDR. (This item is also
 in another section of this document.)
  
 =======================================================================
 = WARNING: Sites should not enable this parameter until they receive  =
 = official instructions. There is the possibility that inaccurate or  =
 = misaligned data could be displayed in CPRS.  A future patch will    =
 = either provide instructions or activate the ORWRP HDR ON parameter. =
 =======================================================================
  
 -- Inpatient Medications for Outpatients (IMO)
  
 As stated in the OR*3.0*195 patch description, Inpatient Medications for 
 Outpatients (IMO) features will not be available in CPRS until patch
 SD*5.3*285. Because SD*5.3*285 is a required patch for OR*3.0*215, once
 OR*3.0*215 is installed IMO functionality will be available for use. Refer
 to the IMO Release Notes (PSJ_5_P121RN.doc) that will be released with
 patch PSJ*5*121.
  
 -- MyHealtheVet/Patient Insurance Identifier
  
 CPRS now has a button to quickly access a patient's MyHealtheVet or 
 patient insurance information. The button is located next to the Flag
 button. Unlike other buttons this button is only visible if the patient
 has MyHealtheVet information or insurance information. If the patient has
 neither, the button does not display. If the patient has one, but not the
 other, the button displays the wording for what the patient has. If the 
 patient has both, the top half of the button is labeled MHV and will
 access MyHealtheVet information, and the bottom half of the button is
 labeled Pt Insur and will bring up a detailed display with the patient's
 current insurance information. By placing the mouse over each part of the
 button, the hover hint indicates whether the patient has MyHealtheVet data
 or insurance information. 
  
 Note: The MyHealtheVet functionality will not begin to appear until My
 HealtheVet In Person Authentication is released.
  
 -- Non-VA Meds
  
 Non-VA Quick Orders:  Developers added the ability to create and use quick
 orders for non-VA medication orders. The non-VA quick orders can be
 autoaccepted.
  
 -- Notifications
  
 - Alert Sort Order Now Saves: Developers added code to save the direction
 of the alert sort direction (ascending or descending) in the CPRS GUI.
  
 - Separation of Notifications for Inpatient and Outpatient Expiring Orders
 (E3R 12229): Developers added a new notification, MEDICATIONS EXPIRING -
 OUTPT and changed the name of the notification MEDICATIONS EXPIRING to
 MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - INPT. MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - OUTPT will affect 
 orders entered on an outpatient, and MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - INPT will 
 affect orders entered on an inpatient.
  
 Note: Please be aware that if the MEDICATIONS EXPIRING - OUTPT
 notification is turned on, there is the potential for a significant
 increase in the number of alerts generated. Please thoroughly examine the
 parameters that control the generation of this new notification using the
 NOTIFICATION MGMT MENU options "Enable/Disable Notifications", "Set
 Default Recipient(s) for Notifications" and "Set Provider Recipients for
 Notifications".
  
 - CPRS GUI Parameter to Allow Deletion of Non-CPRS Alert Using Remove 
 Button (Remedy 70715, Remedy 70953, Remedy 70910, E3R 19155): Developers
 added a new parameter ORB REMOVE NON-OR to CPRS that enables sites to
 designate which non-CPRS (non-OERR) alerts that can be deleted without
 processing using the Remove button in the CPRS GUI. Sites can only set the
 ORB REMOVE NON-OR parameter at the System level.
  
 To use this parameter, sites enter the alert identifier (or the first few
 characters of the alert identifier) for each type of alert users can
 remove using the Remove button. The alert identifier or XQAID can be found
 in the ALERT ID field of the ALERT file [#8992]. For example, to remove
 NOIS alerts enter FSC as the parameter value. Sites may enter as many
 alert identifiers as desired to enable removing of multiple alert types.
  
 Note: Use caution when designating which alerts users should be allowed to
 remove. Entering too much information (characters of the alert ID) may not
 cover all types of the alerts. Only use that portion of the alert ID which
 is consistent for the alert type you wish to remove. Most alert IDs
 include information specific to the patient or instance which triggered
 the alert. For example, a NOIS alert's ID might actually look like
 FSC-M,275546. Entering the entire alert ID in this parameter will only
 allow removal of this specific alert. However if you use FSC for the
 parameter value, all NOIS alerts can be removed. Entering too little
 information could enable users to remove alerts that should not be
 removed.
  
 The following are examples of non-OR alert IDs: 
   - NO-ID;17;3040628.131502 [Taskman alert]   - use NO-ID in parameter
   - TIUERR,3423,1;1450;3040518.125801     [TIU error alert]  - use TIUERR
   - TIU28907;17;3040720.134827    [TIU alert]     - use TIU in parameter
  
 For the above examples, for instance, entering TIU will also enable 
 removing TIUERR alerts. Use TIUERR if you only want to remove TIUERR
 alerts.
  
 Refer to the OR*3*215 Release Notes for viewing the option path for
 setting the parameter to enable removing non-OR alerts, and for an example
 of finding an alert ID in FileMan.
  
 -- Orders
  
 Discontinuing an "Entered in Error" Order Generates a Bulletin: CPRS now 
 generates a bulletin when a user discontinues a drug order and the reason
 is "Entered in Error".  The new bulletin name is OR DRUG ORDER CANCELLED.
 The new bulletin will be sent to the new mail group named OR DRUG ORDER
 CANCELLED.
  
 -- Patient Record Flags, Phase II 
  
 Developers added the ability to show which Progress Note provides the 
 supporting clinical information for an assignment (new, activate,
 continue, entered in error, or inactivate) of a Patient Record Flag (PRF).
 The Progress Note title displays in the detailed display of a PRF. 
 Also, when a user selects the appropriate Progress Note title to provide
 the clinical reasons for a PRF, the user must choose to which flag
 assignment (activate, inactivate, continue, etc.) the note pertains. The
 user can no longer write the note first and then create the flag. 
 On the Patient Record Flags popup, CPRS now has an area that displays the
 signed linked notes that are related to the flag. Users can click an entry
 to bring up the related progress note in a separate detail window from
 which the note can be viewed or printed. 
  
 Please see patches TIU*1.0*184, USR*1.0*27, and DG*5.3*554 for more
 information.
  
 -- Program Enhancements for Outpatient Meals
  
 Developers have added code to CPRS version 26 to support the ordering of 
 recurring and special meals for outpatients, in conjunction with the
 release of Dietetics version 5.5. The same options that exist with
 inpatient diets are also available with outpatient meals: tubefeeding,
 early/late tray, isolation/precautions, and additional order. Dietetics
 5.5 must be installed for the outpatient meals functionality to be enabled
 in CPRS.
  
 Before users can order meals for outpatients, sites must set up the 
 following in the Nutrition & Food Service package:
  
   - Outpatient meal locations
   - Outpatient diets
   - To activate the "bagged meal" checkbox to appear in CPRS, the field 
     "PROVIDE BAGGED MEALS?" in the COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE file must be set
     to YES. It only appears on the Early/Late Tray tab, and on the popup
     Late Tray dialog.
  
 Sites will also need to do the following in the CPRS package:
     
   - Add order dialogs FHW SPECIAL MEAL and/or FHW OP MEAL to the CPRS 
     Write Orders order dialog so that it is available to users
  
 For special meals to auto-generate meal vouchers, CACs or other 
 individuals can give the Nutrition and Food Service key (FHAUTH) to some
 users so that when the user electronically signs the order, the meal
 voucher is authorized. If the user who signs the order does not have the
 FHAUTH key, the meal voucher will not be authorized until a wet signature
 is applied by an authorized individual.  Special meal vouchers include the
 initial letter of the patient's surname plus last 4 numbers of the
 patient's social security number (SSN) when printed from CPRS.
  
 As part of the install process, CPRS sets a value for three parameters 
 that control print format for the Outpatient meal ticket. These parameters
 are listed below and the value for the Dietetics package is shown in
 parenthesis following the name of the parameter. 
  
   - ORPF WARD REQUISITION HEADER (FH OUTPT MEAL HEADER) 
   - ORPF WARD REQUISITION FORMAT (FH OUTPT MEAL TICKET) 
   - ORPF WARD REQUISITION FOOTER (FH OUTPT MEAL FOOTER)
  
 These three print formats should not be altered.
  
 Outpatient meals will not auto-DC on admission unless an auto-DC rule is 
 created under the Event-Delayed Orders menu in CPRS. To make outpatient 
 meals discontinue when the patient is admitted, an ADMISSION rule should
 be created and include the Dietetics package.  Any recurring outpatient
 meal that is discontinued, whether manually or auto-dc'd, will also
 discontinue any associated early/late trays, tube feedings, and additional
 orders.
  
 - Displaying Outpatient Meals Ordered prior to CPRS v.26 Installation
  
 Patch FH*5.5*2, released 3/2/2006, includes a routine [FHPST2] which can 
 be run to update the Orders (#100) file with any outpatient meals ordered 
 in VISTA prior to CPRS v26.  The FHPST2 routine does not need to be run 
 until AFTER CPRS v26 is installed.  Running the FHPST2 routine in an 
 environment that does not have CPRS v26 will NOT cause any damage.  The 
 routine will simply error out since the CPRS v26 routines are not yet 
 present.  Once CPRS v26 is installed the update can be run at anytime.
  
 The Clinical Application Coordinators and the Nutrition & Food Service 
 ADPAC/Staff should discuss the advantages of running this routine which 
 are described below.
  
 CPRS v26 allows ordering outpatient meals through CPRS - up until now you 
 could only order through VistA options - because of this change the 
 routine FHPST2 will allow the data previously entered in VistA to show on 
 the CPRS orders tab.
  
 If you have not implemented outpatient meals prior to the installation of 
 CPRS v26 you do not need to do anything.  Just as a reminder, implementing
 outpatient meals is OPTIONAL.
  
 If you are running outpatient meals now, once the new CPRS v26 is 
 installed you will not be able to see outpatient meal data entered before 
 CPRS v26 was installed you will only be able to see orders entered after 
 the installation.   If you want to be able to view this "historical" data 
 (-i.e. entered before CPRS v26) then IRMS should run this routine.  If it 
 is not important to view the past data in CPRS then IRMS does not have to 
 run the routine. 
  
 -- Progress Notes Text Search
  
 Developers added a new text search feature. This feature searches the 
 current list of notes to find all notes that contain the exact text that a
 user enters and then displays those notes in the treeview of the Notes
 tab.
  
 -- Reminders
  
 Before CPRS v.26, any Reminder that received an M error or the Due Status 
 could not be determine, the Reminder would not display on the Cover Sheet.
 Now with Reminders 2.0 and CPRS v.26, the following occurs:
  
   - If the Reminder receives an M error, the Reminder will appear on the 
     cover sheet with a status of Error. If the user clicks on the Reminder
     the Clinical Maintenance window displays with a message reading
     "Contact your Clinical Reminders Coordinator".
   - If the Due Status could not be determined, the Reminder displays on 
     the Cover Sheet with a status of "CNBD". Please refer to the Clinical
     Reminders 2.0 manual for more detail information.
  
 -- Remote Data Views (RDV)
  
 Developers enhanced the current RDV feature on the Reports tab to support 
 the display of clinical data stored in the Health Data Repository 
 Historical (HDR-Hx) and Health Data Repository Interim Messaging Solution 
 (HDR-IMS). When ready, these two databases will include clinical data 
 from all Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs), and in the 
 future, some Department of Defense data as well.
 Patient data housed in the HDR-Hx and HDR-IMS databases shall display 
 on the Reports tab in the same manner that data from other VAMCs and 
 Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE) is now displayed. 
  
 Note: The enhanced RDV changes shall remain dormant until such time that
 the HDR and Clinical Data Services (CDS) are ready to receive and transmit
 data. At that time patch OR*3.0*238 will be released to implement the
 enhancements.
  
 -- Scheduling Redesign Changes
  
 CPRS now includes support for the new Scheduling changes. In preparation 
 for future Scheduling package changes, developers modified CPRS to
 properly handle situations when the Scheduling system is unavailable. If
 the Scheduling system was unavailable, CPRS users would not be able to do
 certain things such as using a patient's list of clinic visits, defining a
 personal list using clinics, and viewing future appointments on patients.
 The other functions of CPRS would continue; users could still select any
 patient and get just about any information other than appointment data. 
 Users could still lookup clinic names and get patient demographics, etc.
  
 -- Support for Patient Financial Services System (PFSS)
  
 The purpose of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) project is to 
 help automate the billing process by sending needed billing information to
 the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) billing replacement software. The CPRS
 portion of the PFSS project consists of two phases. The first phase is
 contained in CPRS v26. Thus CPRS developers have made several changes to
 CPRS v26 for PFSS. These changes have no affect on any of the sites unless
 the PFSS parameter (ORWPFSS ACTIVE) is defined and activated. Even upon
 activation, the sites should see no change to CPRS functionality. The only
 sites which should define and activate the PFSS parameter are the PFSS
 test sites. All other sites should not be affected.
  
 The following changes were made to CPRS v26 for PFSS, however the code is 
 controlled by the ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter and will remain off at all 
 sites, except those testing PFSS:
  
   - The parameter ORWPFSS ACTIVE, when defined and activated, will cause 
     the patient visit string to be stored in the ORDER file (# 100). The
     patient visit string functionality has been in CPRS for several years
     but never activated. Note that the ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter must be
     defined and activated. The ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter is defined and
     managed through the routine ORWPFSS0.
   - In addition to the ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter, developers added new 
     Radiology and Laboratory order dialogs. These enable the patient visit
     string data to be stored in the ORDER file (# 100) when the parameter
     ORWPFSS ACTIVE is defined and activated.
   - Additional changes to the CPRS GUI to support passing the visit 
     string, but the changes have no affect unless the ORWPFSS ACTIVE
     parameter is defined and active.
  
 Note: The ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter will not be utilized in phase two of 
 the CPRS PFSS project. Its function will be replaced by an IBB parameter.
 Thus, the ORWPFSS ACTIVE parameter is used only for testing the storage of
 the patient visit string in CPRS v26.
  
 -- Vitals
  
 CPRS will use a new Vitals component enabling users to enter modifiers 
 with vitals, such as standing, sitting, right arm, left arm, etc. Graphing
 tools are also included with new component. This feature requires a new
 dynamic link library (GMV_VitalsViewEnter.dll) that must be present for
 the new vitals features to run correctly; refer to GMRV*5*3 for more
 information. 
  
 Vitals and modifiers can now be entered via the GUI by clicking on the
 Cover Sheet or through the vitals tab on the encounter form (Remedy
 69670).
  
 -- VistaWeb Parameter Added
  
 A new parameter has been created to allow sites to edit the web address
 that points to the VistaWeb interface. Prior to this change, the web
 address was hard coded in Delphi. Now sites can change this parameter for
 testing in test accounts, or if the VistaWeb web address changes in the
 future. The new parameter is ORWRP VISTAWEB ADDRESS. The parameter value
 should not include any parameters because they will be calculated when the
 request is made. For example, if the VistaWeb address is:
  
 https://vhaiswwebv7.vha.med.va.gov/vistaweb/ToolsPage.aspx?q9gtw0=660&xqi4
 z=%DFN&yiicf=%DUZ
  
 the value of ORWRP VISTAWEB ADDRESS should be:
 https://vhaiswwebv7.vha.med.va.gov/vistaweb/ToolsPage.aspx
  
 If no value is entered for this parameter, then CPRS will default to: 
 https://vistaweb.med.va.gov
  
 DEFECT FIXES:
 =============
  
 -- Allergies
  
 - Support for Allergy Synonyms: Developers added support for synonyms, if
 present, in the SIGNS/SYMPTOMS selection box.
  
 - Marking Allergies as Entered in Error Now Controlled by Parameter 
 (OR*3.0*195 Known Issue # 1): In CPRS v25, any user could enter new 
 allergies, mark a patient as NKA (no known allergies), and mark allergies 
 entered in error from the cover sheet and the detailed display window. In 
 v.26, the Entered in Error option requires the new parameter OR ALLERGY 
 ENTERED IN ERROR to be enabled for the user. The other options remain open
 to all users as before. This parameter may be set at the system, user
 class, and the user level. 
  
 - Message Now Includes the Same Warning: The "Bulletin has been sent"
 message that CPRS displays after the user requests the addition of a new 
 causative agent now includes the same warning included in the bulletin 
 about that reactant not being added to the patient's record.
  
 - Backspace to Clear Severity Results in Last Entry Displayed Storing: In
 the Enter Allergy/Adverse Reaction dialogue if the user selects a severity
 and then backspaces to clear that entry, the record is stored with the
 last severity displayed in that field. It should have stored with NO
 SEVERITY, severity in not a required field. This could result in incorrect
 severity status being associated with the entry.
  
 - If 39 or More Signs/Symptoms Are Entered in Enter Allergy/Adverse 
 Reaction Dialog, CPRS Returns an M Error: If 39 or more signs/symptoms are
 entered in Enter Allergy/Adverse Reaction dialog, CPRS returns an M error,
 kicks the user out of CPRS, and locks up the Cover Sheet for that patient
 for all users. If users have the Cover Sheet set up as their default tab,
 they get kicked out as soon as they open this patient. If another tab is
 their default, users are kicked out if they select the Cover sheet for
 this patient. If users select the patient on which this error has occurred
 and select postings (the CWAD button, which indicated there are Allergies
 for the patient) from any tab, they get the same M error. If the Allergy
 is marked Entered in Error from the ART package, the Allergy display and
 the Cover Sheet for that patient return to normal.
  
 - Comments Can Be Blank Although Parameter Is Set To Require Originator 
 Comments For Observed/Drug Allergy: When the GMR Site Allergy Parameters 
 are set to require comments during entry of an observed drug allergy, if 
 text is entered into the comment section and then cleared out, the record 
 is stored with a blank allergy text. If there is no attempt to enter 
 comment text at all, the user gets a message that comments are required.
  
 - Free-Text Signs and Symptoms No Longer Allowed: To support data 
 standardization efforts, developers removed the ability to enter free-text
 signs/symptoms. Users must now select items from the list of available
 signs/symptoms.
  
 - Inconsistent Sending of Bulletin for Marked on Chart: CPRS always sent 
 the "Marked on Chart" bulletin if the user entered an allergy from the 
 Orders tab. CPRS never sent the bulletin if the user entered the allergy 
 from the Cover Sheet. This inconsistency has been corrected, and CPRS will
 never send the bulletin when the user enters a new allergy (regardless of
 whether it is entered from the Orders tab or Cover Sheet).
  
 - Missing Scroll Bar on Allergy "Entered in Error" Form: On the form to 
 mark an allergy as Entered in Error, the Comments box did not provide a 
 vertical scroll bar for lengthy comments. 
  
 - Blank Symptom Error (Remedy 90006): The error 
 <SUBSCRIPT>UPDATE+34^GMRAGUI1 was occurring when a blank symptom was 
 entered. This has been fixed.
  
 - Allergy Dialog Embedded in a Clinical Reminder No Longer Available 
 (Remedy 110527, OR*3.0*195 Known Issue # 6): When you click on the box 
 that is supposed to call up the allergy dialog, the allergy dialog does 
 not display. This has been fixed.
  
 - Allergy Signs/Symptoms Entered with a Double-Click Cause Allergy 
 Comments To Be Deleted (Remedy 133444): When an allergy is entered by 
 double-clicking on the signs/symptoms and then allergy comments are 
 entered, the allergy comments are deleted when the OK button is selected. 
 Because of this the allergy comments are not viewable when the allergy is 
 selected, and they are not stored in VISTA. This has been fixed.
  
 -- CCOW
  
 - CCOW Disconnect Problems Corrected: Developers added code to handle a 
 CCOW disconnect problem. Now if the user's connection to the context vault
 fails, CPRS will display an appropriate error message, and the user can
 continue in most cases. In previous versions, such disconnects often 
 required that CPRS close.
  
 - CCOW Not Breaking Context Correctly: If CPRS begins a patient change and
 the user chooses to break context because of work in progress in another
 application, CPRS would refresh the current patient's information instead
 of loading the newly selected patient's information. This has been
 corrected.
  
 - Context Change Not Allowed with New Vitals Functionality: If another
 application (A) , or another instance of CPRS (A), attempts a patient
 change while one instance of CPRS (B) has the Vitals DLL window open, CPRS
 (B) will be unable to respond to the CCOW survey from the vault requesting
 permission.  In that case, (A) will display a dialog, provided by
 Sentillion, with "Cancel" and "Break" buttons enabled.  If the user
 chooses "Cancel", the original (A) patient will be redisplayed, and no
 patient change will occur in (A).  If the user chooses "Break", (A) will
 break from context and change patients, leaving (B) in context with the
 original patient.  There is extensive documentation of all of this
 behavior in the HL7 CCOW standards documentation, as well as in the 
 documentation from Sentillion.
  
 - Size of CCOW Icons Increased: In response to site concerns about CCOW 
 icon visibility and prominence, developers increased the size of the CCOW 
 icons next to the patient name block.
  
 - CCOW Link Incorrectly Displaying as Linked: If a user has two instances
 of CPRS open and is connected to two different VistA accounts, selecting a
 new patient in one will correctly display the "No Patient Selected" screen
 in the other. If the user then chooses to select a new patient in that
 disabled copy, but cancels from the patient selection screen, the previous
 patient for that copy will be displayed, and the CCOW icon will display as
 "linked". There will then be two different patients displayed on the
 screen, both appearing as linked to the patient context. This has been
 corrected by reverting to the "No Patient Selected" screen if the user
 cancels, if that screen had previously been displayed.
  
 - Rejoin/Set New Context Causes Loss of Note Text for an Unsigned Note 
 (Remedy 120996): A provider started a new note in CPRS GUI and it had 
 several lines of text. She realized that she needed further data from 
 VistAWeb but noted that the link was broken for her current CPRS session. 
 She then clicked on File | Rejoin | Set New Context and that switched her 
 from the Notes tab to the Cover Sheet. She then accessed VistAWeb using 
 the Tools menu, obtained the needed data from another facility, and closed
 VistAWeb. The CPRS session was still up and open. She clicked back to the
 Notes tab where she saw the unsigned note with the header of title, date,
 author, etc. but the note text was gone. This has been corrected.
  
 -- CIDC
  
 - HNC Check Box Not Updating Correctly: If a user entered a problem for a
 patient and indicated that it was associated with Head and Neck Cancer 
 (HNC) and then selected a prosthetics consult and chose that problem, the 
 HNC check box should have been checked, but it was not. The HNC checkbox 
 should now update correctly.
  
 - CIDC Info Incorrectly Required for Discontinued Orders (Remedy 119371):
 Orders that are discontinued by a nurse and require a provider's signature
 no longer require entry of a diagnosis.
  
 - Prompt Providers for CIDC Information Only for Patients with Active 
 Insurance: This feature was added to v26.
  
 - Inability to Sign Consult Orders: CIDC providers frequently are unable 
 to sign consult orders; they receive a message that the consult needs a 
 diagnosis although consult order do not require one, and it is even 
 indicated as "N/A". Developers changed CPRS to ensure that orders with N/A
 status do not require a diagnosis.
  
 - Sign Orders Window Not Forcing User to Enter Diagnosis: On the Sign 
 Orders window, if the user unchecked the treatment factors and signed the 
 orders, CPRS did not prompt users to enter a diagnosis for each order. 
 Developers changed this and CPRS will now require CIDC users to enter a 
 diagnosis.
  
 - CIDC-related Record Locking Causes Undefined Error (OR*3.0*195 Known 
 Issue # 5): When users are placing orders, very infrequently an invalid 
 order IEN is stored in the ORDER file (# 100) specifically, the second
 node of ^OR(100 resulting in orders being locked on the users at the
 ancillary level and an undefined error occurring in routine ORWDXR. This
 error has only been reported by two of the four OR*3.0*195 test sites that
 have installed both CPRS GUI v.25 (OR*3*195) and CIDC and have enabled
 CIDC. To correct this, sites either installed the released OR*3.0*229
 patch if the site has CPRS v25 installed or installed CPRS v26.
  
 -- Consults
  
 - Unknown Significant Findings Problem Corrected (Remedy 70231): 
 Regardless of the value selected for "Significant Findings", the value 
 stored was the ampersand (&) character, which was subsequently treated as 
 if "Unknown" had been selected. This has been corrected. 
  
 - <Space Bar> Changed to Not Select Item: If users were ordering a consult
 from the "generic" consult dialog window and the user pressed the <Space
 Bar> while trying to type in the Consult Service name, the consult that
 was listed before pressing the <Space Bar> was automatically selected.
 Developers made the <Space Bar> enter a space rather than select an item.
  
 - Drawer Missing on Consults Tab (Remedy 95278): Developers corrected the
 problem of the Consults tab drawers not displaying.
  
 - Consults Dialog Navigation Problem (Remedy 95986): If a user tabbed off
 of the "New Procedure" button, CPRS frequently gave a "cannot focus 
 disabled or invisible window" error. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -- Encounter
  
 - Workload Will No Longer Be Required for Non-Count Clinics (Remedy 70381)
  
 - Some Codes Not Available in Lexicon Look Up on the Encounter Form and 
 Consults Tab for Procedures (Remedy 85910): When a provider went to look 
 up a procedure, the code that the provider was looking for did not appear.
 In this case, codes 12001, 12002, 12007 were not available to provider
 when searching for Repair of Superficial Wounds. The Lexicon look up did
 display codes 12004, 12005, and 12006, but not the other choices.
 Developers corrected the problem and CPRS now displays all the appropriate
 codes. 
  
 - Reminder Dialog Visit Information Prompts Are Not Enabled when the Same 
 Prompts Are Enabled on the Encounter Form (Remedy 114557): The visit 
 information requested on the Encounter form did not match the visit 
 information requested from reminder dialogs. When a user opened the 
 encounter form on an outpatient and specific visit information needed to 
 be entered (i.e., SC, Combat Vet, etc.), if the user opened a reminder 
 dialog that contained a Visit button, the same visit information did not 
 show as needing to be entered.
  
 - Length of Comment Field on Encounter Form Changed (Remedy 70222):
 Developers changed the Comment field on the Health Factor tab of the 
 Encounter Form to accept only 245 characters. This stops the data loss.
  
 -- Event Capture Interface
  
 Event Capture Report Can Now Be Viewed (Remedy 70642): Previously, CPRS 
 users who did not have the "EC GUI CONTEXT" menu option could not view the
 event capture report on Reports tab. This has been corrected. 
  
 -- Graphing
  
 Reference range displayed on graph in CPRS GUI (Remedy 69284): In the 
 LABORATORY TEST file (# 60) for the test ALT, a new site/specimen was
 added (PLASMA) with a new reference range. On the CPRS GUI Labs tab, if
 the user selected Graph, the graph displayed the patient's results for the
 date range selected. Within the range selected, there were results for
 serum and plasma, but the reference range displayed on the graph is for
 the serum only, and not the plasma. This was corrected in that specimens
 are now split as separate graphs.
  
 -- Labs
  
 Grid Index Out of Range Error Corrected (Remedy 69456): Developers 
 corrected a "Grid Index Out of Range" error on the Labs tab.
  
 -- Miscellaneous
  
 - Corrected a Rare "<PARAMETER> VARVAL^XWBLIB" Server Error Occurring 
 when a User Clicked on a Tools Menu Item (Remedy 71079)
  
 - Hidden Windows: Developers added a change to CPRS that should address 
 the issue of CPRS windows coming up behind other windows and causing the 
 appearance that CPRS is locked up. 
  
 - Subscribe to Team Combo Box Problem: The Subscribe to a team combo box 
 under Tools | Options | Lists/Teams was not behaving consistently, whether
 using the mouse or the keyboard. The confirmation message should now
 appear on the first try, instead of the second.
  
 - Remove OTHER from Location Selection Lists in CPRS (Remedy 114751):
 Hospital locations of type "Other", coded as "Z" in the HOSPITAL 
 LOCATION file (# 44), will no longer be selectable as locations for new
 visits. This change was endorsed by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup on Dec 14,
 2005. Only locations of type "Clinic" ("C") will now be selectable.
  
 - Inactive CPT Codes Are Selectable in CPRS when Using Clinical Lexicon 
 to Search for CPT Procedures (Remedy 85748): A site reported having this 
 occur on more than one procedure. One example is upon searching for code 
 11441, the user didn't know the code so "benign" was entered at the search
 prompt. At that point, the inactive version of that code was the only
 selectable choice for code 11441. The provider then chose the inactive
 code and it appeared that the system accepted the code and the provider
 exited the encounter. The routine ORWPCE was modified to restrict
 selection of inactive CPT codes to correct this problem.
  
 - Problem with Location for Current Activities (Remedy 92847): On the 
 visit selection screen, if a clinic with a very long name appeared in the 
 list of clinic appointments, the status of that appointment would not be 
 visible without causing a hover hint to display the full width of the line
 item. This problem was first reported in CPRS v.23 and has now been 
 corrected.
  
 - Unable to Choose a Printer No Dialog Box (Remedy 95594): When users were
 trying to print Progress Notes and had more than one Windows Printers set
 up, the notes were automatically printing to the default Windows Printer.
 They used to be able to choose which Windows Printer they wanted.
 Resolution: A Windows printer dialog box now executes when File | Print is
 selected.
  
 - The Help File Has Been Changed to Show "D - Alert Date/Time" for 
 Sorting Notifications Using the Keyboard (Remedy 70891): Users who do not
 use the mouse can sort Notifications in ascending order (alphabetical 
 order or most recent Date/Time) using only the keyboard. When users sort 
 using the Ctrl + <key> combination, CPRS will recognize either upper or 
 lower case letters (this feature is not case-sensitive). Users can sort 
 Notifications using a number of Ctrl + <key> combinations.
  
 - Corrected Error <SUBSCRIPT>LISTN+2^XTER1A that Occurred when RPC ORVAA 
 VAA Was Invoked (Remedy 98025)
  
 - User Cannot Change Font Size in CPRS (Remedy 71244): Upon setting the 
 font size larger in CPRS, some of the action buttons no longer appeared. 
 This has been corrected. 
  
 - JAWS Problem Opening Note from Notification: When processing 
 notifications the user may now press <Enter> to process the notification.
  
 - Consult Ordering: Can't Select Service/Specialty when Quick Orders 
 Exist: The arrow keys can now be used to navigate the Consult Dialog 
 Service/Specialty list.
  
 -- Non-VA Meds
  
 - NON-VA MEDS Missing the Frequency (Remedy 97562): If a provider enters a
 NON-VA MED and defines the dose, route, and frequency, then the 
 "pseudo-order" contains all of the parts. Once verified then it becomes 
 active. If a user then views this data on the Meds tab, on Reports tab 
 under the Ad hoc for NON-VA MEDS, or in patient data objects for templates
 that bring in the active medications, then it has all the parts of the
 order except the frequency. If a user then views this on the orders tab,
 it is shown correctly there. 
  
 - Non-VA Med Entry Shows Up Initially in the Inpatient Medication Section 
 and then Transfers to the Appropriate Section on the Meds Tab Display 
 after It Has Been Signed (Remedy 70852): This has confused staff who 
 cancelled their entry and did not enter non VA meds because they appeared 
 to be inpatient meds. This has been corrected.
  
 - Entire Non-VA Med Sig Not Displaying on the Meds Tab: This has been 
 corrected to display the entire Sig.
  
 - Non-VA Meds Cannot Focus on Invisible or Disabled Window: If a user 
 attempted to right-click on the yellow Info box on the Non-VA Meds dialog,
 CPRS displayed the error: Cannot Focus on Invisible or Disabled Window.
 Developers have corrected this problem.
  
 - Non-VA Meds PRN Orders Do Not Expand Correctly: If users enter a Non-VA
 Med order with PRN, the PRN does not expand to read "as needed" in the
 Sig. field at the bottom of the dialog. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Schedule for Non-VA Medication Orders Not Retained when Changing the 
 Order: When changing a Non-VA medication order, the schedule and/or the 
 PRN indication was not retained from the original order. Developers 
 corrected this problem.
  
 - Non-VA Meds Order PRN Indication Not Clearing: If a user was entering 
 Non-VA Medication orders, checked the PRN box, accepted an order, and then
 began another Non-VA Medication Order, the PRN box stayed checked from one
 entry to the next. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Non-VA Medication Order Drug Selection List Not Scrolling Appropriately:
 In the Non-VA Medication Order dialog if a user typed a few characters,
 the list did not scroll so that medications beginning with those letters
 displayed. For example, if a user entered "asp", the list should scroll to
 the medications beginning with "asp" such as aspirin, but it did not.
 Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -- Notes/Consults/Discharge Summary/Surgery Tabs
  
 - Default Note Title Note Being Automatically Highlighted: If a TIU 
 default title was assigned to a user and the user started a new note, CPRS
 did not highlight the default note title for selection. Developers 
 corrected this problem. 
  
 - Cosignature Requirement Now Based on Document Date (Remedy 84578): 
 Developers changed the code so that the evaluation of cosignature 
 requirement is now based on the document date, not the current date. This 
 change will occur after sites install patch TIU*1.0*175.
  
 - Removed Additional Signer Still Appearing (Remedy 70686): If a user was
 adding additional signers for a document and then removed some of the 
 names from the list before clicking OK, those erroneous entries were 
 sometimes still appearing with the document as additional signers. This 
 occurred for any name in the list that also had a title (e.g., M.D., 
 Pharmacist, HIM, etc.) appended to the name in the left-hand lookup box. 
 This has been corrected. 
  
 - List of Unresolved Consults Displays Inappropriately: If a user had a 
 TIU default note title defined that was not in the Consults document class
 of titles, then the list of unresolved consults that normally displayed
 when beginning a new note did not display, regardless of the value of the
 ORWOR SHOW CONSULTS parameter. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Title Will Not Resolve Consult Warning: When the user begins a new note
 and the list of unresolved consults is visible because of a YES setting
 for parameter ORWOR SHOW CONSULTS, CPRS displays a warning if the user
 selects any non-consults title that the selected title cannot be used to
 complete consults. No consult needs to be previously selected from the
 list for this warning to appear. If the user's default TIU title is a
 non-consults title, that title will still be preselected when the form
 displays, but the above warning will not appear until the user clicks OK.
  
 - Very Easy to Bypass Reason for Request (Remedy 71208): When ordering a 
 new consult in CPRS v25, unless the user actively clicks on the consult 
 name, under Consult to Service/Specialty, the user can proceed directly to
 typing in a reason for request, and completely bypass existing 
 prerequisites and templated reason for request. Consequently, consults can
 be submitted with missing, incomplete, or erroneous information in the
 reason for request. This has been fixed.
  
 - User Able to Sign Consult Request Without Completing Diagnosis (Remedy 
 94656): If a Service name was highlighted (but not selected) and the 
 consult request could be processed without entering a Provisional 
 diagnosis by using the Diagnosis button, even though it's set to required
 for that service in the REQUEST SERVICES file (# 123.5).
  
 - Site Not Receiving IFCs (Remedy 71016): Developers limited the maximum 
 length of the Provisional Diagnosis entry box to 180 characters to match 
 the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (# 123) file data dictionary. The previously
 unlimited length was causing intermittent messaging problems with
 interfacility consults (IFCs) if a user exceeded this length. There should
 be no noticeable impact to most users with this change, which included the
 ordering and edit/resubmit screens for both consults and procedures.
  
 - Selecting TIU Default Location No Longer Requires Additional Click 
 (Remedy 95758): Previously, if a user began a new TIU note, had a default
 TIU location defined, and was required to enter a visit location, the
 dialog appeared to have the default location selected, but it did not. The
 dialog required the user to explicitly select the location. Developers
 corrected this so that the default location is selected by default, and
 the user can then click or select OK to proceed. 
  
 - Cosignature Dialog Problem Addressed: Developers previously corrected a
 "List Index Out of Bounds" error on the cosigner selection box that 
 occurred if the user exited that box with no text entered. Developers 
 addressed the situation where partial text is entered but no match found.
  
 - Treeview No Longer Expands to Show Addenda During Keyword Search: When a
 user is doing a keyword search on note subjects or titles from the Custom
 View menu option, if the only reason for a parent document to be expanded
 in the left-hand treeview is the fact that its addendum also matches the
 search criteria, then that parent will NOT be expanded. If the user has
 the listview above the note text pane open (such as when the user selects
 the All signed Notes note grouping), addenda will still appear as matching
 items in that listview.
  
 - Cannot Create Addendum to a Document Requiring Cosigner (Remedy 97133):
 If a document required a cosigner based on TIU document parameter
 settings, and that document also allowed only one note per visit, it was
 impossible to create an addendum to that type of document. CPRS improperly
 enforced the "one note per visit" rule from the note title selection
 screen for addenda. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Changes Made to Spelling and Grammar Checking to Correct Problems: When
 clicking the spelling or grammar check menus, the first thing that happens
 is a forced silent autosave of the note's current text prior to passing
 that text to the MS-Word spell-checker. Developers added an additional
 automatic autosave of the note text immediately upon return from the
 spelling and grammar checks on the Notes, Consults, Discharge Summary, and
 Surgery tabs. This will now occur with no user action. Those autosaves
 have been enhanced so that the note text will be placed in the "TEXT  
 nodes of the document in the TIU DOCUMENT file (# 8925), instead of in the
 edit buffer's "TEMP  nodes. The effect of this change will be that if a
 spell-check error occurs and the user gets kicked out of CPRS, when the
 user goes back in and selects that note, the text will be visible and
 editable automatically, allowing a complete recovery. Depending on the
 exact code location/timing of the still-unknown spell-check error, the
 note may or may not include any changes made during the spell-check.
  
 - Notes Tab Consults Addendum Cosignature Issue Corrected: On the Notes 
 tab, if the user were adding an addendum to a consults-titled document 
 that requires cosignature, the addendum will also require cosignature, and
 the cosigner selection screen will display. Previously, CPRS required the
 user to select a consult on that screen, and the cosigner box would be
 hidden behind that consult selection box. Developers corrected both 
 problems. Additionally, if the user cancelled from that screen, the 
 addendum would still be opened for editing. Developers also corrected this
 problem.
  
 - Unable to Locate Active User (Remedy 98681): Terminated and disusered 
 users were being excluded from the selection list for Notes by author, as 
 well as in the Notes - custom view and the Problem List Filters screen. 
 The problem was that users, now inactive, may have once written notes or 
 added problems. Since inactive users were being excluded from the 
 selection list, there was no way to do a search of items limited to that 
 author. This has been corrected.
  
 - User Able to Sign Addendum without Identifying Cosigner (Remedy 70528):
 Users (residents) could make and sign addenda without specifying a
 cosigner that would otherwise require a cosigner. Here is how this can 
 happen: 
  
   1. Right click on document or go to action then make addendum. 
   2. ADDENDUM PROPERTIES' pops open and prompts for a cosigner. 
   3. The expected cosigner field can be left blank and user clicks on the 
      CANCEL button. 
   4. A blank addendum opens and user types in text. 
   5. Click on file and SELECT NEW PATIENT and user is then able to sign 
      addendum and not be prompted for a cosigner. 
   6. Status of addendum is UNCOSIGED without a cosigner specified. 
  
 This has been corrected.
  
 -- Notifications
  
 - ORMTIME Notifications Not Being Triggered (Remedy 70734): Developers 
 corrected a problem that occurred when trying to trigger ORMTIME-driven 
 notifications if an order does not contain a specific piece of information
 (a "3" global node). When an order is being updated due to recent/new
 activity, this piece of information will not exist in the order. This has
 been corrected. 
  
 - The Package-Level Value for ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS Did Not Make It into 
 the Post Init for OR*3*190 (Remedy 71062): OR*3*215 exports the Package 
 level value for ORWOR EXPIRED ORDERS.  Prior to OR*3*215, no value existed
 at the Package level and the software would search for med orders that
 have expired. Essentially it would not find any expired orders. If sites
 have this parameter set at the System level, they should check to ensure
 that it is set correctly.  
  
 - Experiencing a Very Long Delay when Accessing a Patient's Active 
 Medications (Remedy 70274): There is a distinct correlation noticed on 
 response time when performing a detailed display on a medication that 
 contains a long medication history. Waits of 1-2 minutes have been the 
 average for processing patient orders within the GUI. CPRS GUI v26 was 
 modified to NOT look back more than 90 days for orders when processing the
 remote procedure call (RPC) ORWORB KILLUNVER MEDS ALERT. The fix was also
 extended to RPC ORWORB KILL UNVER ORDERS ALERT that acts similarly. These
 RPCs are commonly called in the CPRS GUI to clean up related alerts.
  
 - Upon Forwarding Alerts, Sometimes Get RESETUP+4^XQALFWD (Remedy 125632):
 This has been fixed; ORB31 was modified to prevent the error.
  
 - Corrected <UNDEFINED>DEL+2^ORB3FUP1 Error: This occurred when a user 
 processed the same notification which had been processed by a different 
 user.
  
 -- Orders
  
 - Drug Message Not Displaying (Remedy 70639): In an order dialog, if a 
 user clicked the "Change" button to select a new drug, the drug message 
 did not display. This has been corrected.
  
 - Number of Medication Refills Not Calculating Correctly (Remedy 70657):
 The CPRS outpatient medication order dialog was not correctly calculating 
 the number of refills for outpatient medications. Developers corrected 
 this problem.
  
 - Flagging an Order Can Cause CPRS to Send Notifications to Incorrect 
 Providers (Remedy 71152): "FLAGGED ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION" alerts were 
 sent to providers other than those specified by the notification's 
 Provider Recipient parameter. In the reported instance, the site 
 pharmacist flagged the order to notify the ordering provider of the need 
 to renew the expiring medications. The site had the notification set to go
 to the ordering provider only. However, additional providers also received
 the notification. This was caused in the GUI by flagging an order and
 naming one or more additional recipients for the notification. If the user
 then flagged another order in the same CPRS session, CPRS did not clear
 the additional recipients and they received the notification also. This
 has now been corrected.
  
 - One-Time Schedule Still Appearing when Creating a Complex Inpatient 
 Order: Developers made some changes and CPRS now behaves as follows:
  
   - One-time schedules will not display in the schedule selection
     drop-down box for inpatient complex orders. 
   - If the user selects a one-time schedule on the dosage tab and then
     switches to the complex tab, the schedule field will be blank. 
   - If the user selects a schedule on the Dosage tab that is not a
     one-time schedule and then switches to the complex tab, the selected
     schedule should appear in the Schedule field.
  
 - Date Range for Orders Not Current (Remedy 70202): If users set the 
 orders view to a date range that goes back 3 months through NOW, showing 
 all orders and all services, CPRS does not always display the most recent 
 orders, regardless of order status. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Radiology Ordering Dialog Problem (Remedy 111354): If users did a 
 "Change" for RAD/VASC/NUC MED orders, the image type/location reverted to 
 blank and the date to today. Developers corrected this problem. 
  
 - Incorrect Orderable Item Selected (Remedy 95917): If a user edited an 
 unreleased order and selected a different orderable item, CPRS incorrectly
 entered a different orderable item from the one that was selected.
  
 - Two Orderable Dispense Drugs, Only One Message Shows: If there are two 
 dispense drugs under the same orderable item with different messages in 
 the message field, only one of the messages will show in the pop up box in
 CPRS. This has been fixed so that both messages display.
  
 - Corrected <UNDEFINED>RENEW+51^ORWDXR Errors: Developers added code to 
 insure records without a valid order ID will not be sent to routine 
 ORWDBA1.
  
 - Corrected Grammar So Messages Now Read:
  
   - You cannot renew the clinical medication order
   - You cannot place inpatient medication orders from a clinic location 
     for selected patient.
   - You cannot renew inpatient medication orders from a clinic location 
     for selected patient.
  
 - Removed Any Leading Spaces from Free-Text Entered Schedule: This was 
 done because the schedule was not expanding to read correctly, but the 
 user was allowed to accept the order.
  
 - Duration Field on Complex Medication Orders No Longer Allows Non 
 Numeric Character Inputs: The warning message reads: "Please use numeric 
 characters only."
  
 - Change Made to Retain the Last Day-Of-Week when PRN Is Entered Manually:
 Previously, the last day of the schedule was not retained.
  
 - Auto-Accept IV Quick Orders Stop Time Now Calculated Based On Rate And 
 Duration: Previously the stop time defaulted to the package/ward stop 
 date/time.
  
 - Unreleased Orders Will Not Require a DC reason: Previously these orders
 required a Discontinue reason.
  
 - Quick Outpatient Med Order Without a Route No Longer Defaults to First 
 Route on Drop-Down List: For the order to be accepted, the user must 
 explicitly enter a route.
  
 - Corrected Access Violation upon CPRS Timeout when Viewing Order Details
  
 - Message Added to Medication Order Dialog: On the Medication Order 
 dialog's Complex tab, developers added a warning message to tell users
 that if they switch from the Complex tab to the Dosage (simple) tab, they
 will lose their current data. This message dialog gives the user the
 choice of choosing OK to switch to the Dosage tab and lose the data or
 choosing Cancel to remain on the Complex tab and retain the items already
 entered.
  
 - Generic Text Quick Orders Not Displaying Under Clinic Orders: Developers
 corrected a problem with Generic Text Quick Orders not showing under
 Clinic Orders when placed from an IMO location.
  
 - Inpatient Medication Orders with PRN Cancel Due to Invalid Schedule 
 (Remedy 94417): If a user entered a medication order with PRN and then 
 cleared the schedule field by pressing the <Space Bar>, CPRS displayed an 
 error message but would allow the user to continue and receive additional 
 errors. Developers changed CPRS to not accept spaces at the beginning of a
 schedule. 
  
 - Infusion Rate Field Check Added: Developers added a check to the 
 Infusion Rate field in the IV order dialog form to validate that the value
 entered in the Infusion Rate field is in one of the following formats
 "NNNN.NN or text@labels per day"
  
 - Warning on Complex Order Tab Changed: Developers changed the warning 
 message that CPRS displays when a user attempts to switch between the 
 Complex and the Dosage tab. Developers also changed the code so that this 
 warning message only appears if something is in one of the following 
 fields: Dosage, Schedule, Duration, or Sequence.
  
 - Medication Selection List Problem Corrected (Remedy 95302, 96342):
 Developers corrected an UNDEFINED FVSUB^ORWUL error that occurred when the
 last entry in the list is selected or when a user types in first few 
 letters of the name of the drug that is the last entry on the list.
  
 - Dietetics Dialog Changed to Use ML Not CC: Developers altered the 
 Dietetics tubefeeding order dialog to use "ml" rather than "cc". Although 
 the two units reflect the same measurement, "cc" is included on JCAHO's 
 list of unapproved abbreviations.
  
 - Imaging Order Fields Incorrectly Reverting to Defaults When Changing 
 the Order: When a user edited (changed) an existing imaging order, several
 fields were reverting to the defaults when opening the dialog, rather than
 correctly populating with the contents of the order being edited. This was
 a problem because the user should not be able to change the imaging type
 although the user can change the other fields. This was an inconsistency
 between CPRS List Manager and GUI code that has been present for a very
 long time. Developers corrected this problem: the fields will now be as
 they were in the original order and all fields except the imaging type can
 be changed. 
  
 - Disable Encounter Location Changes while in Order Dialogs: Previously, a
 user could begin writing orders and with the order dialog still open, 
 select the Encounter button and change the encounter location. Because the
 order dialog did not update based on the changed location, the orders 
 could be assigned to the wrong location or might even display medications 
 that were not appropriate for that location. Developers made a change so 
 that users will not be able to access the Encounter button next to the 
 patient name while in the following order dialogs: Inpatient/Outpatient 
 medications orders, Non-VA Medications, IVM medications, Laboratory, 
 Radiology, Consults, Procedures, and Vital order dialogs. When the user 
 closes the order dialog, the user can use the Encounter button to change 
 the encounter location.
  
 - PRN Being Dropped When Changing Simple Outpatient Medication Order To 
 Complex: If a user entered a simple outpatient medication order and 
 selected PRN as part of the schedule and then changed from the Dosage tab 
 to the Complex tab, CPRS did not carry the PRN designation into the 
 complex order. Developers changed CPRS to retain the PRN in this 
 situation.
  
 - "Non-Standard" Schedules Now Appropriately Designated as "Day-of-Week"
 Schedules: Because of possible confusion due to the wording in CPRS, 
 developers changed the wording of "non-standard  schedule to 
 "Day-of-Week  schedule. The change was made on the order dialog that has 
 the Schedule Builder link. 
  
 - Schedule Builder Button To Select Everyday Added: Developers added an 
 Everyday button to the Day of Week Schedule Builder dialog. When the user 
 selects this button, all days of the week are checked.
  
 - Day-of-Week Schedule Builder Does Not Accept Free-Text: Users cannot 
 type text directly into the information box at the bottom of the 
 Day-Of-Week schedule builder. Developers changed this so that users would 
 not attempt to enter text only to have CPRS reject the schedule when it 
 attempted to validate the schedule. Users must use the checkboxes, time 
 columns, and the Add and Remove buttons to enter the appropriate day of 
 the week and the time. Developers added hover hints to the buttons.
  
 - Admin Time Only Schedule Are No Longer Allowed in CPRS (E3R 19324):
 Previously, users could enter Admin time only schedule. If the user 
 attempts this, CPRS displays a dialog stating that this is not allowed. 
 The user will not be able to accept a schedule until a day of the week is 
 selected.
  
 - Clinic Meds Display Group for IMO Orders Changed to Clinic Orders:
 Developers changed the label of the Clinic Meds display group to Clinic 
 Orders to better reflect orders written from IMO locations.
  
 - IMO Orders Can Now Be Printed in the Clinic Location: Previously, for 
 IMO orders, if a provider selected the "Clinic  Location as where a 
 medication should be administered, there was no way to print the order in 
 the clinic location. Developers changed the CPRS so that if the provider 
 selects  No  when asked "Should the orders be printed using the new 
 location?", the Orders will be printed at the Clinic. Otherwise, the 
 orders will print at the Ward.
  
 - Change to Auto-Calculation in the Dosage and Days Supply Fields (Remedy 
 107184): There was a problem when the user copied to a new order or 
 changed an order. When loading the order dialog for editing, CPRS would 
 make an initial call to calculate the days supply and quantity fields. A 
 problem could occur with a drug that did not have a possible dosage. 
 Developers made a change to prevent these fields from being calculated 
 when the dialog was loaded. If the user changes any of the fields that 
 would affect the order, such as Dosage, Schedule, or Duration, CPRS will 
 recalculate the Day Supply and/or the Quantity field each time one of 
 these fields is changed.
  
 - Changed The Conjunction Box Warning Message FROM:
   A duration is required when using "Then" as a conjunction.
   TO:
   A duration is required when using "Then" as a conjunction. The patient 
   will be instructed to take these doses consecutively, not concurrently.
  
 - Order-Level Locking Corrected (Remedy 113212): On the Meds tab, CPRS was
 not performing an order-level lock check when changing an order. Without
 the lock, it was possible for a user to change a pending order at the same
 time a pharmacist was finishing the order. Developers corrected this
 problem.
  
 - Radiology Order Dialog Displaying Inactive Radiologists: CPRS was 
 displaying inactive radiologists in the Approving Radiologists list. 
 Developers changed CPRS to filter the approving radiologist list by 
 inactive date.
  
 - IV Order Spelling Correction: Developers changed the misspelled word 
 "Strenth" to "Strength".
  
 - TIU Objects May be Used in Generic Text Orders (Remedy 123303, E3R 
 18901): The text should wrap correctly in the ORDER TEXT field in the 
 detailed display of these text orders.
  
 - Dosage Not Correctly Interpreted when Finishing Order from a Quick 
 Order (Remedy 87476): When placing a quick order for a complex inpatient 
 medication order, the incorrect Unit Dose for the medication was appearing
 in the Pharmacy screen when the Pharmacist was completing the order. This
 has been fixed.
  
 - PRN Quick Orders Not Working (Remedy 94396): Inpatient and outpatient 
 quick orders with schedules such as Q4H-PRN were not working properly, 
 causing the clinician to reselect the schedule from the drop-down list. 
 The dialogs were displaying Q4H- in the schedule field and the PRN box is 
 checked. If the clinician clicks on Accept the following message is 
 presented: "This order cannot be saved for the following reason(s): Unable
 to resolve non-standard schedule". Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Service Connection Prompt Not Being Answered in CPRS (Remedy 129246):
 The problem was the inconsistent appearance of a service connection (SC) 
 prompt in CPRS and the pharmacy package. The problem occurred when a 
 signed medication order was changed, causing the SC to be dropped from 
 signature form. This was resolved by changing the code to call the new 
 CoPay RPC, which is the same RPC being used by CIDC.
  
 -- Order Checks
  
 - User Can Now Press <Enter> After Entering a Reason for Overriding an 
 Order Check: If a user got an order check, decided to override the order 
 check, and entered a reason for override, the user was required to click 
 the Submit button or tab to the Submit button and press <Enter>. 
 Developers have made a change the enables the user to press <Enter> 
 immediately after typing the reason, and the <Enter> will by default be 
 the same as using the Submit button. 
  
 -- Orders Delayed
  
 - Treating Specialty Selection Error Corrected (Remedy 95330): If a user 
 edited a delayed order that contained the prompt OR GTX TREATING 
 SPECIALTY, and if the release event involved had specific treating 
 specialties assigned, then if a user typed in the treating specialty combo
 box, CPRS would clear the selection list, leaving it empty. The user then
 could not select a treating specialty. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Delayed Diet Orders Incorrectly Prompting for Late Tray (Remedy 93955):
 For delayed release diet orders, because the start date is unknown at the
 time of ordering, CPRS should never prompt the user for a late tray.
 Developers corrected this problem.
  
 -- Order Signature
  
 - Access Violation When Signing Orders: When the user either selected 
 orders and then the Action/Sign menu, or when the user caused the 
 Review/Sign changes screen to appear, an access violation frequently 
 occurred. Developers corrected the problem. 
  
 - Some Discontinued Orders Now Require a Signature: Following direction
 from the CPRS Clinical Workgroup and to help resolve PSI-04-063,
 developers changed CPRS to require a signature for orders that have been
 discontinued in CPRS. All discontinued orders that require a reason for
 discontinuing will now require a signature.
  
 -- Order Signature (Digital)/PKI
  
 CPRS Inappropriately Requiring Digital Signature Card (Remedy 70928): If 
 clinicians were using the PKI digital signature feature, CPRS was 
 requiring them to insert their card when the order was not being signed, 
 such as when a note but not the order was being signed, when closing CPRS 
 and choosing "Don't Sign", and when changing a patient and choosing "Don't
 Sign". Developers have corrected this problem.
  
 -- Parameters 
  
 - Incorrect Parameter Description (Remedy 69506): Previously, the 
 parameter description referenced the wrong parameter for individual time 
 and occurrence settings. In the last part of the description ORWRP 
 TIME/OCC LIMITS ALL has been changed to ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV. 
  
 - Parameter to Control Remote Data Views Access to the HDR: CPRS 
 developers created a new parameter ORWRP HDR ON that controls whether a 
 site will query the HDR for remote data. This parameter will be OFF when 
 exported, so that sites will not be querying the HDR. 
  
 WARNING: Sites should not enable this parameter until they receive
 official instructions. There is the possibility that inaccurate or
 misaligned data could be displayed in CPRS.
  
 -- Patient Information Bar 
  
 Problems with Sizing, Scroll Bars, and Difficult Navigation to 
 Information: If the size of the CPRS window was changed, there were some 
 concerns that not all information from the buttons on the Patient 
 Information bar would be visible or easily found. One method of addressing
 this problem was to add items to the View Menu. The View menu now has a
 submenu, "Information  that contains actions to all buttons (Patient
 Inquiry, Flag, Reminder, etc.) on the Patient Information bar. When the
 width of the CPRS form is small or font size large, some buttons may be
 overlaid and not accessible, users can use this menu to access any button.
  
 -- Patient Inquiry (Demographics)
  
 - Patient Inquiry Button Information Slowly Disappears (Remedy 70321):
 CPRS users would occasionally experience a problem with the patient name 
 and social security number (SSN) disappearing from the Patient Inquiry 
 button. This has been corrected.
  
 - New API Call for Insurance Information in Demographics: Because an 
 existing API call that returns patient insurance information for display 
 will soon be retired, developers added a new call to return this same 
 information in the patient demographics screen. Users should not notice a 
 difference in the information returned.
  
 -- Problems Tab
  
 Problems Tab Message Clarified: If a user were adding or editing a problem
 on the Problems tab, navigated to another tab in the chart, and then
 attempted to close CPRS, CPRS displays a message asking the user to 
 confirm "Discard Changes (yes/no)". However, the message did not indicate 
 that it related to the problem being entered or edited. Developers 
 clarified the message box to direct the user to the Problems tab.
  
 -- Reminders
  
 - Date/Time for Vitals Entry through Reminders Changed (Remedy 70610):
 Developers changed the Reminder dialog to use the Default Date/Time of NOW
 instead of the encounter date/time when entering vitals through a reminder
 dialog. 
  
 - Prompt Changed for Skin Reading (Remedy 70631): Previously, the number 
 selector for Skin Reading had values from zero to ten. However, clinicians
 had different interpretation of what zero meant than developers did.
 Developers changed the Reminder dialog's Skin Reading prompt to a combo 
 box to allow for a null value meaning that the test had not been read and 
 a zero meaning the test had been read and it was negative. The correct 
 value can then be stored in the note. 
  
 - Reminder Dialog Branching Logic Not Working When Editing a Dialog That 
 Is Already on the Coversheet and/or If The Dialog Is in the Other 
 Categories Folder 
  
 Note: For information on branching logic, see the Clinical Reminder 
 Manager's Manual on the VistA Documentation Library (VDL). 
 Developers corrected two problems with the branching logic:
  
   - The branching logic was not working when adding branching logic to a 
     dialog that is already defined on the coversheet and CPRS is open. 
     The branching logic would not work unless the reminder is removed from
     the coversheet or CPRS is restarted. 
   - Branching logic was not working for Reminder Dialogs that are defined
     only in the Other Categories folders. 
  
 Developers changed the M dialog loader code so that it passes the
 patient-specific flag when the dialog is loaded into CPRS. This change
 associates the patient-specific flag with the dialog itself and not the
 reminder. This fix also resolves the problem with dialogs in the Other
 Categories folder not working with branching logic. If adding branching
 logic to a dialog that is already on the coversheet and CPRS is open, the
 Refresh Reminder Dialog button will cause CPRS to reload the dialog and
 the patient-specific flag will be passed up at that time.
  
 - Disappearing Splitter Bar Corrected (Remedy 69801): If a user expanded 
 the text box over the buttons on the Reminder dialog with the splitter bar
 and left it that way, the splitter bar became inaccessible and the user
 could not get back to the buttons. This has been corrected and the 
 splitter bar now remains accessible.
  
 - Hospital Location Error (Remedy 71112): Users were receiving an 
 "ERROR:HOSPITAL LOCATION Missing is not in file 44 Value:0" error. This 
 error occurs when the following steps are taken: 
  
 1. Start a new note. 
 2. Enter a vital through a reminder dialog and finish the dialog. 
 3. Save the note without signature. 
 4. Sign-out and sign back into CPRS. 
 5. Do not select a location. 
 6. Edited the previous note. 
 7. Re-enter vital data through a reminder dialog and finish the dialog.
  
 The error will occur here because the vital entry does not have a location
 to say where the vital was taken. 
 The fix for this problem is to default the Hospital locations to the
 location of the note if a location is not selected for the user.
  
 - Support for Future Mental Health Patch: Developers added code to handle
 the new Mental Health test format that will be released with YS*5.01*85.
 The changes makes CPRS backward-compatible - able to handle both formats.
  
 -- Remote Data Views
  
 Remote Data View Site Tabs Changed to Buttons to Visually Distinguish 
 Which Tab Is Selected: When using Remote Data Views (RDV), the user might
 find it difficult to determine which tab was selected. To address this
 issue, developers changed the tabs to buttons so that it is easier to
 distinguish which site's data the user is viewing.
  
 -- Reports/Health Summary
  
 - Inappropriate Text Displaying on Health Summary Ad Hoc Subdialog: If the
 user were creating an Ad Hoc Health Summary, one of the subitem menus from
 which the user would select had some inappropriate characters (letters)
 displaying by the up and down arrow buttons. Developers corrected this.
  
 - Additional Vitals Measurements Added to CPRS Reports: Developers 
 modified Vitals Reports on the Reports tab to include pain, central venous
 pressure (CVP), Pulse Oximetry (P Ox%), and Circumference/ Girth (C/G).
  
 - Changes Related to the Health Data Repository (HDR): A number of changes
 have been implemented to support HDR. HDR reports will not be available
 until the HDR is online. It is being noted here so that sites are aware
 that there have been changes added in support of HDR. These changes should
 not have any impact on the Reports Tab. The following components are being
 added with this version:
  
  - Routine: ORWRP4 (new) ORWRP3, ORDV04 (changed)
  - RPC: ORWRP4 HDR MODIFY 
  - Fields added to the OE/RR REPORT file (# 101.24):
    - .45 HDR REPORT 
    - .46 HDR ROUTINE 
    - .47 HDR ENTRY POINT 
    - 1 (under Columns multiple) HDR MODIFIER
  
 -- Section 508, Resizing, and Font Issues
  
 - Resizing Issue Corrected (Remedy 70573): Developers increased the size 
 of IV Fluid Order dialog to prevent the Additives tab from overlapping the
 additives text field.
  
 - IV Fluid Order Dialog Missing Text: On the IV Fluid Order dialog at the
 top of the upper left panel, there is a blank field of normal size before
 the additives are inserted. After the additives are inserted, this field
 is reduced in size so that the top half of the text is missing making it
 very difficult to read. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Focus Problem Involving Multiple Dialogs Fixed: If a user had a child 
 window open and switched focus to the window behind it, the user could not
 get the focus back to the original child window using a keystroke. Now
 ALT+F1 puts the focus back to the topmost child window.
  
 - Dialog Size Retention: If a user changes the size of the following 
 dialogs and closes the dialog, CPRS stores the size and displays the 
 dialog at the same size the next time it is opened.
  
   - Problems Details dialog on the Cover Sheet
   - Medication Details dialog on the Meds tab
   - Select Lab Test by Date dialog on the Labs tab
   - Discharge Summaries Properties Dialog on the D/C Summ tab
   - Encounter Form (Remedy 70365)
   - Consult order dialog
   - Procedure order dialog
  
 - Button Problem and Size Retention Corrected: Developers corrected 
 problems with the display of buttons at different font sizes for the 
 following dialogs:
  
   - 'Print Setup' Dialog (Remedy 70367): The OK and Cancel buttons now 
     display properly in font sizes greater than 8. The size of the dialog 
     is saved from session to session.
   - Template Dialog (Remedy 70233): When a user selects a font preference
     larger than 8, templates no longer pull up with the Preview, OK and
     Cancel buttons on top of each other. Also, when the template is 
     resized, the size is saved.
   - Duplicate Order Checks Dialog (Remedy 70541): The Continue and Cancel
     Selected Orders buttons will no longer be chopped off with any font
     greater than 8 pt. Now this Dialog will also save its size, from use 
     to use.
   - Details Dialog: Developers adjusted the Details window properties so 
     that the Print and Close buttons can be accessed at all font sizes. 
     The following were affected: Active Problems, Active Meds, Recent
     Labs, Appointment/Visits/Admissions when a note is opened,
     Crisis/Warning notes/directives, problem on Problem tab, Med on Meds
     tab, order on Orders tab.
   - Renew Orders Dialog Display Issues: If a user changed fonts, some 
     display problems could occur, such as column headers not displaying 
     correctly, one pane displaying too large, buttons not displaying, or 
     information being off the dialog and no scroll bars appearing so that 
     the user could get to the information. The issues have been corrected.
   - Current Activities Dialog: Developers made changes so that this dialog
     worked with large fonts, such as 24 points.
   - New Procedure and New Consult Dialog: Developers made changes to 
     ensure that these dialogs worked correctly at all available font 
     sizes.
   - Consults Text "Hiding behind the Treeview Button": Developers 
     corrected this problem.
   - Button Display Problem on Location for Current Activities Window: When
     the user opened the Location for Current Activities window, the OK and
     Cancel buttons were not always visible. The user could not resize the 
     window to make CPRS display the buttons nor did changing the font size
     help. 
   - Height of Templates Drawer Not Saved on Surgery Tab: Developers 
     corrected this problem. CPRS now saves the height of the Surgery tab's
     Templates drawer between sessions.
   - Non-Formulary Options Dialog Buttons and Size Retention Problems 
     Resolved: The buttons on this dialog are now visible at larger font 
     sizes. The form also remembers its size. The position will be 
     centered on CPRS main form.
  
 - Meds Pane Resizing Could Cause Problems: It was possible for the user to
 resize the panes on the Meds tab and make it difficult to then resize them
 again. Developers fixed this problem.
  
 - Meds Tab Columns Can Be Dragged Off the Screen: Users could reposition 
 the columns on the Meds tab off the screen, confusing users who might not 
 see the expected columns. Developers added code for all three headers so 
 that users cannot drag them out of sight, off the display area.
  
 - Order Procedure Dialog 508 Problem Corrected: When displayed in size 10
 fonts, CPRS no longer truncates the word "Inpatient" under the "patient
 will be seen as:" group box of the New Procedure dialog.
  
 - Patient Selection List Repeated Names: If a user scrolled down to the 
 bottom of some selection lists, patient or clinic names might be repeated 
 at the bottom of the list. Developers corrected this problem.
  
 - Non-VA Meds Column Resizing Problem Corrected: If users resized the 
 Non-VA Medications pane on the Meds Tab, the column headers resized 
 correctly, but the same columns in the medication rows do not resize 
 appropriately; they remained where they were. Developers corrected this 
 problem.
  
 - Provider and Location Box for Current Activities: The provider list will
 now default to a larger display and will also enlarge as the form is 
 enlarged.
  
 - Reason for Request Field Hidden at Higher Font Sizes: The Reason for 
 Request field on the Consults dialog is now visible at higher font sizes. 
 Please note that if all the components cannot fit on the dialog because of
 its size, CPRS will display vertical and horizontal scroll bars.
  
 - Insufficient Room on the Outpatient Medication Renewal Form: Previously,
 the bottom line of refills/pickup was cut off; there was not enough room
 for the complete order. If the user adjusted the size of the dialog, CPRS
 did not store the new size between sessions. CPRS now stores the size.
  
 - Sizing Problems with the Orders, Meds, Problems Tabs Tables: The tables
 (or grids) on these tabs have a feature to keep columns visible. When
 expanded, they "snap" back to their width when the length of the title bar
 exceeds the tables  width. When changing fonts or widening the form width
 of CPRS, it is possible to have the title bar exceeding its intended
 length making it difficult to resize the columns. Developers added a
 change to CPRS so that users can always make the width of the column
 smaller, regardless of the title bar length. You can also click any of the
 title bar buttons (or column headers) to "autosize" the field widths to an
 optimal width, which makes all of the columns fit in the window. The
 autosize also occurs when changing fonts. This avoids the need for
 horizontal scrolling of the table.
  
 - Outpatient Meds Dialog Size Too Small: Previously, for the renewal of 
 outpatient medications, the outpatient medications dialog box initially 
 opened too small. Developer corrected this problem. The dialog will 
 initially open larger.
  
 - Renew Medication Order Text Cut Off: The Renew medication order text 
 displayed on the button and the header were being cut off. Developers 
 added a change so that the buttons and header will no longer shrink below 
 a minimum size.
  
 - Resolved "Cannot focus...  then "List out of bounds" Errors: This 
 correction affects both inpatient and outpatient medication order dialogs.
 If a new order is placed, and then the provider decides to make a change
 in the route, and uses the <Enter> key to accept the order, the following
 error displays: Cannot focus a disabled window or invisible window. After
 closing the error, the change of the route is entered, but when the
 provider tries to sign the order, sometimes a "List out of bounds" error
 displays. The "Cannot focus" error was also occurring on orders without a
 route or dosage.

 Problem with CPRS "Hanging" if User Does Not Have the CPRS GUI Chart 
 Option (Remedy 70567): If a user did not have access to the option OR CPRS
 GUI CHART, CPRS displayed an error message saying "Application context
 could not be created!" when the user tried to launch CPRS. When the user
 clicked OK, CPRS would hang instead of closing. This has been corrected.

   ORDER file (#100):
      The Signature Status field #4 of the Order Actions multiple (sub-file
      #100.008) in the ORDER file (# 100) has been modified to add this
      new signature type: '8' FOR ON PARENT order

   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The "JAWS_Scripts_215.ZIP" file contains configuration files that
 replace the file in "informational" patch OR*3.0*126.  These configuration
 files will need to be copied to the <JAWS>\SETTINGS\ENU\ file on all
 workstations using JAWS.  JAWS power users will likely want to install 
 and customize these files themselves. 
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:

 INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES:
 ================================
  
 -- Required Patches:
  
 Before you can install the CPRS v.26 file OR_30_215.KID, which contains 
 patch OR*3.0*215, you must install the following required patches:
  
 DG*5.3*554 
 GMRV*5.0*3 
 IB*2.0*267 
 IB*2.0*317    
 OR*3.0*198 
 OR*3.0*220 
 OR*3.0*229 
 OR*3.0*235 
 OR*3.0*239 
 OR*3.0*241 
 PSJ*5.0*112 
 PSJ*5.0*127 
 PSS*1.0*93 
 PXRM*1.5*12 
 SD*5.3*285 
 SD*5.3*316 
 TIU*1.0*175 
 TIU*1.0*202 
  
 -- Related Patches: 
  
 The following patches are required for functionality but are not required 
 for installation.
  
 FH*5.5*1
 FH*5.5*2
 GMTS*2.7*78
 OSLC*337*2
 PSO*7.0*210
 TIU*1.0*186
 XU*8.0*265
 XU*8.0*337
 XU*8.0*361
 XU*8.0*395
  
 -- Internet Explorer:
  
 NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE4) or later is REQUIRED in order for 
 GUI version 26 to run.  However IE 5.5 or later with 128-bit 
 encryption is required for PKI functionality. 
  
 -- CPRSUpdate:
  
 - Range Check Errors: This is identified as Known Issue # 4 described in 
 the "Known Issues" section. There is a defect in CPRSUpdate (released with
 OR*3.0*10) which results in range check errors to occur on workstations
 that have not been rebooted in 24.85 days or more. To prevent the errors
 from occurring, perform a PC reboot of all PCs prior to the GOLD server 
 copy of the CPRS executable being put in place.
  
 - Unzipping Files and Date/Time Issues: Some ZIP extraction utilities may
 produce extracted files with the current date/time instead of the files  
 original date/times. Before extracting the files, note the file date/times
 inside the ZIP for CPRSChart.EXE, the help files, and BORLNDMM.DLL. Move
 these files to the appropriate directory where they can be accessed by all
 CPRS workstations. After moving the files, compare the file date/times of
 the extracted copies to those contained in the ZIP. They should be the
 same. If this is not the case, the CPRSUpdate application may not function
 correctly.
  
 -- Environment Check:
  
 During internal testing of CPRS GUI v26 and the New Term Rapid Turnaround 
 (NTRT) update of allergy terms a problem was identified. During the NTRT
 updates when a term's new definition is propagated down through the
 existing allergies, the patient's orders are checked to see if there is
 any interaction between the drug ordered and the allergy information.
 During that check, a routine from CPRS is invoked to obtain the patient's 
 current orders. That routine is also included in OR*3.0*215. 
 As a result, if the NTRT update is running and the site installs
 OR*3.0*215 it's possible to get an error that will cause the NTRT updating
 to stop. As a result, developers added an environment check to the
 OR*3.0*215 install that will check if an NTRT update is active. If it is,
 the user is given a warning message and the installation stops. 
  
 Note: Please ensure that the environment check passes before distributing
 the OR*3.0*215 CPRS executable.
  
 -- Installation Compliance Date:
  
 The compliance date for installation of OR*3*215 is 45 days. The extended 
 date is due, in part, to NTRT updates that are scheduled for Thursdays. It
 is possible that the NTRT updates could extend into Friday. Sites should
 NOT schedule the installation of OR*3*215 if an Allergies NTRT update is
 scheduled. These updates are announced via an ANR NTRT Update Information
 bulletin distributed via Outlook. The bulletin includes the date/time of
 the update as well as the entities included in the update. 
 The following patches have also extended their compliance dates to 45 days
 due to their interrelationship with OR*3*215: GMRV*5*3, TIU*1*202,
 SD*5.3*285, TIU*1*184, GMTS*2.7*78, PSS*1*93, PSO*7*214, DG*5.3*554,
 USR*1*27.
  
 -- Additional Required DLL:
  
 In order to execute, CPRS GUI v26 requires that an additional Dynamic Link
 Library (DLL) be accessible in the workstation's search path. The DLL
 (borlndmm.dll) was exported in advance with CPRS v25 (OR*3*195) to ensure
 that it is in place BEFORE V26 IS INSTALLED. In v25, the existing
 autoupdate functionality was enhanced so that borlndmm.dll would be copied
 to the workstation from the GOLD server directory at the same time that
 the CPRSChart.exe and HLP files were updated. If you use the autoupdate
 functionality, this update would/will occur when automatically updating
 from any earlier CPRS version to v25 or higher. The update can be
 confirmed by the presence of borlndmm.dll in the path defined in the
 workstation's PATH variable, or in the same directory as CPRSChart.exe
 after the autoupdate. 
 If borlndmm.dll is placed in the GOLD directory after v26 is installed,
 the autoupdate will NOT include the borlndmm.dll and CPRS GUI v26 will not
 execute. In this case, sites must use SMS continuous push to install the
 borlndmm.dll on all workstations. 
 This DLL manages memory when CPRS accesses external Dynamic Link Libraries
 such as _VitalsViewEnter.dll.
  
 -- OE/RR PRINT FIELDS file (# 100.22) and the OE/RR PRINT FORMATS file (# 
 100.23)
  
 This patch will replace certain entries with internal numbers greater than
 1000 in the OE/RR PRINT FIELDS file (# 100.22) and the OE/RR PRINT 
 FORMATS file (# 100.23). Listed below are the entries being exported from
 these files. If you have modified any of these entries, or have anything
 different from these entries, please note that they will be over-written
 when this patch is installed.  Please refer to Chapters 10 and 11 of the
 CPRS Setup Guide for instructions on how to add and move entries in these
 files.  The rules and instructions for editing entries in these files are
 in Chapter III.B.10.  The instructions for editing parameters associated
 with these files are in Chapter III.B.11. The current Web address for the
 CPRS Setup Guide is:

 -- OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24):
  
 Items in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) with entry numbers greater than
 999 are reserved, and should not be used for local enhancements.  If you
 have any local changes to items in this number range that you want to
 keep, move them to an internal number <999.  This patch will delete these
 entries numbers before proceeding with the install.
  
  Changes to entries in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24)
  are as follows:
  
   NUMBER: 1550                            NAME: ORRPW HDR
     ID: OR_HDR_IMS                        TAB: REPORTS TAB
     TYPE: MENU                            HEADING: HDR Reports
     DESCRIPTIVE TEXT: HDR Reports
   ITEM: ORRPW HDR ALLERGIES
   ITEM: ORRPW HDR VITALS
   ITEM: ORRPW HDR PHARMACY OUT
  
 This item is being exported in anticipation of the release and
 availability of the HDR.  A future patch will be released when the HDR
 becomes available, which will enable these reports.  Until then, do not
 add these items to anyone's menu of available reports.
  
 -- Determine Coordinator of Mail group
  
 As you will be prompted for this during the install, determine the
 coordinator of the OR DRUG ORDER CANCELLED Mail group.
  
 -- Local Order Dialogs
  
 If your site has created any local order dialogs from national order 
 dialogs the installer of this patch will receive a bulletin mail message
 informing them of local order dialogs that may need to be reviewed and 
 updated since this patch modifies nationally exported order dialogs.

     parameter OR ALLERGY ENTERED IN ERROR at the appropriate level (USER, 
     CLASS, DIVISION, or SYSTEM). 
  
     Note: If you are going to use the CLASS level setting, please read
     Known Issue # 3 "Problem OR ALLERGY ENTERED IN ERROR Parameter
     Inheritance": Then, do one of the following:
     
     1. To allow ALL users in a selected user class including all of its
     subclasses to mark allergies as entered in error, set the OR ALLERGY 
     ENTERED IN ERROR parameter to YES for the highest level of the user 
     class,
     
     2. Or to control which subclasses of a user class can mark allergies
     as entered in error based on the subclass, DO NOT set the OR ALLERGY 
     ENTERED IN ERROR parameter for the highest level of the selected user 
     class, but DO then set the OR ALLERGY ENTERED IN ERROR parameter for 
     each individual subclass of the selected user class.
