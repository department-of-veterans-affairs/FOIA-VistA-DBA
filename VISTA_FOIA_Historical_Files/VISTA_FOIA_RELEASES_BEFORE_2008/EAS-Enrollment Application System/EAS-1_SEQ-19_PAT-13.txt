 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 On January 23, 2002, President Bush signed Public Law 107-135, The 
 Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 
 2001.  Section 202 of this Act requires the implementation of HUD indices 
 to determine geographic income thresholds in support of more discrete 
 means testing.  Veterans in Priority Group 7 are eligible for treatment 
 as a low-income family under section 3(b) of the United States Housing 
 Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)) for the area in which such veterans 
 reside, regardless of whether such veterans are treated as single person 
 families under paragraph (3)(A) of such section 3(b) or as families under 
 paragraph (3)(b).  This Act also established   Priority Group 8 for any 
 veterans described in section 1710(a)(3) of titles 38 U.S.C. who are not 
 covered by Priority Group 7.
  
 The Geographic Means Testing project introduces enhancements to the VistA 
 and HEC Legacy systems to support the requirements of the new 
 regulation.  These enhancements consist of the following:
  
 1. The storage of the HUD indices and utilization of the HUD indices to 
 determine the GMT Threshold based on the veteran's address.
  
 2. Zip code linking so that the entry of the zip code in the veteran's 
 address automatically populates the city, state and county fields. 
  
 3. The creation of a new means test status, GMT Copay Required, and the 
 calculations needed to assign this new status based on the GMT Threshold.
  
 4. The means test status, Category A, has been changed to MT Copay 
 Exempt, and the means test status, Category C, has been changed to MT 
 Copay Required.
  
 5. The creation of the new Priority Group 8 and the modifications to the 
 logic for determining a veteran's enrollment priority.  The changes 
 include the new rules for assigning Priority Group 7 and 8.
  
 6. Modifications to HL7 messages to accommodate the transmission of new 
 data fields between the VAMCs and the HEC.
  
 For a detailed description of the functionality included in this project, 
 please refer to the Geographic Means Testing and Address Indexing for GMT 
 Software Requirements Specification documents.  These documents can be 
 found on the web page for the Geographic Means Testing Project Notebook.  
 The address is: 
 http://tspr.vista.med.va.gov/warboard/anotebk.asp?proj=625&Type=Active
  
 The enhancements are being distributed in several patches that will be 
 installed in four phases as outlined below:

 The software for this patch, EAS*1*13, and associated patches, are not 
 being distributed through the National Patch Module.  These patches are 
 being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file).  
 This patch contains the informational portion of EAS*1*13 and provides 
 field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install, and 
 implement the patch software.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
  
 1. The addition of two new files, the GMT Thresholds file (#712.5) and 
 the GMT MSA Code file (#712.6).  These files contain the information used 
 to determine the GMT Threshold based on the veteran's address.
  
 2. The addition of a new menu option, GMT Thresholds Lookup by Zip Code 
 [EAS GMT THRESHOLDS LOOKUP].  This option will prompt the user to enter a 
 zip code and then display the GMT Threshold values for that zip code.  
 The new option will be added to the Means Test Users Menu.
  
 3. The addition of a new menu option, View Patient Address [EAS VIEW 
 PATIENT ADDRESS].  This option will prompt the user to enter a patient 
 SSN and then display address information for that patient.  The new menu 
 option will be added to the Registration Menu.
   
 4. Modifications to the following three reports to include the new means 
 test status, GMT Copay Required, and to change the display of means test 
 status Category A to MT Copay Exempt and Category C to MT Copay Required:
  
         Means Test Daily Expiration Report
         Means Test Signature Details Report
         Means Test Signature Summary Report
  
 5. Modifications to the text of 60-Day, 30-Day and 0-Day means test 
 countdown letters to make them applicable to veterans who are either MT 
 Copay Exempt or GMT Copay Required.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
  
         * * * * * *  A  T  T  E  N  T  I  O  N  * * * * * * 
   
 It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business 
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
 Installation will take approximately 20 minutes.
  
 This patch should NOT be installed while the IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM 
 BACKGROUND JOB] is running.
  
 In order to prevent missing HL7 traffic while this patch is being 
 installed, TaskMan should be placed in a wait state.
  
 This software distribution requires the following patches be     
 installed:
   
      DG*5.3*454
      IVM*2*58
      IB*2*188
  
   Installation Steps:
   ==================
   
   1. Download the KIDS file EAS_1_P13.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
      directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the
      appropriate directory on your system.
   
   2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION 
      menu, and enter:  EAS_1_P13.KID
   
   3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1*13, DG*5.3*456, IVM*2*62,
      IB*2*183, or PRCA*4.5*181 are mapped, they should be removed from 
      the mapped set at this time.
   
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select 
      the Installation menu.
   
   5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*13).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
         
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*13.
   
   7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is
      recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
      rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
   
   8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
   9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        
          IVM BACKGROUND JOB               
   
  10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
  
  11. Return TaskMan to it's normal state.
