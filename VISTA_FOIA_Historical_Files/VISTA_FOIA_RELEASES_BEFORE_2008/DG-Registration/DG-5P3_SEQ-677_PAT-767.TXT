Subject: FIX OF DGENRPD2 (GETPAT)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
 This patch corrects two problems:
 1.      A problem was found when using the option 'Upcoming Appointments
         without Enrollment' [DGEN APPTS,NOT ENROLLED]. When listing the
         future appointments for patients on the first of any month, an
         INVALID INPUT ARRAY ENTRY error gets displayed on the screen
         This is due to the beginning date being set to a date greater than
         the ending date.  The Scheduling API does not recognize this as
         a valid date range and sends an error message to the screen.  
  
 2.      The second issue with this report is that the end date has a 
         timestamp of 10:00 and does not allow any appointments to
         list if the timestamp is greater than 10:00.
  
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
  
 The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service Requests
 associated with this patch.
  
 1. Associated Remedy Tickets:
    -----------------------------------------
 HD0000000188488 Error: Invalid input array entry
    
 2. Associated New Service Request(s):
    -----------------------------------------
    NONE 
  
 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 This patch corrects the following problems:
  
 1.   When listing the future appointments for patients on the first of any
      month, an  INVALID INPUT ARRAY ENTRY error displays on the
      screen for the Upcoming Appointments without Enrollment report.
      The beginning date gets set to a date greater than the ending date.
      The Scheduling API does not recognize this as a valid date range
      and sets and error message to the screen.  
      
  
    Solution: Fix the time on the beginning and ending dates to include 
              the entire beginning and ending date.
  
 2.   When using the Upcoming Appointments without Enrollment option,
      the report will not display any future appointments that have a
      timestamp after 10:00 due to the end date time being set to 10:00.
     
    Solution: Set the time for the end date to always be .2359.

 V. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
  * Environment Check:
  
     Programmer access is required for installing this patch.  Prior to 
     installation, the installer must ensure the DUZ(0) node of the DUZ
     array is set to the "@" symbol.
  
  * Users On the System: 
  
     This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
     loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
     reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
  * Software Installation Time:
  
     The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off peak
     hours.

         backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
