General Information


Before you attempt to install this version of AMIE, please be sure that your site is running the following minimum package versions.

VA FileMan V. 20.0
Kernel V. 7.1
MailMan V. 7.1
Kernel Tool Kit V. 7.2
Lab V. 5.0
PIMS V. 5.3
HINQ V. 4.0



Installation Steps


Step    Description

1.      Resource Requirements

2.4k per 2507 exam
.65k per 7131 request

Global Growth of Existing Files

2507 REQUEST file (#396.3) growth will be negligible.
FORM 7131 file (#396) may average growth of .5k per record if your site is multidivisional and transfers four reports per request to different divisions.
2507 EXAM file (#396.4) will grow by .1k for each exam included on priority insufficient 2507 requests.

Global Growth from New Files

.2k per AMIE C&P Exam Tracking Record
The 2507 INSUFFICIENT REASONS file (# 396.94) will require 2.6k and will not grow.

There is only a minor demand on space that will be taken up as a result of the post-init process.  No more than 10k will be used for new keywords and other data.

Usage of space may increase depending on the purge parameter, Days to
Keep 2507 History.  See the technical manual for further details.

The install on an ALPHA site takes approximately 10 minutes, with the post-init taking another 5-10 minutes.  The loading of the global tape for an ALPHA takes about 20-30 minutes.

The install on a MSM site takes approximately 10-15 minutes.  The loading of the global tape for a MSM takes about 20 minutes.


2.      Data is being changed and added in both the AMIE files and KERNEL (MTLU) files.  It is important to do a system backup before installing.

Step    Description

3.      The init can be run with users on the system, but this would have a negative impact on system performance.  It is recommended that this init be run after hours.  All AMIE users must be off the system(s).  This includes users from other VA medical centers and regional offices.  


4.      Set the following options to OUT OF ORDER.

Options
DVBA MEDICAL ADM 7131 MENU
DVBA REGIONAL OFFICE MENU
DVBA C PROCESS MAIL MESSAGE
DVBA C PHYSICIANS GUIDE

These options will be brought in by the init in an OUT OF ORDER status.

Any 2507 exam requests transferred in while the DVBA C PROCESS MAIL MESSAGE option is OUT OF ORDER will not be processed and will need to be retransferred from the remote site.


5.      Sign into the UCI where the package is to be loaded.


6.      Review queued jobs to avoid possible delays or conflicts.  If there are any AMIE jobs queued, requeue them for later.  Ensure that there are no AMIE users on the system.


7.      Delete all the AMIE DVBA* and DVBC* routines.  This is to clean up all the unnecessary routines.


8.      Load AMIE V. 2.7 routines.


9.      Run the integ routine as follows:  D ^DVBANTEG

Step    Description

10.     In order to set up all environment variables, run the following.  Insure that 
        your DUZ(0) equals "@" in order to initialize.  Do not enter VA FileMan after ^XUP.

>K

>D ^XUP

Setting up programmer environment
Access Code:

Select OPTION NAME:

11.     D ^DVBAINIT
        Be sure to answer the questions carefully.  See the sample installation for DVBAINIT responses.  After running the init, a mail message will be sent to both the DUZ of the person who ran the init and to the Postmaster.  This message will notify the site of any problems during the init.  A description of the possible errors that may be reported is contained in Attachment A to this Installation Guide.


12.     Delete the init routines DVBAI*, DVBAON*, DVBAO0*.


13.     Move DVBA* and DVBC* routines to all systems.


14.     Before loading the new global containing the Physician's Guide, it is recommended you delete the data in the AMIE DOCUMENT file ^DVBP(396.91) and AMIE DOCUMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS file ^DVBP(396.92).  D ^XUP followed by the entry point:  DELETE ^DVBAPOPU.

Step    Description

15.     Load AMIE global.
        Use the appropriate vendor supplied utility to restore the global from distributed media (4mm data tape or TK-85 tape).  This will load the AMIE DOCUMENT file ^DVBP(396.91) and AMIE DOCUMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS file ^DVBP(396.92).  The following table describes the possible distribution sets for the AMIE global.

4mm Data Tape           1Tape   ASU     8192bpi for MSM sites.  Single tape contains two
                                                                new files in one new global.
TK-85 Tape              1Tape   VAL5    2048bpi for Alpha sites.  Single tape contains two
                                                                new files in one new global.

16.     If applicable, reenable journaling and routine mapping.


17.     Check to make sure that all of the following options are queued through TaskMan.  (Refer to the Implementation and Maintenance section of the Technical Manual, if necessary.)
        
        DVBA REGIONAL TASK
        DVBA AUTO FINALIZE 7131 TASK
        DVBA 7132 TASKMAN
        DVBA C PRINT NEW C&P REQ TM
        DVBA GENERATE 21-DAY CERTIF
        DVBA C PURGE 2507
        DVBA REGIONAL PURGING PROGRAM
        DVBA C CHECK 2507 INTEGRITY TM

Step    Description

18.     Remove OUT OF ORDER message from the options and protocol by running the following code.

>D OPEN^DVBAPOST

DVBA MEDICAL ADM 7131 MENU Now in order!
DVBA REGIONAL OFFICE MENU Now in order!
DVBA C PROCESS MAIL MESSAGE Now in order!
DVBA C PHYSICIANS GUIDE Now in order!
DVBA C&P SCHD EVENT Now in order!


19.     The DVBA 7131 Non-Admitted Vets option on the DVBA REGIONAL OFFICE MENU is now obsolete.  This option has been taken off of the AMIE menus.  The site is able to remove it from any secondary menus and then delete it.

{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Diagnose and rectify the cause of the error based on the error message that displays on the abort.
{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Restart the initialization process as follows.
From programmer mode, load the error log into a mail message and send it with the following command:  >D MAIL^DVBAPOST

If this error occurs again, proceed as follows.

{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Use the Global Lister to review the errors listed in the ^TMP("DVBA",$J) Global.
{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Correct the errors listed.
{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       KILL the Global TMP("DVBA",$J).



Attachment B - Post-Init Rerun


The post-init routine has been programmed to allow the user to rerun it should a problem develop and the routine error out.  The following entry points have been created.  These entry points should be rerun after correction of the specific error that occurred as described below

^DVBAPOST
This routine should be rerun after the correction of an error that occurred while setting up VA FileMan or VA List Manager templates or errors that occurred while setting up VA List Manager protocols.

EN0^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed if an error occurs in the post-init while setting up necessary local variables.

EN1^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error that occurs while mailing the bulletin that indicates the pre-init did not run OK.

EN2^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while updating the LONG DESCRIPTION field (#10) in the Disability Condition file (#31).

EN3^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while adding Disability Condition file (#31) to the Local LOOKUP file (#8984.4).

EN5^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while entering keywords into the Multi-Term Lookup files.

EN6^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while entering synonyms into the Multi-Term Lookup files.

EN7^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while entering the disability codes into the 2507 Body System file (#396.7).

EN8^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while entering disability codes into the AMIE Exam file (#396.6).

EN10^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while entering the exam exceptions into the EXAM EXCEPTIONS file (#396.93).

EN11^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while adding new entries to the DISABILITY CONDITION file (#31).

MAIL^DVBAPOST
This entry point should be executed after the correction of an error occurring while the post-init is mailing the final bulletin upon completion of the initialization.


After the post-init has completed processing, both the user running the init and the Postmaster will be sent a MailMan message containing a log of any problems that occurred during the init.  Listed below are the possible errors that may be reported in the MailMan message or to the screen during the post-init, followed by a brief description of the error and instructions for correcting it.


A.      KERNEL v7.2 of MTLU is not installed.
Consult the AMIE Install Guide for details.
I am stopping the INIT!

This message will be generated if the pre-init does not find the correct version of KERNEL in the account into which you are installing.  Install the correct version of KERNEL, then run the AMIE init again.

B.      The pre-init found a problem in the version of MTLU and KERNEL.
Please review and correct.  See install guide for further details.

This indicates basically the same thing as the previous error message.  Correct it in the same manner and restart the post-init as follows:  D EN0^DVBAPOST.

C.      XXXX is not a valid exam in the AMIE Exam file.  ZZZZ Exam exception not added.

This error will not stop the successful completion of the post-init.  This message indicates that the post-init tried to add the exam exception ZZZZ but was unable to because the AMIE Exam XXXX did not exist in the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6).  If this should occur, check the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6) for the existence of this AMIE exam.  If it is misspelled, change the spelling to match what is shown in the message.  If it is not present, consult your ISC for the proper setting of that exam.  If the problem has been corrected, the following routine can be rerun to try again:  D ^DVBAORPH.

D.      Addition of exam exception ZZZZ has failed.  Please consult install guide.

This error does not stop the successful completion of the post-init.  The addition of the exam exception ZZZZ has failed.  Check to ensure that the exam exception does not already exist or that the AMIE exam it is pointing to does not exist.  This exam information can be obtained at line label TXT of DVBAORPH.  Once this problem is corrected, the following routine can be rerun:  D ^DVBAORPH.

E.      Unable to add the variable pointer to file ####.  Check the AMIE Install Guide for details.

The #.02 Field of either the Local Keyword file (#8984.1) or the Local Shortcut file (#8984.2) contain variable pointers with a prefix of "DVBA".  If this error should occur, contact your ISC.

F.      Unable to add the new entry 'Disability Condition' to the Local Lookup file.  Check the AMIE Install Guide for details.

Addition of the new local lookup entry has failed.  Check the Local LOOKUP file (#8984.4) for the cause.  Once corrected, rerun the post-init in the following fashion:  D SET^DVBAPOST,EN3^DVBAPOST.

G.      An entry for the 'Disability Condition' file in the Local Lookup file already exists.  Check the AMIE Install Guide for details.

If this error occurs, an entry already exists in the Local LOOKUP file (#8984.4).  Check the Local Keyword (#8984.1) and Local Shortcut files, Field #.02 for the variable pointer to File #31.  If all of these are in place, this section is OK.  If not, delete the entry from the Local Lookup file (#8984.4) using VA FileMan.  Rerun the post-init as follows:
D SET^DVBAPOST,EN3^DVBAPOST.

H.      Prefix DVBA not set up on AMIE Site Parameter file.  Conversion aborted!

This message is generated during the update of the Multi-Term Lookup files with keywords.  If the pre-init did not properly populate the POST INIT VARIABLES field in the AMIE Site Parameter file (#396.1), the keyword update cannot run and will be aborted before it begins.  Correct the value in this field and rerun the post-init as follows:  D SET^DVBAPOST,EN5^DVBAPOST.

I.      Addition of KEYWORD {keyword} for code {code} has FAILED.  Please investigate!

This message is generated during the update of the Multi-Term Lookup files with keywords.  IRM should verify the Local Keyword file (#8984.1) to see that the reported keyword for the reported disability code was not added.  IRM will also want to check the value that the post-init is attempting to enter into the ENTRY field of the Local Keyword file (#8984.1).

J.      Could not find the {code} in the 'C' X-ref.  Please investigate!

This message is generated during the update of the Multi-Term Lookup files with keywords.  IRM should investigate the "C" cross-reference on the Disability Condition file (#31) for the code displayed.

NOTE:  If the update of the Local Keyword file (#8984.1) with keywords aborts to the programmer level, IRM should note the value of DA.  First display this local variable with the ZWrite command; then note its value.  This will be helpful in determining how the record being written to the Local Keyword file (#8984.1) was left upon the abort.

K.      Term {term} Not in Local Lookup File or Addition Failed.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while adding a medical term to the Local Synonym file (#8984.3).  IRM should compare the term in the DVBAPS1 routine and compare it to the Data Dictionary field definitions in the Local Synonym file (#8984.3).  For example, a term should be all upper case or the addition will fail.  It is also important to note that if a term does not get added to the Local Synonym file (#8984.3), none of its synonyms will be added to the file.

L.      Addition of synonym {synonym} to {term} has failed.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while adding a synonym to a term in the Local Synonym file (#8984.3).  IRM should compare the synonym in the DVBAPS1 routine and compare it to the Data Dictionary field definitions in the Local Synonym file (#8984.3).  For example, a synonym should be all upper case or the addition will fail.

M.      Could not add code {code} to body system {body system}.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while adding a disability code to a particular body system in the 2507 Body System file (#396.7).  IRM should check to see if the disability code is correct in the data routines DVBAPB*.  If it is not correct in the data routines, the correction should be made.  If it is a correct disability code, IRM should check its existence in the Disability CONDITION file ^DIC(31).  If the disability code does not exist in the Disability CONDITION file (#31), IRM should contact the ISC.  

N.      Could not find body system {body system}.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while trying to locate the body system in the 2507 Body System file (#396.7).  IRM should check to see if the body system is entered correctly in the data routines DVBAPB*.  If it is not a correct body system, the data routines should be updated.  If it is a correct body system, IRM should check for its existence in the 2507 Body System file (#396.7).  If the body system does not exist in the 2507 Body System file (#396.7), IRM should contact the ISC.

O.      Could not find AMIE exam {worksheet description}.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while looking for the work sheet in the AMIE Exam file (#396.6).  IRM should check to see if the work sheet description is entered correctly in the data routines DVBAPW*.  If the description is not correct in the data routines, the change should be made.  If it is a correct work sheet description, IRM should then check for its existence in the AMIE Exam file (#396.6).  If the work sheet description is not in the AMIE Exam file (#396.6), IRM should contact the ISC. 

P.      Addition of exam {code} to {worksheet description} has failed.

This error is generated when a problem occurs when trying to add a disability code to a work sheet entry in the AMIE Exam file (#396.6).  IRM should check to see if the disability code is entered correctly in the data routines DVBAPW*.  If the disability code is not correct in the data routines DVBAPW*, it should be changed to the correct code.  If it is a correct disability code, IRM should then check for its existence in the Disability CONDITION file ^DIC(31).  If the disability code is not in the Disability CONDITION file (#31), IRM should contact the ISC.

Q.      Problems exists with the disability condition {code}.
        Long description NOT added!

This error is generated when a problem occurs while updating the Long Description field (#10) in the Disability Condition file (#31).  This error may result from the lack of a "C" cross-reference on the reported code or a missing zero node for the reported code.  IRM should check for the existence of a "C" cross-reference for that code.  If that cross-reference exists, the existence of the zero node for internal entry number pointed to by that "C" cross-reference should be checked.  The Global Listing utility can be used to aid in this diagnosis.  It will be necessary to research and correct this problem.  Once corrected, the post-init can be rerun as follows:
D SET,EN^DVBAPLNG,MAIL^DVBAPOST

R.      Unable to get the proper index and prefix from the AMIE Site Parameter file.  Check the AMIE install Guide for details.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while updating the Local LOOKUP file (#8984.4).  It indicates either a problem with the data contained in the field Post Init Scratch (#90) in the AMIE Site Parameter file (#396.1) or the current existence of the cross-reference "ADVB" on the Local Shortcut file (#8984.2).  IRM should first use VA FileMan to check the value of the field Post Init Scratch (#90) in the AMIE Site Parameter file (#396.1).  The value in this field should be "DVBA;ADVB".  If this field contains the correct information, IRM should then check for the "ADVB" cross-reference on the Local Shortcut file (#8984.2).

S.      Disability Condition {code} was not added.  Entry already exists.

This error is generated when a problem occurs while updating the Disability Condition file (#31) with a new disability code.  It indicates that the code displayed is already contained in the Disability Condition file (#31).  IRM should use VA FileMan to check for the existence of the code in File #31.  If the code exists, IRM should check for the integrity of the information on that record.  If the integrity is OK, there is no problem.  If not, the erroneous information should be corrected.

T.      Not able to add Disability Condition {code}.  Consult the Install Guide.

This error indicates that the disability condition code was not successfully added to File #31.  IRM should contact the ISC to make arrangements to add the code to the Disability Condition file (#31).  This may be done using the Enter/Edit option of VA FileMan and referencing the TXT tag lines in the DVBAPADD routine.  IRM may also correct the condition causing the failure and rerun the post-init by calling the tag EN11^DVBAPOST from programmer mode.

U.      Mail Message containing Error Log has failed!
        Errors contained in the ^TMP("DVBA",{#}) global.
        Investigate this global to determine any existing problems

This error will not be contained in the mail message that includes the error messages.  This message is displayed to the screen if a problem occurs while the mail message is being sent.  If this message displays to the screen, the mail message will not be received.  IRM should first try to mail the message again by calling the entry point MAIL^DVBAPOST from programmer mode.  If this does not work, the Global Listing tool can be used to review the errors that occurred during the post-initialization.  The Global array ^TMP("DVBA",$J contains those errors.  That global should be KILLed after reviewing the errors and the ^TMP Global.

        Any PIMS Scheduling option from which an appointment
         may be made


Insufficient 2507 Exam Tracking
AMIE allows the entry of 2507 requests with a priority of INSUFFICIENT EXAM whenever a completed 2507 request is returned to the regional office lacking the information necessary to adjudicate the veteran's claim.  This enhancement allows the linking of insufficient 2507 requests to the originally entered request.

        Pending Form 7131 Requests Report
        Beneficiary Information Status Inquiry
        7131 Divisional Transfer (New Option)


Inactivation of AMIE Exams
Each AMIE exam has a corresponding name and worksheet number.  There are two worksheet numbers that have more than one exam name associated with them which reference and display the same information.  There should only be one active exam associated with each worksheet.  It has been decided by the AMIE Expert Panel (EP) that the Regular Aid and Attendance and the Scars AMIE exams be marked as inactive.

Option(s) Affected:     Add an Exam to an Existing Request
        Transcribe C&P Data
        Print/Reprint C&P Work Sheets

        Cancel C&P Requests/Exams
        Reopen C&P Requests/Exams (Supervisors Only)


Reprinting 21 Day Certificates by Name or SSN in addition to Date
Currently, a 21 Day Certificate can only be reprinted by the original processing date (the date the 21 Day Certificate was printed).  This enhancement allows the user to reprint a 21 Day Certificate by the veteran's name or social security number, as well as the original processing date.  Also included in this enhancement is the ability to print 7131s by veteran's name or social security number in addition to the date of the 7131 request.

Option(s) Affected:     Reprint 21-day Certificates for MAS
        New Form 7131 Request Report

Pending 21 Day Certificates Report
The 21-day Cert/Notice of Discharge Report option currently prints a report of both the 21 Day Certificates and the Notices of Discharge.  It is not possible to print just the pending 21 Day Certificate report or just the pending Notice of Discharge report.  This enhancement allows the user to print both reports (current functionality), print only the pending 21 Day Certificate report, or only the pending Notice of Discharge report.

Option(s) Affected:     21-day Cert/Notice of Discharge Report


Purging Parameter for 2507 Requests
Currently, the AMIE package keeps 2507 requests for a preset amount of time before they are purged from the system.  This enhancement allows the individual medical centers to select the length of time to keep completed 2507 exams.

Option(s) Affected:     Purge Old 2507 Requests (TaskMan)


Mapped Printing/Super Quit Keys
This enhancement allows the use of function keys to perform the printing and super quit actions during operation of the on-line Physician's Guide.  (NOTE:  Super Quit is a function that returns the user back to the menu containing the Physician's Guide option.)

Option(s) Affected:     Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Exams


More Keywords for Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Examinations
Currently, there is a National Keyword List associated with specific disability exams which allows the user to quickly and easily locate an exam in the Physician's Guide.  This enhancement adds additional words and phrases to the distributed National Keyword List.  These additional keywords are supplied by the Physician's Guide Work Group.

Option(s) Affected:     Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Exams

Addition of Keywords to the Exam Exceptions for the Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Examinations
The current keywords available to assist the users in getting to an exam are only available for exams that have an associated diagnostic code.  There are several exams that do not have an associated diagnostic code.  These exams are referenced as Exam Exceptions.  Adding keywords to the exams in the Exam Exceptions makes these exams easily accessible to the users and promotes consistency across examinations.  These keywords are supplied by the Physician's Guide Work Group.

Option(s) Affected:     Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Exams


Exam Introductions Selection added to the Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Examinations
Currently, the Overview selection contains the general overviews and exam introductions.  This enhancement separates the overviews and the exam introductions into two separate selections.  The result is an Overview selection and an Exam Introductions selection.  The Overview selection contains general overviews for the Physician's Guide.  The Exam Introductions selection contains introductions to any of the exams contained in the Physician's Guide.  Both selections contain the corresponding overviews and introductions from version 2.6 and any added overviews or introductions.

Option(s) Affected:     Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Exams


Addition of Descriptions on the Initial, Reevaluation, Overview, and Exam Introductions Selections for the Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Examinations
This enhancement adds a brief description after each of the prompt selections for Initial, Reevaluation, Overview, and Exam Introductions selections.  This description gives the user a better idea of what each selection is about.

Option(s) Affected:     Physician's Guide for Disability Evaluation Exams

Technical Release Notes

I.      Data Dictionary

A.      FORM 7131 file  ^DVB(396,

21 DAY CERT RELEASE STATUS field (#6.82) contained a 'C' cross-reference.  VA FileMan attempted to use this cross-reference during lookups on this file.  This lookup did not work correctly.  Version 2.7 of AMIE changes this cross-reference to 'AC'.  This prevents VA FileMan from using it during a lookup.  All other functionality should remain the same.

Nodes 6 & 7 are added with V. 2.7.  Division and transfer date fields are added for each report field on a 7131.  The 'AE' and 'AF' cross-references are added for these new fields.

The 'AE' cross-reference has been added for the DATE OF REQUEST (#23) and DIVISION (#29) fields.


B.      AMIE SITE PARAMETER file        ^DVB(396.1,

        2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS field (#14) was added.  This field controls the 2507 requests to review when running the C&P Exam Integrity Report.

        APPT LINKING ENHANCED DIALOGUE field (#17) was added.  This field is an on/off switch that controls the prompts which may be displayed when making C&P appointments.

        DAYS TO KEEP 2507 HISTORY field (#.11) was added.  This field holds the number of days to keep 2507 requests.

C.      2507 REQUEST file       ^DVB(396.3,

REQUEST STATUS field (#17) contained a 'D' cross-reference.  VA FileMan attempted to use this cross-reference during lookups on this file.  This lookup did not work correctly.  Version 2.7 of AMIE changes this cross-reference to 'AF'.  This prevents VA FileMan from using it during a lookup.  All other functionality should remain the same.

Two fields have been added to this file.  The orIginal 2507 request field (#44) is a pointer to the 2507 request the priority insufficient request is entered for.  If the original 2507 request has been purged, the original 2507 processing time is used for the priority insufficient 2507.  The original 2507 processing time field (#45) holds the processing time of the original request.

Two cross-references have been added to this file.  The 'ADP' cross-reference has been added for use by the Summary Insufficient Exam report.  The 'AORQ' cross-reference has been added for purging old 2507 requests.


D.      2507 EXAM file  ^DVB(396.4,

        Three new fields and one cross-reference have been added to this file.  The insufficient remarks field (#80) was added to allow the regional office to provide specifics when a 2507 exam is returned as insufficient.  Original providEr field (#.12) was added to hold the name of the provider who completed the original exam.  Insufficient reason field (#.11) was added to hold the reason the original exam was insufficient.  The 'AIT' cross-reference was added for use by the Detailed Insufficient Exam report.


E.      2507 INSUFFICIENT REASONS file  ^DVB(396.94,

        This is a new file used when priority insufficient 2507 requests are entered.  It is installed with data and contains reasons an exam may be returned as insufficient.


F.      AMIE C&P EXAM TRACKING file     ^DVB(396.95,

        This is a new file used to keep historical information for C&P exam appointments.  It is used to adjust the total processing time for AMIE 2507 requests.

G.      Local Keyword file      ^XT(8984.1,
        Local SHORTCUT file     ^XT(8984.2,
        Local Synonym file      ^XT(8984.3,

        No new fields are being added to these files, although a new variable pointer is being added to the Local Keyword (#8984.1) and Local SHORTCUT (#8984.2) files in the ENTRY field (#.02) of each.  This new variable pointer is to allow for the lookup on the EXAM EXCEPTIONS file (#396.93).  Entries for the LOCAL Keyword (#8984.1) file will be added during the post-init.


H.      Local Lookup file       ^XT(8984.4,

        No new fields have been added to this KERNEL file.  AMIE 2.7 adds an entry to this file in order to use MTLU on the EXAM EXCEPTIONS file (#396.93).  Along with this new entry is an index and display protocol.

III.    Menu Options

The Request for 7131 Information (Non-Admitted Vets) option is put out of order.  It is also removed from the Regional Office Main Menu.  No renumbering of menu options takes place.  This option may be removed from any secondary menu options.  Once this is done, the option may be deleted altogether.

The Request for 7131 Information (Admitted Vets) option is renamed to Request for 7131 Information.  This option remains as Option Number 1.  With the new functionality for entering 7131s, only this option is needed.

DVBA C MEDICAL ADMIN C&P menu has the AMIE/C&P Appointment Link Management option added as Option Number 12.

DVBA C REGIONAL OFF RPT menu has the Insufficient Exam Report option added as Option Number 6.

DVBA C MEDICAL ADM REPORT menu has the Insufficient Exam Report option added as Option Number 10.

V.      Miscellaneous

In V. 2.7, AMIE no longer makes the call to the LetterMan Editor in the Transcribe C&P Data option.  Sites need to evaluate this change and possibly use the Preferred Editor to allow selection of the LetterMan Editor.  Information about the Preferred Editor is available in the Kernel documentation.

The Physician's Guide now uses two function keys, F9 and F12, to execute the actions "Print List" and "Super Quit" respectively.

AMIE now utilizes the PATIENT file (#2) claim folder location field (#.314) instead of #.312.


VI.     Protocols

DVBA C&P SCHD EVENT is added to the PROTOCOL file (#101).  It asks a series of questions when a user makes a C&P appointment.  This protocol is added as an item on the SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS protocol.  What questions the user is prompted with may be adjusted with the APPT LINKING ENHANCED DIALOGUE field (#17) in the AMIE SITE PARAMETER file (#396.1).  (See AMIE Site Parameter file in the technical release notes section of this document.)


VII.    Printer Configuration

Numerous regional offices have reported blank pages printing throughout their C&P Final Reports.  This can be corrected by making a change to the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2) in one of two ways.

1.  Set up a new terminal type, "P-OTHER.xxx", (xxx being whatever characters you choose).  Make the characteristics of this terminal type the same as "P-OTHER" except set the page length field (#3) to 58.  This option is the preferred choice if terminal type "P-OTHER" is used by other DHCP reports.

2.  Edit terminal type "P-OTHER" so that the page length field (#3) is set to 58.  Before taking this action, ensure terminal type "P-OTHER" is not used by other DHCP reports.

Once the terminal type is defined, all regional offices dialing into your medical center utilizing AMIE should be notified to use the correct terminal type when printing/reprinting C&P Final Reports.

If feasible, naming of the terminal type used should be coordinated with the IRM staffs of other medical centers so that regional offices are using the same terminal type name at each of the medical centers they work with.

Regional Office Release Notes


The regional office release notes describe enhancement and functionality changes to the regional office portion of the AMIE package.

User Release Notes

Combining Options for Entering 7131 for Admitted Veterans and 7131 for Non-Admitted Veterans
Entering a 7131 for an admitted veteran and for a non-admitted veteran is currently two separate options.  If a veteran is admitted, you cannot enter a request for 7131 through the non-admitted veterans option and the non-admitted veterans request cannot be entered through the admitted veterans option.  In AMIE 2.7, these two options are combined.

Option(s) Affected:     Request for 7131 Information (Admitted Veterans)
        Request for 7131 Information (Non-admitted Veterans)

New Option:     Request for 7131 Information


Reverse Print Order of Admission Dates - 7131 Requests
When the regional office enters a 7131 request, the prompt for admission date displays the dates in chronological order.  AMIE 2.7 displays the dates in reverse chronological order so that the most recent dates are viewed first.

New Option:     Request for 7131 Information


Discharge Types for Discharge Report and Report for Pension and A&A
The regional office Discharge Report  and Report for Pension and A&A options currently allow the user to select any of the patient movement types.  This enhancement limits the type of selectable movements to discharge types.  A default list of the ten types most often requested has been formulated by the AMIE EP.  This default list is utilized to generate the discharge report.

Option(s) Affected:     Discharge Report
        Report for Pension and A&A

Inactivation of AMIE Exams
Each AMIE exam has a corresponding name and worksheet number.  There are two worksheet numbers that have more than one exam name associated with them which reference and display the same information.  There should only be one active exam associated with each worksheet.  It has been decided by the AMIE Expert Panel (EP) that the Regular Aid and Attendance and the Scars AMIE exams be marked as inactive.

Option(s) Affected:     Enter a C&P Exam Request
        Add an Exam to an Existing Request
        Cancel C&P Requests/Exams


Reprinting 21 Day Certificates by Name or SSN in addition to Date
Currently, a 21 Day Certificate can only be reprinted by the original processing date (the date the 21 Day Certificate was printed).  This enhancement allows the user to reprint a 21 Day Certificate by the veteran's name or social security number, as well as the original processing date.  Also included in this enhancement is the ability to print 7131s by veteran's name or social security number in addition to the date of the 7131 request.

Option(s) Affected:     Reprint a 21-day Certificate for the RO


Claim Folder Location
As the result of changes to the PATIENT file (#2), AMIE is making a change to the use of the PATIENT file CLAIM FOLDER LOCATION field (#.314).  When the regional office is entering a new patient to the PATIENT file, this enhancement allows selection of a claim folder location by station number, name, or from a list of institutions.

Option(s) Affected:     Enter a C&P Exam Request


Start/Stop 35 Day Clock for AMIS 290
The 2507 average processing time reported on the AMIE AMIS 290 is changed to include adjustments made to the processing time of 2507 requests as the result of veterans cancelling C&P appointments.

Option(s) Affected:     AMIS 290 for the Regional Office

Insufficient 2507 Exam Tracking
AMIE allows the entry of 2507 requests with a priority of INSUFFICIENT EXAM whenever a completed 2507 request is returned to the regional office lacking the information necessary to adjudicate the veteran's claim.  This enhancement allows the linking of insufficient 2507 requests to the originally entered request.

Option(s) Affected:     Enter a C&P Exam Request
        Print C&P Final Report (Manual)
        Reprint C&P Final Report
        Add an Exam to an Existing Request
        

Option added to the Regional
Office Reports Menu:    Insufficient Exam Report


Divisional Transfer of 7131
This enhancement allows the staff at a multidivisional medical center to transfer any portion of a 7131 between their divisions.

Option(s) Affected:     Pending Form 7131 Requests Report
        Beneficiary Information Status Inquiry


Device Selection Change
Numerous regional offices have reported blank pages printing throughout their C&P Final Reports.  This can be corrected by the medical centers making a change to the terminal type you select at the "output device" prompt when utilizing the final report options.  The medical center technical release notes in this manual provide instructions for making the change.

You may want to contact the medical center IRM Service to determine if the change has been made and what you should enter at the "output device" prompt (the default of "P-OTHER" may still be appropriate).

Option(s) Affected:     Print C&P Final Report (Manual)
        Reprint C&P Final Report



Appendix


Hints to Facilitate the Adjustment of the Processing Time of 2507 Requests due to Cancellations at the Veteran's Request

A key to understanding the automatic adjustment of 2507 processing times due to veteran cancellations is to understand that the important points in the history of the appointments scheduled to complete an examination must be tracked.  Appointment history tracking is accomplished through the proper linking of C&P appointments to the 2507 requests that have prompted their scheduling.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The AMIE C&P EXAM TRACKING file (#396.95) keeps appointment history via links between C&P appointments and 2507 requests.  A single link should be included in this file for each unique set of appointments scheduled to complete a single examination.  In other words, if a radiology exam was scheduled and then cancelled and rescheduled, there should be a single link in the tracking file to indicate the appointment history that occurred to complete the radiology exam.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The tracking of appointment history can be made significantly easier if the APPT LINKING ENHANCED DIALOGUE parameter is set to ON in the AMIE Site Parameter file (# 396.1).  This parameter may be turned on or off through the Regional File Site Parameter Setup option.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Turning the APPT LINKING ENHANCED DIALOGUE parameter to ON will add history tracking prompts to the options that allow the scheduling of C&P appointments.  If these prompts are correctly answered, the C&P appointment to 2507 request links will be properly maintained.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Turning the APPT LINKING ENHANCED DIALOGUE parameter to OFF will require the site to maintain the C&P appointment to 2507 request links through the AMIE/C&P Appointment Link Management option if they want AMIE to adjust the processing time of their 2507 requests.

{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The user may inspect the C&P appointment to 2507 request links when scheduling a C&P appointment.  The links are displayed for selection when the following prompt is answered YES.

This 2507 already has appointments.
   Enter '?' for help
Is this appointment due to a cancellation? NO// YES 


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The user may also inspect the links through the AMIE/C&P Appointment Link Management option with selection number 1 from the screen titled "Select an appointment to link to the 2507 request".


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       Duplicate links can be created by answering NO to the prompt "Was {appt date} scheduled to rebook a previous appointment?" after selecting a previously linked appointment, if the previously created link for that appointment has been rescheduled and linked to a different "Current Appt" date.  This allows the software to be flexible enough to handle the rescheduling of part of an examination because an exam was not completed due to a veteran's action, (i.e., he or she was late to the appointment).


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       When inspecting current C&P appointment to 2507 request links, the user may see "*CL" before the status listed with the appointment.  "*CL" indicates that the listed appointment is the "Current Appt" date on one of the links to that 2507 request.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The AMIE software allows the user to link appointments to 2507 exams cancelled on the 2507.  This is to allow the adjustment of processing time if an appointment is cancelled more than an allowable number of times by the veteran, causing the 2507 exam requested to be cancelled and the 2507 to be completed/released back to the regional office.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       It is suggested that, when possible, the clerk scheduling and/or linking C&P appointments should have the 2507 available for reference.

{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       The report generated with the Check C&P File Integrity option or the Check C&P File Integrity (TaskMan) option has been changed to include information to assist the medical center in linking C&P appointments to 2507 requests.  This report can be customized with the 2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS parameter in the AMIE Site Parameter file (#396.1).  If this report is not OFF, it can potentially be large if the site does not set up C&P appointment to 2507 request links.  As the site builds its' links, the report will become shorter.  This will likely be the case when AMIE V. 2.7 is first installed because no link history will exist.


{SYMBOL 183 \f "Symbol" \s 10 \h}       It is suggested that the medical center continue to track adjustments to 2507 request processing times on paper for two months while building appointment history in the AMIE C&P EXAM TRACKING file (#396.95).
