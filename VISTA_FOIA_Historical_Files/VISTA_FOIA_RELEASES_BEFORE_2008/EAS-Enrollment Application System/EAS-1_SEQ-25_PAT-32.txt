Subject: REMOVING APPOINTMENT BLOCKING FUNCTIONALITY 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 NOTE: This patch is being released as part of a HOST file distribution.  
 The primary patch for this distribution is SD*5.3*296.
  
 This patch addresses two of the changes requested in an Executive 
 Decision Memo sponsored by the VHA Chief Business Office (CBO) regarding 
 Veteran Financial Assessments. In response to Policy Board (NLB) comment 
 on the VHA Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) process, the CBO 
 requests the removal of:
  
 (1) the current restriction that blocks transmission of outpatient 
 encounters (ACRP) and inpatient episodes of care (PTF) to the National 
 Patient Care Database (NPCD) if a veteran's updated financial assessment 
 (Means Test) information is not complete, and (2) the restriction that 
 blocks the ability to schedule future appointments for veterans whose 
 financial assessments need updating.
  
 Current policy establishes a requirement to block transmission of 
 outpatient encounters (ACRP) and inpatient episodes of care (PTF) to the 
 National Patient Care Database if the patient's current Means Test status 
 equals "Required."  This leads to under-reported workload and inaccurate 
 information in national databases.  Although this change will remove the 
 restriction, site personnel are encouraged to have the patient complete 
 Means and Copay Tests when applicable.
  
 The provision of veterans' clinical care should be separated from the 
 administrative requirement placed on staff to obtain updated financial 
 data from the veteran.  Changing the policies and implementing these 
 software changes will lead to rapid improvements in correcting the 
 under-reporting of workload to Austin, decrease the risk of veterans not 
 receiving clinically-required future appointments, maximize revenue 
 collection and improve the accuracy of corporate-level data.
  
 This patch provides a post installation routine that will update the text 
 of the EAS Means Test letters to reflect the change in business rules 
 outlined above, i.e. sections referring to "prevent us from being able to 
 schedule you for any future care" will be replaced with "cause your 
 priority for enrollment in the VA health care system to lapse".  This 
 routine will automatically update the 60, 30, and 0-day letters.
