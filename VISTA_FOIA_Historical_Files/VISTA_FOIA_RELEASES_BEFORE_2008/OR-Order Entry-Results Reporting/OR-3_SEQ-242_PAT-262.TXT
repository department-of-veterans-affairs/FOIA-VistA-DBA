Subject: HEALTH SUMMARY CASE seNsITive REPORT PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
 This patch addresses an identified Patient Safety Issue (PSI)
 PSI-06-081
  
 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE: CPRS, VistAWeb, Health Summary, Remote Data Views
 CPRS (and the soon-to-be-released version 5 of VistAWeb) can query
 remote sites for locally defined Health Summary "types". If site
 "A" has a local Health Summary "type" called "MEDICINE INFO", and
 the CPRS user does a Remote Data Views lookup for this Health
 Summary Report, remote sites that have local Health Summary
 "types" of the same "Name" will return the info back to the CPRS
 user. However, the comparison of the local "Type" "Name" and the
 remote "Type" "Name" is case sensitive in part. The "Type" "Name"
 at site "A" is converted to uppercase and compared to "Type" "Names"
 at remote sites. But the remote site "Type" "Names" are not converted
 to uppercase during this comparison. So, if site A requests from
 site B, the following will occur:
  
 Site A: "MEDICINE INFO", site B: "MEDICINE INFO" -> site B returns data
 Site A: "MEDICINE INFO", site B: "Medicine Info" -> site B returns
         "MEDICINE INFO NOT DEFINED"
 Site A: "Medicine Info", site B: "MEDICINE INFO" -> site B returns data
 Site A: "Medicine Info", site B: "Medicine Info" -> site B returns
         "MEDICINE INFO NOT DEFINED"

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 Problem:
 -------
 HD149298
  
 CPRS (and the soon-to-be-released version 5 of VistAWeb) can query
 remote sites for locally defined Health Summary "types". If site "A" has
 a local Health Summary "type" called "MEDICINE INFO", and the CPRS
 user does a Remote Data Views lookup for this Health Summary Report,
 remote sites that have local Health Summary "types" of the same "Name" 
 will return the info back to the CPRS user.
 However, the comparison of the local "Type" "Name" and the remote 
 "Type" "Name" is case sensitive in part.
 The "Type" "Name" at site "A" is converted to uppercase and compared to
 "Type" "Names" at remote sites. But the remote site "Type" "Names" are
 not converted to uppercase during this comparison.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 This patch fixes this problem by removing the case sensitive
 restrictions in the code, where the NAME and TITLE fields in the
 HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142) are used.
