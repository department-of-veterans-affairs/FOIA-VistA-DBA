 rather than NPCD.

 ISB-0700-30733 ERRORS IN FILE 409.76
 
   Problem:
   --------
 The site has reported that error codes 704, 903, 706, 005 have been
 incorrectly marked with the source of error being VISTA when it should have
 been NPCD.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
 A post-init routine was created to correct the SOURCE OF ERROR in each of the
 above reported error codes.
 
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 
 A post-init routine was created to replace error codes 704, 903, 706,
 and 005 SOURCE OF ERROR, file TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR CODE
 (409.76) field .02 from VISTA (V) to NPCD (N). A VA Fileman call with DIE was
 used to correct this problem. The post-init routine is SD53P359.

  patch be installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users.
  
  This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation will
  take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1. Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
     section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this
     time.
  
  2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select

      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines and
         options).
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
