Subject: CORRECT UNDEFINED LOCATION ERROR IN VERIFY INVOICES OPTION.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects a problem that causes an undefined error when
 using the option PSA VERIFY INVOICES. The error occurs if there is 
 no pharmacy location or an invalid location on the invoice.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
   
 Problem:
 --------
 As reported in NOIS PHI-0603-20056, the Pharmacy Supervisor was using the
 Menu option 'Verify Invoices' [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] and chose an order 
 to edit when an undefined variable error occurred. The undefined error 
 occurred because the location variable was set to zero due to either
 no pharmacy location or an invalid location. The routine PSAVER1 failed
 to check the result for the site lookup. A check of the location variable
 is required after the lookup. If the site lookup returns a zero, 
 then processing needs to terminate the lookup in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
 STATS file (File 58.8).
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
        
 Routine PSAVER1 was modified at line tag CORR+4. A check of the site variable
 PSALOC was inserted to prevent an undefined error in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY
 STATS file (File 58.8).
