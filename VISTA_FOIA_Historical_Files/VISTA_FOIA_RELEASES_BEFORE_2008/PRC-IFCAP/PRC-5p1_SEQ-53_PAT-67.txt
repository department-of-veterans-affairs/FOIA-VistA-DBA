 In an effort to reduce the possibility that the automatic running of the 
 Accrual (Monthly) [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL] option by TaskMan could result 
 in a recompiling of the report data, it is required that the scheduling 
 of this option be removed from TaskMan before midnight April 30, 2003.  
 After the option has been removed from scheduling, it will be necessary 
 for each site to run the option manually each month.  Manually running 
 the option should be done with enough time left in the month to allow for 
 corrections to be made before the report must be submitted.  Effective 
 January 31, 2003, all end of month reporting to FMS must be completed by 
 8:00 P.M. Central Time on the last workday of the month. There is a one 
 day overlap period for purposes of correction and resubmission.  
 Effective October 31, 2003 there will no longer be a one day overlap and 
 the submission time will remain 8:00 P.M. Central Time on the last 
 workday of the month.
  
 Personnel in the finance offices will shortly be receiving an 
 informational/instructional memo from VACO with text that is very similar 
 to the text provided below.  The actual text of the VACO memo is likely 
 to be different in its final form; however, the information contained in 
 the memo should be consistent with what is provided here.  It is included 
 in this patch to provide another source from which this information can 
 be procured.
  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 An informational IFCAP patch has been released to your local IRM staff 
 that removes the tasked procedure to compile your Monthly Purchase Card
 Accrual.  In the past, this task was scheduled to run at 1:00 A.M. the
 first workday of the month.  Due to the change to a one-day overlap period
 in our current environment, and no overlap effective October 31, 2003, the
 automated compiling of this report is no longer the most efficient way to
 begin the purchase card accrual process.  
  
 As you know, the PC accrual process is a three-step procedure.  The first 
 step is the compiling and printing of the report,  the second step is the
 editing of the report, and the final step is the creation of the code
 sheets based on the edited report.  In the past, step one was automated.  
 Your printed report was likely sitting on your accounting technician's
 printer when he/she came to work the first workday of the month.  You now
 must go to your Accrual menu to Compile/Print your report.  A sample of
 the menu tree is captured below:
  
 Select Funds Distribution & Accounting Menu Option: Funds Distribution 
 Program Menu
  
 Select Funds Distribution Program Menu Option: Transaction Menu
  
 Select Transaction Menu Option: Accrual (Monthly)
 For Accrual Month/Year: 04/03//      Fiscal Month/Year: 07/2003
  
      Select one of the following:
           1         Compile/Print Monthly Accrual
           2         Edit Monthly Accrual
           3         Generate/Rebuild FMS SV-Document
  
 Select Number: 1
  
 One size no longer fits all.  Your sites' purchase card volume will likely
 dictate when you will compile this report to meet the new month-end
 timelines.  The suggestion to have Austin hold purchase card payments from
 being processed in FMS and transferred to IFCAP for one or two days at
 month-end, (similar to the present year-end process), was considered.  
 Although it had merit, the disruption of the normal business flow on a
 monthly basis seems to outweigh the benefits of holding the payment
 processing.  Austin will continue the procedure of holding payments at 
 year-end.  
  
 It should be recognized that due to the fact that payment information will
 be hitting our records after we have compiled, edited and generated our
 accrual, the accrual will not be 100% accurate.  The impact of that
 inaccuracy should be minimal due to the fact that the entries will be
 reversed the next day.  It should also be recognized that even in the days
 of the four-day overlap the accrual was likely less than 100% accurate due
 to the fact that cardholders could be reconciling transactions in the
 period between when the report was originally compiled and when the code
 sheets were generated to Austin.
