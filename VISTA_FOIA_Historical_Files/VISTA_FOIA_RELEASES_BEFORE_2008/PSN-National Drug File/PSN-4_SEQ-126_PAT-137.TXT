Subject: MODIFY T CROSS REFERENCE IN NDC/UPN FILE (#50.67)

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 The "T" cross reference on the TRADE NAME field (#4) in the NDC/UPN file
 (#50.67) currently stores only the first thirty characters of the field.
 Developers of the ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING application have requested
 that this cross reference store the entire field.  This patch accomplishes
 that change.
