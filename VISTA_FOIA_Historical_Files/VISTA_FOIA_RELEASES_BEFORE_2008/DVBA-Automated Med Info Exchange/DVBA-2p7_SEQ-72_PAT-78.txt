Description:
============

 Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation &
 Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) Phase II provides VistA updates necessary
 to support the new Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam template
 functionality implemented during Phase I of the CAPRI CPWM project.
  
 The goal of the CAPRI CPWM project is to implement the current Automated
 Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) C&P exam worksheets in an electronic
 format that will upload exam results into Text Integration Utility (TIU)
 and make the results visible to Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 users.
  
 CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*66.  This CAPRI GUI version
 should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in the C&P process,
 from the examiners actually performing the C&P exams to the administrative
 clerk who coordinates the exam processing.  Please refer to patches
 DVBA*2.7*53, DVBA*2.7*66, and DVBA*2.7*68 for further information on CAPRI
 CPWM.
  
 This patch installs 20 new C&P exam templates as well as updates to the
 exam 17 templates released with patch DVBA*2.7*68.  The templates
 addressed in this patch are: 
 -       AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION
 -       ARRHYTHMIAS
 -       ARTERIES, VEINS AND MISCELLANEOUS
 -       AUDIO
 -       BONES
 -       BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD
 -       COLD INJURY PROTOCOL

 -       EPILEPSY AND NARCOLEPSY
 -       ESOPHAGUS AND HIATAL HERNIA
 -       EYE EXAMINATION

 -       MUSCLES
 -       NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, MISCELLANEOUS
 -       NOSE, SINUS, LARYNX, AND PHARYNX
 -       PERIPHERAL NERVES
 -       RECTUM AND ANUS
 -       RESPIRATORY (OBSTRUCTIVE, RESTRICTIVE, AND INTERSTITIAL)
 -       RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS
 -       REVIEW EXAMINATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
 -       SCARS
 -       SKIN DISEASES (OTHER THAN SCARS)
 -       SPINE
 -       STOMACH, DUODENUM AND PERITONEAL ADHESIONS
  
 The remaining exam templates will be released by March 2005.  Please note
 that these templates are accessible only through the latest CAPRI GUI,
 DVBA*2.7*66.  This project will not affect the AMIE worksheets.
  
  
 USER ACCESS TO CAPRI
 ====================
 The CAPRI GUI follows all standards for VistA applications.  Users must 
 have a valid VistA user account to access any VistA application.  
 Additionally, in order to gain access to the CAPRI application, and more 
 specifically the CPWM portion of CAPRI, each user will need to be 
 assigned the VistA menu option and security keys outlined below.  
 Please refer to the CAPRI CPWM User Guide for details on the functionality
 controlled by the assigning of the menu option and security keys.
  
 VistA Menu Option
 -----------------
 All CAPRI users need the following menu option assigned as their 
 secondary menu option or as an item on their primary menu.
  
   DVBA CAPRI GUI - This is the option context to the main CAPRI 
   application.  All CAPRI users will need this menu option assigned.
  
 VistA Security Keys
 -------------------
 All CAPRI users that will be accessing the C&P Worksheet Module will need 
 at least two and potentially three security keys assigned.  It is 
 important that the IRM staff coordinate with the C&P clinic to determine 
 what keys each user should receive.  The assigning of keys will affect 
 local procedures.  The majority of users will only need two new keys.  
 The users designated to act as Reviewers will need the additional 
 Reviewer key.
  
 1. DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB - This key makes the C&P Worksheets tab 
    visible inside CAPRI.  All CAPRI users that will be involved in the 
    processing of the C&P templates should get this key.
  
 2. One of the following keys should be assigned to all users assigned the
    previous key.  Before assigning the keys, it is important that the
    functions of these keys be understood as they allow whether or not that
    user has the ability to sign and complete a template.  See the Review
    Functionality section of the User Guide for more details on the
    reviewer processes.  Only ONE of these keys should be assigned due to
    the conflicting functionality supported by each:
  
    a. DVBAB CPWM DISALLOW REVIEW - User does not need and can not have 
       their examination templates reviewed prior to release.  Should only
       be assigned at sites that will not be implementing the reviewer
       process.  This allows the user to directly release their examination
       in AMIE.
    b. DVBAB CPWM OPTIONAL REVIEW - User can choose to either send an 
       examination template for review or sign and release the template 
       themselves.  This key will typically be assigned to a user who needs
       some, but not all, of their examinations reviewed before they're
       released.
    c. DVBAB CPWM REQUIRE REVIEW - User must have all examination templates
       reviewed by a reviewer prior to signing and can not release any 
       examinations until approved by the reviewer.
  
 3. If the site chooses to use the review process (meaning either the 
    OPTIONAL REVIEW or REQUIRE REVIEW key has been assigned to anyone) at 
    least one user must be designated as a Reviewer and be assigned the
    DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER key.  It is expected that if the Reviewer process
    is implemented at a site, that multiple people will be assigned this
    key to cover for cases where the primary reviewer is unavailable.
