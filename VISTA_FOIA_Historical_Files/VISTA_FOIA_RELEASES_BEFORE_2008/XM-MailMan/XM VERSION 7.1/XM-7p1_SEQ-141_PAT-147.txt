 NOIS: MIW-0900-41651
 Test Sites:  Milwaukee, WI
 This patch corrects an error which popped up once HL*1.6*66 was released.
 This patch corrects an error which may occur in the second and subsequent
 usages of SENDMSG^XMXAPI if one of the recipients is the sender of the
 message and the input variable XMINSTR is used, but not newed. 
 The first usage causes XMINSTR("SELF BSKT") to be set to null.  The second
 and subsequent usages fail to send the message because XMINSTR("SELF BSKT")
 may not be null as an input value.  The correction is that MailMan will no
 longer set XMINSTR("SELF BSKT") to null.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*119.

 INSTALLATION:
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*119.
 1.  Users may be on the system during installation of this patch.
 2.  DSM Sites: If any of these routines is mapped, disable mapping for the 
     affected routine(s).  
 3.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.  This loads 
     the patch into a Transport Global on your system.  
 4.  You do not need to stop TaskMan or the background filer.
     Users may be on the system.
  
     HL7 LLP's that use MailMan as the transport protocol should be
     shutdown. Use the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option on the
     Filer and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu
     option to stop these types of LLPs. LLP's using the MailMan
     transport protocol are identified on the SYSTEM LINK MONITOR as
     DEVICE TYPE=MM.
  
     Example SYSTEM LINK MONITOR display is shown below:
