 This patch will assist VA Medical Centers in complying with new
 requirements for reporting VistA procurement information to the Federal
 Procurement Data System (FPDS) at the Austin Automation Center (AAC).
  
 IFCAP users will see significant changes to the Process Purchase Card Menu
 [PRCH PROCESS PC], and the Delivery Orders Menu [PRCH DELIVERY ORDER
 MENU]. The changes are specific to the gathering of information for
 the FPDS report. Users of the menus listed above will see new fields with
 suggested defaults when creating Purchase Orders. The gathering of
 information for the FPDS report will be required for these two types of
 orders.
  
 Among the changes implemented by this patch is the ability of users to 
 create a Purchase Order (PO) for the procurement of services, along with 
 products (items from the IFCAP ITEM MASTER file (#441)). To this effect,
 new Product Service Codes (PSC) and Federal Supply Classification (FSC)
 codes are being added to IFCAP. The Product Service Codes are applicable
 only to services and will not be allowed to be used for products (goods).
  
 IFCAP users will not be allowed to add a Product Service Code to any 
 item whether it is a non-recurring item, or an entry from the ITEM 
 MASTER file (#441). In addition, during the creation of a PO, the
 assignment of Federal Supply Classification codes to items and Product
 Service Codes to services will be enforced.
  
 A new feature introduced by this patch is the creation of an HL7 message
 populated with a summary of the procurement information from a PO. The HL7
 message will be generated and sent out by a background process once the
 PO has received the electronic signature required for its obligation. A
 record of the HL7 message will be kept in the global ^XTMP with a duration
 of 7 days. Sites are advised to ensure that the option 'Clean old Job
 Nodes in XUTL' has been scheduled to run on a regular basis in order to
 keep the global ^XTMP from growing. Also, a mail message will be sent to
 the creator of the PO and the approving official (if required) as a
 receipt of the message sent to the AAC. The message can be used as a
 reference for troubleshooting purposes if a particular PO is reported as
 not received by the AAC. 
  
 ****Users can delete the received mail messages at their convenience.
  
 While the Purchasing Agent menu has been modified to include some 
 additional fields for the FPDS report, no default answers for the new 
 fields have been added. For these users, the reporting of FPDS information
 will depend on the Source Code used during the creation of the PO.
  
 Rationale
 ---------
 The Chief Information Officer for the Office of Acquisition and Materiel
 Management (OA&MM) in Austin has asked Health Systems Design & 
 Development (HSD&D) to develop an automated Individual Contract Action
 Report (ICAR), which can be downloaded from local VistA servers to the
 Austin Automation Center (AAC). This enhancement would provide an
 electronic means of transmitting procurements directly into the Federal
 Procurement Data Center (FPDC).
  
 History
 -------
 The FPDS provides a comprehensive mechanism for assembling, organizing,
 and presenting contract placement data for the Federal Government.
 Federal agencies report data to the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC),
 which collects, processes, and disseminates official statistical data on
 Federal contracting. The OA&MM presently receives contract data from VHA
 facilities to their FPDS server in Austin. Every month, local Contract
 Office staff use the Summary of Contract Action Report (SOCAR) from IFCAP,
 along with custom reports from the Prosthetics module, and manually enter
 the data into the FPDS server. The SOCAR contains a summary of all contract
 actions $25,000 and less. All contract actions greater than $25,000 are
 entered separately into FPDS. New FPDS requirements mandate that federal
 agencies report individual contract actions of $25,000 or less through
 an ICAR. 
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20040414 - FPDS ICAR from VistA
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s): 
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000055475 - Purchase Order Issue
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000055475 - Purchase Order Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 While updating FPDS information, the user gets caught in a loop trying to
 choose a 'Possible Preference Program' code. This occurs with the
 selection of Y1 for the 'Competitive Status'.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When the user selects a 'Competitive Status' of Y1, they may now choose
 the 'Possible Preference Program' code of 'O'.  
  
  
 Documentation Updates:
 ----------------------
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via FTP (using BIN mode).  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
 also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany:             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines:              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City:     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
