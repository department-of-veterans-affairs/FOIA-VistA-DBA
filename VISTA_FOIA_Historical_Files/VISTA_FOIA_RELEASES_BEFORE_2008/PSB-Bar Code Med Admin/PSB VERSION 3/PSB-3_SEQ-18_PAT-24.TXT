Subject: STORE ERROR GENERATED USING DISPLAY ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 A store error is generated when users attempt to execute the Display 
 Order option in Bar Code Medical Administration (BCMA).  When selecting a
 drug for a patient who has extensive pharmacy activity available to
 display, for example a drug which has been renewed over a long period of
 time, the store error is generated because the user's partition runs out
 of memory while attempting to load the information for the report.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 Problem:
 A store error is generated when users attempt to execute the Display 
 Order option in BCMA. When selecting a drug for a patient who has
 extensive pharmacy activity available to display, for example a drug which
 has been renewed over a long period of time, the store error is generated
 because the user's partition runs out of memory while attempting to load
 the information for the report.
  
 Solution:
 This patch will modify the way the Display Order option routine accesses 
 and loads the pharmacy activity. The routine will now access the 
 information which has been loaded into a temporary global, and which
 will be deleted upon completion of the report.
