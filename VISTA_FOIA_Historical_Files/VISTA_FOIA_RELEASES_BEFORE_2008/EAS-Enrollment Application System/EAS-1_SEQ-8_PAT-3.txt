Description: 
============

 This patch is in response to Item #22 in the Rossio Report.  In the area
 of Means Test (MT) Deficiencies, Item #22 required that the Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) identify best practices for means testing and
 acquiring veterans' signatures at the local level and explore the
 promulgation of these best practices throughout the system.  In response
 to the Report, the Enrollment Task Force requested implementation on a
 national basis of local sites' initiatives developed to manage scheduling
 activities for veterans who require the completion of a means test.  This
 patch will provide a national patch release to the Enrollment Application
 Systems (EAS) software of locally implemented software that has been
 converted from Class III to Class I.
  
 Note:  This patch, EAS*1.0*3, along with patches DG*5.3*411, SD*5.3*250
        and PX*1*113 are being released in a single KIDS software 
        distribution.  This patch contains the informational portion of
        EAS*1.0*3 and provides instructions on how to acquire, install, 
        and implement the patch.
  
 This patch introduces the following functionality:
  
 1. Veterans who require a Means Test will not be permitted to schedule
 future appointments until their Means Test status is updated. When an
 attempt is made to enter an appointment for a veteran in this status, an
 alert will display and the appointment action will be cancelled.  This
 will only apply to REGULAR appointment types.  Other appointment types are
 not impacted.
  
 2. Existing REGULAR and RESEARCH appointments will be blocked from being
 either Checked-In or Out until the veteran updates his Means Test status.
   
 3. MT Blocking of appointments will not impact the checking-out of 
 unscheduled Walk-in appointments.  Scheduled appointments where the 
 patient requires a means test update will be blocked from being
 Checked-out for REGULAR and RESEARCH appointment types (See 2 above).
  
 4. Users with the override key may bypass the appointment blocking and
 schedule future appointments.
  
 5. In addition to the appointment blocking, functionality released with
 this patch will provide for the auto-generation of Means Test notification
 letters to veterans at 60 days prior to the veterans MT Anniversary date.
 A follow-up letter will be generated at 30 days if the veteran has not 
 updated their means test information by then.  If the veteran has not
 responded by their MT anniversary date, a final letter is generated
 informing the veteran of the follow-up action which will be pursued by the
 VA.  The facility will also have the option of generating a Report of 
 Contact for follow-up contact with the veteran.
  
 A User and Technical manual is being released with patch.  For more
 detailed information, see the appropriate documents listed in the
 Documentation section below.

 Post Installation:
 ==================
  
 1. Assign the EAS MT AUTO LETTERS MENU as a secondary menu to the
 selected users.  You may also attach it to an existing local menu.
  
 2. Assign the EAS MTOVERRIDE and EAS MTSUPV keys to designated users.
 It's recommended that the EAS MTSUPV key be limited to the enrollment
 coordinator or other designated individual.
  
 3. Add users to the EAS MTLETTERS mail group.  This mail group will 
 receive any status and notifications from the auto means test processing.
  
 4. Download and distribute the User Manual and Technical Manual to users.
  
 5. Edit the final letter section for your primary facility for each of
 the three letters in the EAS MT LETTERS File, #713.3, using the Edit
 Final Section of Letter's [EAS MT LETTERS EDIT] option.  You may also
 enter local information into the Report of Contact form.  See the User
 Manual for specifics on entering this section.  The wording of the 
 Initial section has been specified by the Health Administration Services 
 Office and is not to be modified.  
  
 6. If you are allowing more than one location to print letters, you may
 add additional Final Letter Sections for each location if you desire, or
 you may decide to use the common primary facility entry.  See the 
 User Manual for specifics on entering this section.
  
 7. Setup the parameters for your location through the EAS MT Parameter 
 Entry/Edit option.  See the User Manual for specifics on entering this
 section.  You must specify the PRIMARY PRINT DEVICE, Field #5, if you 
 intend to use the EAS MT LETTERS BG PRINT option as a tasked background 
 job.
  
 8.  Schedule the following tasks if you want the Auto MT Letters to run 
 as a tasked background job: Background print job for EAS MT Letters [EAS 
 MT LETTERS BG PRINT], and Background Search for MT Anniversary Dates [EAS
 MT LETTERS BG SEARCH].  The frequency of the tasked job can be determined 
 locally.  The [EASMT LETTERS BG SEARCH] option should be scheduled to 
 run first, followed by the [EAS MT LETTERS BG PRINT] option.  The print 
 option should be scheduled to run no earlier than 4 hours after the
 scheduled start time of the [EASMT LETTERS BG SEARCH] task to allow ample
 time for the completion of the background search and file update.  You 
 may also decide to run the background search only and run the letters 
 interactively.  Sites may determine the best combination for their set up.
   
 Suggested setups are shown below, but can be determined locally.

 options in the Schedule/Unschedule option, the following settings are 
 suggested:
