 Description:
 ===========
 This patch releases four new NATIONAL reminders and dialogs required for 
 the CPRS Integration: Women's Health project.  These reminders will be 
 placed in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file (#811.8).
 
                VA-WH MAMMOGRAM REVIEW RESULTS
                VA-WH MAMMOGRAM SCREENING
                VA-WH PAP SMEAR REVIEW RESULTS
                VA-WH PAP SMEAR SCREENING
 
 The CPRS/Women's Health Clinical Reminders Project and the Office of 
 Information (OI) Health System Design & Development (HSD&D) Health Data 
 Systems group have developed the Women's Health clinical reminders and 
 dialogs released in this patch, that have been approved by the National 
 Clinical Practice Guideline Council for distribution. 
  
 The goal of the Women's Health Clinical Reminders Project is to develop and 
 nationally distribute clinical reminders that can be used by providers to 
 facilitate management of mammogram and/or pap smears for all female 
 patients.
  
 This patch will release all four reminders and dialogs. To use all four 
 reminders and dialogs, the sites must be using the Women's Health Package. 
 If the site is not using the Women's Health package, then the site will 
 only be able to use the VA-WH MAMMOGRAM SCREENING and the VA-WH PAP SMEAR 
 SCREENING reminders.
 
 The VA-WH MAMMOGRAM REVIEW RESULTS and the VA-WH PAP SMEAR REVIEW RESULTS 
 dialogs use new GUI functionality that is released in CPRS version number 
 24 (OR*3.0*190) and CPRS 25 (OR*3.0*195).
 
 For more information, please refer to the Description and the Technical 
 Description text for the individual reminders.
 
 Bug Fixes
 =========
 When editing a computed finding as a finding item in a reminder term the user 
 will see a prompt for V SUBSCRIPT LIST. This is an internal field and the user 
 should not see this field in the editor. This field is removed from the editor 
 and replaced with the COMPUTED FINDING PARAMETER field.
