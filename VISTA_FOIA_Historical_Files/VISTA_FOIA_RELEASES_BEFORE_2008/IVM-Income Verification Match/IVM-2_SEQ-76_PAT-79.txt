============

  PROJECT OVERVIEW
  ================
  In January 2003, the Registration, Enrollment, and Eligibility Group (REEG)
  released software to support the Geographic Means Test (GMT) initiative. Part
  of that release included address enhancements designed to provide a more
  accurate and cleaner address for use in comparison against a newly instituted
  geographic-based monetary threshold. Specifically, the enhancements allowed
  for the automatic population of city, state, and county based on entry of a
  zip code, automatic update of "recent" address changes throughout VA Medical
  Centers (VAMCs) and the Health Eligibility Center (HEC), and the addition of
  two new files - one for county and one for postal codes.
  
  The Interim Address Enhancements (IAE) project addresses the following
  issues and requirements:
  
  VistA Enrollment/Registration:
       1. Patient Permanent Mailing Address  update 
            a. Allow review and manual accept/reject of patients permanent
               mailing address using IVM Demographic Upload Functionality
               for patients receiving pharmacy mailout prescriptions 
            b. Allow automatic upload of "new" patients permanent mailing
               address to the site(s) if the Bad Address Indicator (BAI) is
               set AND/OR there are no active pharmacy prescriptions AND the
               address being sent is newer than the one on file at the site(s)
            c. Allow automatic upload of "new" patients permanent mailing
               address if the site hasn't taken any action to review and accept
               or reject the address change after 14 days 
            d. Allow city selection for multiple cities per zip code
       2. Reporting on changes to patient's permanent mailing address
            a. Create a report containing changed addresses
            b. Create a report containing the addresses to be auto-uploaded
       3. IVM Demographics Upload Cleanup for address fields
       4. Periodic cleanup of IVM Demographic Upload File for non-address
          fields
       5. Filter the outbound HL7 message from VistA to ignore sending "bad"
          addresses to HEC
  
  Infrastructure and Security Services (ISS):
       1. Add entries for other cities to the USPS Postal Codes File 
       2. Add longitude and latitude values to County File
       3. Provide an API that will return the valid city or cities name(s)
          for a given ZIP Code
       4. Modify MFN~M05 message to include new postal code fields
  
  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
  ======================
  The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
  
       1. Patient Permanent Mailing Address  update 
            a. Allow review and manual accept/reject of patient's permanent
               mailing address for patients receiving pharmacy mailout
               prescriptions using IVM Demographic Upload Functionality
            b. Allow automatic upload of "new" patient's permanent mailing
               address to the site(s) if the Bad Address Indicator (BAI) is
               set AND/OR there are no active pharmacy scripts AND the address
               being sent is newer than the one on file at the facility
            c. Allow automatic upload of "new" patient's permanent mailing
               address if the site hasn't taken any action to review and accept
               or reject the address change after 14 days
       2. A new report containing the addresses to be automatically uploaded
          can be accessed using the IVM ADDR UPDT PENDING REVIEW menu option.
          It is suggested to task this menu option to run nightly to a printer.
       3. A one-time cleanup will be tasked to clean up outdated IVM 
          demographics upload data.
       4. A periodic cleanup of non-address related IVM upload data will delete
          data that has not been manually uploaded after 30 days.  The
          following fields will NOT be auto-deleted: 
              DATE OF BIRTH
              DATE OF DEATH (if one does not exist in the Patient file)
              SEX
       5. A filter has been added to the outbound Z07 messages from VistA to
          prevent sending "bad addresses" to HEC in any of the following
          scenarios:
              > The address contains 'UNKNOWN', 'HOMELESS', or 'ADDRESS'
              > The first two characters of the address are equal to '**'
              > The address is NULL
              > The zip code is NULL
