Subject: OUTPUT FORMATTER CHANGES FOR EDI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch incorporates the following changes affecting EDI 837 
 transmissions:
  
 1.  This patch will allow sites to use the Output Formatter functionality
 for EDI 837 transmission of the facility level ID.  This functionality is
 being provided for those sites that require the use of a different 
 facility level ID when billing for remote sites.    Routines IBCE837,
 IBCE837B and IBCEXTRP are modified to resolve this issue.
  
 The LOCAL OVERRIDE ALLOWED field (#.07) of the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION
 (#364.6) file for entry #184 is set to 'YES' to allow for this
 functionality.  The Site's IRM (or Billing Supervisor) will need to set up 
 the Local 837 form entry with the appropriate Form Field Definition for the 
 CURRENT INS CO PROVIDER NUMBER form field using the Forms Output Utility 
 [IBCE OUTPUT FORMATTER] option.  This option is located within the System 
 Manager's Integrated Billing Menu [IB SITE MGR MENU].
  
 2. The FORMAT CODE field (#1) for entry (IEN #311) in the IB FORM
 FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file has been modified to change an incorrect
 variable name.
  
 3. The FORMAT CODE field (#1) for entry (IEN #183) in the IB FORM FIELD
 CONTENT (#364.7) file has been modified to return an array of data 
 elements for more than one revenue code.  It was reported that service 
 date information was only being returned for the first revenue code.  
 Routine IBCEFG1 has been modified to handle the new data array.
 Refer to NOIS BRX-0802-10952.
  
 4.  The FORMAT CODE DESCRIPTION field (#3) for the Box 24K data element
 (IEN #53) of the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file is being updated to 
 more accurately reflect its usage.
  
 5.  The SHORT DESCRIPTION field (#.1) for entry (IEN #945) in the IB FORM
 SKELETON DEFINITION (#364.6) file is being changed to more accurately 
 reflect its usage.
  
 6. The MAIL MESSAGE (#.04) field of the EDI TRANSMISSION BATCH
 (#364.1) file has been modified to accept the new range of numbers which
 was introduced with the Mailman V8 release.
  
 7. The IB208 error message (IEN #249) of the IB ERROR (#350.8) file has 
 been modified to remove the reference to a specific revenue code 
 numbering sequence. Refer to NOIS MSC-0802-41929. 
  
 8. There was a problem identified in which the TRANSMISSION STATUS (#.03) 
 field for the claim was not being marked as closed in the EDI TRANSMIT
 BILL (#364) file if the electronically transmitted claim was printed at
 the clearinghouse. Updated routines IBCEU0, IBCECSA2 and IBCEST should
 correct this problem.  The post-init routine will update existing entries.
 Refer to NOIS NYH-0702-11967.
  
 Install:
 ========
  
 This patch should be installed after normal working hours.  The Queue Means 
 Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP] job should not be running and
 sites should not be actively transmitting claims (Check field 8.04, HOURS TO
 TRANSMIT, in the IB Site Parameter file, 350.9, for the times set to
 transmit).
  
 If installed during the normal workday it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible
 conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be
 affected.
  
         Billing Supervisor Menu [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR MENU]
         Billing Clerk's Menu [IB BILLING CLERK MENU]
         EDI Menu For Electronic Bills [IBCE 837 EDI MENU] 
  
 Install time - less than 10 minutes.
