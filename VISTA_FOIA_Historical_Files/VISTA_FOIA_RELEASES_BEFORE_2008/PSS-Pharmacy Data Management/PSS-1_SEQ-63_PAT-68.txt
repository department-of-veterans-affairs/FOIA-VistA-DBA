Description: 
============

 PSS*1*68 and OR*3*176 are the first of a total of 6 patches that will 
 comprise the Non-VA Meds (Herbals/OTC) project. These two patches are
 being released together to deliver Phase 1 of this project, which is
 explained in more detail below. Phase 2 will contain the following 4
 patches: PSS*1*69, PSO*7*132, PSJ*5*107 and OR*3*187, which will be
 released at a later time. Once all six patches have been installed,
 they will provide the sites the ability to document herbal supplements,
 over-the-counter (OTC) (non-prescription) medications and other 
 medications, taken by patients but not dispensed by the Department of
 Veterans Affairs (VA). These types of medications are commonly
 referred to as "Non-VA Meds."
   
 Below is a list of functionalities that will be available at your site
 once all 6 patches are installed:
  
   1. Add common herbal and OTC products to the DRUG file (#50) and mark
      them as Non-VA Meds.  
   2. Enhance current Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 software to display 
      a patient's use of Non-VA Meds.
   3. Screen for drug-herbal, herbal-herbal and drug-drug interactions
      and display the results in both Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and 
      Outpatient 
      Pharmacy V. 7.0 applications.  
   4. Display Non-VA Med drugs on the Orders and Meds tabs in CPRS
      (Computerized Patient Record System) GUI v23.
   5. Display of drug interaction information involving Non-VA Med 
      through CPRS.  
  
 Phase 1 of this project only comprises functionality 1 in the list above
 and is delivered by patches PSS*1*68 and OR*3*176. These two patches give
 the sites the ability to add common herbal and OTC products to the DRUG 
 file (#50) and mark them as Non-VA Meds through the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS
 DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option. Furthermore, they also allow the user to mark 
 an existing dispense drug as Non-VA Med. Once a drug is marked as Non-VA 
 Med, a physician using the CPRS GUI v23 application will be able to 
 document the patient's use of the drug by entering a Non-VA Med order for
 the patient. It is critical that the mark/unmarking of drugs for Non-VA
 Meds be performed through the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
 option. Attempts to use Fileman or other more direct methods of edit 
 could introduce inconsistencies to the DRUG file (#50) and the software 
 would not work as designed.
  
 Functionalities 2 through 5 in the list above are part of Phase 2 of this
 project and will be delivered at a later time, when patches PSS*1*69,
 PSO*7*132, PSJ*5*107, and OR*3*187 have been released.
  
 An important part of this patch is the update of the DRUG file (#50). As
 mentioned before, in addition to herbal supplements and Over-the-Counter
 drugs (usually non-prescription drugs), any prescribed medication 
 currently dispensed by the VA could be acquired by the patient from a
 source other than the VA, and therefore, these drugs must also be marked
 as Non-VA Med. In order to reduce the amount of work necessary to mark
 the existing dispense drugs for Non-VA Med use, the following update will
 occur automatically with the installation of this patch: 
  
  EVERY ACTIVE DISPENSE DRUG MARKED FOR OUTPATIENT USE WILL BE MARKED FOR 
  NON-VA MED USE.  
  
 The following menu options have also been modified: 
  
   1. Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] 
  
      If the dispense drug is marked as Non-VA, it will now print "Non-VA 
      Med" in the "APPL PKG USE:" field.  
  
   2. Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] 
      
      If the dispense drug is marked as Non-VA, it will now print "Non-VA
      Med" under "This entry is marked for the following 
      PHARMACY packages:." 
  
   3. Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] 
  
      When editing an orderable item that is marked as Non-VA Med, it will
      now display "This Orderable Item is marked as a Non-VA Med." right
      after the prompt "Orderable Item Name:" is answered.
  
 A new field, NON-VA MED (#8), has been added to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE
 ITEM file (#50.7).

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Users can be on the system at the time of installation. The only
  recommendation for installing this is patch is that none of the 
  following options are being used at the time of installation: 
  
    - Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] 
    - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
      ITEMS] 
    - Orderable Item Management [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM MANAGEMENT]

   Installation will take about 15 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.

        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*68.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
