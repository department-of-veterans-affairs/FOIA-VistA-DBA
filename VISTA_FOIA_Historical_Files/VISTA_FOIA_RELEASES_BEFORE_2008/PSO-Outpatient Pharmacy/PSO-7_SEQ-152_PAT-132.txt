Subject: NON-VA MEDS (HERBAL/OTC) PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 DESCRIPTION
 ===========
 Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
 requires that patients use of OTC medications, Herbal supplements,
 medications prescribed by the VA but purchased by the patient at an
 outside pharmacy, and medications prescribed by providers outside the
 VA be documented in patients' medical records.  These four categories
 of medications will hereafter be referred to as Non-VA Meds. In
 September 2002, a team with members from different applications was 
 put together to come up with a national solution to address this
 requirement. The applications involved in this project are
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Outpatient Pharmacy,
 Pharmacy Data Management, Inpatient Medications and National Drug
 File (NDF).
  
 This is list of functionalities that the CPRS, Outpatient Pharmacy,
 Pharmacy Data Management, Inpatient Medications and NDF patches will
 effect are broken down and listed below.
  
  
  CPRS
  ---- 
   . Provide a way for the physician to document the patient's use of 
     Non-VA Meds through a new order dialog.
  
   . Include Non-VA Meds in the drug-drug interaction and duplicate
     screening process.
  
   . Display Non-VA Meds on the Orders and Meds tabs.
  
  
  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY
  ------------------- 
   Display the patient's use of Non-VA Meds in the following places:
  
        Medication Profile                    [PSO P]
        Complete Orders from OERR             [PSO LMOE FINISH]
        Patient Prescription Processing       [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
        Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT)  [PSO ACTION PROFILE]
        Poly Pharmacy Report                  [PSOPOLY]
       *Non-VA Meds Usage Report              [PSO NON-VA MEDS USAGE REPORT]
  
     * New menu option.
  
   . Include Non-VA Meds in the drug-drug interaction and duplicate 
     screening process.
  
   . Provide the Health Data Summary application with information about
     a Non-VA Med Order.
  
     Obs: Backdoor entry of Non-VA Med orders in the Outpatient Pharmacy
          application will NOT be available.
  
   
  PATIENT DATA MANAGEMENT
  ----------------------- 
   . Add a new Application Package Use value, NON-VA MED, and allow
     entries in the DRUG file (#50) to be marked as such.
  
   . Change menu options that display the APPLICATION PACKAGE USE field
     to include the new value.
   
   . Add the new value in the communication with CPRS to indicate
     whether an Orderable Item is marked as a NON-VA MED or not.
  
  
  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
  ---------------------
   . Include Non-VA Meds in the drug-drug interaction and duplicate 
     screening process.
  
  
  NATIONAL DRUG FILE
  ------------------ 
   . Add common herbal and OTC products to the National Drug File.
  
  
 This patch contains the modifications for the Outpatient Pharmacy
 application listed above. The Outpatient Pharmacy User's Manual, as
 well as the Technical Manual, have been updated to reflect these
 modifications. In addition to these two manuals, you will be able
 to find useful in formation in following documents provided with this
 patch:
  
  The revised Technical Manual and Outpatient Pharmacist's User Manual
  are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following
  Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
  specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
  install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy V 7.0 users are on the system
  or when Outpatient orders are being entered and signed through Computerized
  Patient Record System (CPRS) V 1.0.  Installation will take no longer than
  5 minutes. Suggested time to install: During non-peak requirement hours for
  CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy users.  
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*132) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*132.  
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
     respond NO.  
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
