Subject: USE ADM DATE IN CALC'D LTC COPAY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  When the Calculated Long Term Care (LTC) Copayments Report [EASEC LTC
  COPAY PRINT] is executed, it uses the patient's most recent LTC test to
  calculate the copayments, even though it may not be the test that was in
  effect at the time of the patient's LTC admission.
  
  This patch will modify the report to find the LTC test that was/is in
  effect for the LTC admission date entered for the report.
  
  
  This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
  This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy ticket(s):
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  HD0000000063800 - DAN-0304-40635  LTC Co-Pay test
  
  Overview of NOIS/Remedy Message(s):
  ----------------------------
  Problem:  What was thought to be a problem with new Long Term Care tests
  cancelling bills already in the system was changed to a problem with the
  Calculated LT Copayments Report not using the correct LTC test to
  calculate the patient's copayments.
  
  Resolution:  Change the Calculated LTC Copayments Report to use the LTC
  test that was/is in effect for the patient's LTC admission date, and use
  that test to calculate the copayments.
