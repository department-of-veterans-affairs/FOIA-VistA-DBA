Description:
============

 This patch is a follow-up to the new functionality introduced with the
 release of patch PRC*5.1*79.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD0000000137556 - Can Not Sign On Purchase Order
 2. HD0000000137862 - Purchase Card Issue
 3. HD0000000137877 - Users Timing Out
 4. HD0000000141481 - Purchase Order Prompts
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------- 
 1. HD0000000137556 - Can Not Sign On Purchase Order 
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 When attempting to sign off a purchase order under the Purchasing Agent 
 menu, the user received the message 'Socioeconomic Group (FY89) not 
 defined in Vendor file.' The order was using a General Post Fund (GPF).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified the routines PRCHFPD2 to screen any General Post Fund and stop
 the collection of FPDS information which is not required for orders using
 a GPF.
  
  
 2. HD0000000137862 - Purchase Card Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 While creating a Detailed purchase card order, the user was placed in a 
 loop when the 'ITEM MASTER FILE NO.:' prompt was skipped and an up-arrow 
 was entered at the new prompt 'Enter an Item Type'. The user was only 
 allowed to enter a new line item number and an item master number before 
 being returned to the line item number prompt. This problem only appeared 
 if the user tried to add an item not found in the ITEM MASTER file (#441) 
 in IFCAP.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified the input template for Detailed purchase card orders to clean up 
 the variable that keeps track of the user response for the new prompt 
 Item Type. Since this is new functionality exported by the previous patch 
 PRC*5.1*79, all the input templates involved in the creation of a 
 purchase order will be updated with a similar resolution via this patch.
  
  
 3. HD0000000137877 - Users Timing Out 
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 One site reported that users were allowed to sign off purchase card 
 orders after timing out without completing required fields. The time outs 
 occurred at the new fields introduced for the collection of FPDS data for 
 a new report requested by the Austin Automation Center (AAC).
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------- 
 Modified the routines PRCHNPO1 and PRCHFPDE to perform edit checks on new 
 fields introduced for the collection of FPDS data. If a user times out 
 without filling in required fields, the purchase order will be marked as 
 incomplete and no electronic signature will be allowed until all the 
 required fields have been completed.
  
  
 4. HD0000000141481 - Purchase Order Prompts
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 One site reported that after installation of the patch PRC*5.1*79, the 
 new functionality to add non-recurring items in a purchase order does not 
 work similar to adding items from file #441. When editing a purchase 
 order or creating an amendment, the prompt for 'Item Type' is presented 
 to the user for non-recurring items every time, and the FSC/PSC field 
 value previously entered in the PO is blank.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified the input templates used in the creation of purchase orders and 
 amendments. After installation of this patch the editing or amending of a 
 PO with non-recurring items will not require the user to answer the 
 prompts for Item Type and FSC/PSC if the fields were populated previously.
  
  
 Developer Initiated Issue:
 --------------------------
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The source code of amended orders is not checked to verify whether or not
 they are required to send a report to the Austin Automation Center. By
 design when orders are created and contain source codes 0, 1, 3, and 9, 
 they are excluded from the FPDS report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine PRCHAMYB to check for the presence of node 9, (File 
 #442) and the source code used for any PO that is amended before it is
 flagged for FPDS transmission.
