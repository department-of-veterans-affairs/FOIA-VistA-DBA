Subject: SHOW NESTED PENDING ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch changes the search criteria for retrieving orders to
  include child orders that meet the specified criteria for order
  summary reports and orders viewed on the Orders Tab.  Prior to
  to this patch, a search of pending orders would not show a
  pending child order once its parent order had changed its status.
  This is most evident on Lab orders with schedules such as
  demonstrated in the following example:
  
  URINALYSIS URINE WC QD
  
 Sub Orders:
    a URINALYSIS URINE WC LB #92 05/07/2003 14:14
    p URINALYSIS URINE WC LB #93 05/08/2003 14:13
    p URINALYSIS URINE WC LB #94 05/09/2003 14:13
  
  In this example, one of the child orders is active, which makes
  The parent order active.  A search on the orders tab and the
  Order Summary reports for all pending lab orders is not displaying
  the two pending child orders for this complex order.
  
 TEST PLAN:
 ==========
  To duplicate this problem:
  1) Enter a complex lab order that contains a schedule with more
     one child as the result. 
  2) View this order on the CPRS Orders Tab.
  3) Now go into the lab package and accession the first child order
     for this group.  This will change the status of the child order
     to active, as well as the Parent order.  All other child orders
     will remain pending.
  4) Now go back to CPRS Orders tab and change the view to include
     only pending Lab orders.
  5) None of the orders just entered will be displayed.
  6) Now go to List Manager and ask for a Custom Order Summary for
     this Patient.  Select to only show Pending Labs.  None of the
     orders just entered will be displayed.
  
  Now install the patch.
  
  If you go back and repeat steps 4 and 6, you will now see the pending
  child lab orders displayed.
