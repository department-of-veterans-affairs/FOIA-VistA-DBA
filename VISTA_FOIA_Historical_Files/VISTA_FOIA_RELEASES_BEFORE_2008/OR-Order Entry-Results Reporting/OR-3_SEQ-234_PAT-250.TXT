 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1. HD0000000130830  Can create a lab personal quick order - but then 
    cannot access it.
  
  Problem:
  ========
  Personal Quick Orders created from any CHEMISTY LAB Quick Order are not
  displayed.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The display of LAB Quick Orders RPC was hard coded to only look for 
  the display type of LAB. The RPC routine was modified to include all the 
  display types under the parent display group LAB, this includes the
  following:
  
  LABORATORY
    CHEMISTRY
    HEMATOLOGY
    MICROBIOLOGY
    BLOOD BANK
    ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY
    ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
    SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
    AUTOPSY
    CYTOLOGY
  
 2. HD0000000133644  VITALS^ORQQVI TAG NOT WORKING
  
  Problem:
  ========
  An on site developer using a local call noticed that the routine
  returns the patient vital measurements but was not returning a complete
  list. 
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The routine that searches a temp global returned from GMRVUTO had a 
  typo which left out a node subscript, causing some vitals to be missed. 
  The typo was corrected, allowing a complete search and list of vitals. 
  
 3. HD0000000070022  PUG-0203-51090  Order number truncated in
    notifications
  
  Problem:
  ========
  When using [ORB3 ALERT RECIPIENTS] "Display Patient Alerts and Alert 
  Recipients", the Order # of the order alerted to is displayed. But in 
  the case of some alerts the Order # is being truncated. Making it
  useless, if being used to trouble shoot problems.
  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Due to the limit of characters on a display line in VISTA and length 
  of the Alert title as well as the increasing length of the Order # the 
  number was truncated. The title of the alert "Order(s) needing 
  clarification: Flagged 03/13 18:30" was abbreviated in this display only,
  to: "Order needs clarifying: Flagged 03/13 18:30", to accommodate the 
  limited space. The title is followed by the Order number, which in some 
  sites is going up to 10 characters. The new display line will look 
  like the following:
  
  1   Order needs clarifying: Flagged 03/13 18:30 [12596972] 3/13/06@18:30
