Subject: CAPRI GUI UPDATE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch has been released to announce an update to the
 CAPRI GUI executable.  This new version of CAPRI provides enhancements 
 primarily for VHA in the C&P template functionality.  A few other small 
 changes for VBA are also included.
  
 This version of the GUI should replace all previous versions and should 
 be provided to all administrative and clinical staff who deal with C&P
 exams.  In addition, some VSO's, research, and Blind Rehab (VIST) staff
 also use CAPRI at VHA sites and must be provided the update if they are on
 a previous version.
  
 Patch DVBA*2.7*90 is a required install in VistA prior to deployment of
 this new GUI.
  
 CAPRI CPWM TRAINING
 ===================
 The C&P Worksheet Module (CPWM) is a component of CAPRI that's used
 primarily by clinical staff performing C&P exams.
  
 The Compensation and Pension Examination Program office (CPEP) has 
 created a CAPRI CPWM training website to provide you with information,
 video demonstrations and materials to support your understanding of the
 CAPRI Compensation and Pension templates.  This website can be accessed by
 either a link on the CPEP website, or by navigating there directly via the
 following address:
  
 "http://vaww.cpep.med.va.gov/capri"
  
 This web site will be periodically updated with new information, links and
 other materials to support the use of CAPRI CPWM at your site.  For
 specific issues, the CAPRI team can be reached through an Exchange message
 sent to "VHA OI SDD CAPRI".

 TROUBLE-TICKET OVERVIEW
 =======================
  
 The following VBA and/or VHA trouble tickets have been repaired in this 
 version of the CAPRI GUI:
  
   HD0000000091859 - Print tray cannot be selected on VBA printers
   Reported by Sener, Chuck; Benson, Craig
   Resolution: Duplex printing option was added to the print dialog in CAPRI.
    
  
   HD0000000091797 - Access Violation when using co-signature 
   utility function
   Reported by Graham, Blythe C
   Resolution:  co-signature was accessing a screen object
   that had not yet been instantiated.  The method of pulling the
   object was changed.
  
   HD0000000090775 - Lost form data - "There was a problem starting this
   form and repopulating objects."
   Reported by Rubino, Kimberly
   Resolution: Form saving and reloading has been re-worked to keep a running
   history of saved versions.  The ability to "restore" to a previous
   version was added.
  
   HD0000000064448 - VBA users sometimes receive the message
   "These results do not belong to your office" when printing batch
   C&P results.
   Reported by Chuck Sener
   A new broker call was created to pull across the user's
   division.  Division is also now listed at the bottom right of the main 
   CAPRI window for verification purposes.
  
  
   HD0000000092118 - CAPRI-Remote users are timing out too quickly after
   using the "switch sites" function.
   Reported by Sener, Chuck 
   Resolution:  Switch sites will use the timeout on the central Claims system
   instead of the timeout on the remote system.
  
  
  
 GUI CHANGES
 ===========
 Added a "details" button to memo boxes on CPWM templates.  The button will
 display a larger text entry screen, allowing users more room to enter and
 view their responses.
  
 Added a new utility that provides the ability to remove or add additional
 exam types to a CPWM template while in process.  This new feature can be 
 accessed by clicking the "Options" button located at the bottom of a 
 template and then "Manage Templates".
  
 A "News" feature will appear in the lower right corner of the main CAPRI
 window.  Priority news will be displayed at start-up.  Content is
 controlled by the national CPEP office in Nashville.
  
 Templates can no longer be overlayed on top of an exam in AMIE that's in
 an open state and is in the middle of being transcribed.
  
 Modified the co-signature transfer option to not allow transfer into an 
 exam if there's already data there.  This usually means the note is in 
 the middle of being transcribed.
  
 Using the delete button on the keyboard to delete a template was causing
 a Windows access violation.
  
 Record locking has been implemented.  A C&P exam template can now only be
 opened by one user at a time.
  
 Added a VHA report to view a C&P template list by date completed, status, 
 and provider name.  The report can be found under the FILE | REPORTS
 option.
  
 MY UNSIGNED C&P WORKSHEETS dialog has been udpated to display 1U4N
 (1st letter last name + last 4 of SSN).
  
 Copy template button has been added to the C&P Worksheet tab.
  
 Redundant save has been added to the form save process.  On restart, the
 user will be prompted for a backup version to load if there is a problem
 saving and a form being saved doesn't get stored in VistA.
  
 There is a new tool to restore from a previous form.  It's under 
 "OPTIONS".  Autosave will create a restore point.  If a user feels they 
 have lost data, they can revert to a previous saved version of their 
 template.
  
 The user can create their own restore point with the "save" button.  
 All restore points will be deleted once the form is signed.
  
 Load feature for C&P templates has been fixed.  Some controls weren't
 populating correctly.
  
 Info button in a C&P exam template will list what version of CAPRI
 the form was last saved.
  
 New patient entry now runs a potential match check to eliminate any 
 chance of a duplicate patient entry.  User can cancel or continue after
 display, if any potential matches are found.
  
 Added code to deal with TIU blank character string of "***".  Some
 templates were displaying the message about the document having blanks
 (Joints, for example) when the site had set their string to "***" in TIU.
  
 Faster exam form startup.  Resolved the issue of flickering hourglass
 during firstrun and lastrun script processing.
  
 CAPRI was previously displaying all CPRS alerts, not just C&P-related 
 signature alerts.  The alerts are now filtered to just display 
 C&P-related alerts.
  
 Address edit features have been disabled, per request of VBA.  Instead,
 address changes will be inserted into a new C&P exam request text when one
 is submitted.
  
 Under tools, edit C&P reports for the loaded patient has been added.
 Allows re-opening of released exams so they can be edited and re-printed
 or release of open exams still needing release.  This is tied to the
 following keys (the user will need at least one of these to see the 
 option): DVBA CAPRI EXAM LIST EDIT, DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER, and DVBA C
 SUPERVISOR.
