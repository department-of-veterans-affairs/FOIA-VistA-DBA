Description:
============

  There are three patches to support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation
  Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the
  following order:
                    PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy
                    PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management
                    PSN*4*84       National Drug File
  
  They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to
  implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features. Please
  refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the
  names of the documentation files.
  
  Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail
  for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is
  only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
  directory.  The name of the installation guide 
  PS_OUTPATIENT_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_IG.PDF.
  
                    
  The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to
  ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient
  Pharmacy package V. 7.0 automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs
  Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is
  written to HL7 standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as
  the Baker APS Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to
  HL7 V. 2.3.1 standard using locally developed software.  The automated
  dispensing systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.
  
  This patch includes the following new features:
  1.  Creates an HL7 interface to the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.
  2.  The interface transmits drug data to multiple vendor systems
      utilized by VAMCs whenever the following options are selected:
      A. Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.
      B. Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option.
      C. Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] option.
      D. Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE 
         ITEMS] option.
      E. CMOP Mark/Unmark (Single drug) [PSSXX MARK] option.
      F. Synonym Enter/Edit [PSS SYNONYM EDIT] option.
  
  
  HL7 Interface:
  ==============
  This patch installs the following new HL7 Protocols:
  1. PDM Master File Update [PSS EXT MFU SERVER] protocol.
  2. PDM Master File Update Client [PSS EXT MFU CLIENT] protocol.
  
  This patch installs the following new HL7 Application Parameters:
  1. PSS VISTA
  2. PSS DISPENSE
  
  New Option:
  ===========
  A new option has been added to the PSS MGR menu called Send Entire 
  Drug File to External Interface [PSS MASTER FILE ALL]. This is used to
  send the entire drug file to a dispensing system at first start-up to 
  bring the dispensing system in synch with the National Drug file (#50).
  Each dispensing system will decide if they can receive these messages and
  a parameter setting ENABLE MASTER FILE UPDATE will need to be turned on
  in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) in order for these messages to be sent
  across.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  The Pharmacy Data Management User Manual, as well as the Pharmacy Data
  Management Technical Manual/Security Guide, have been updated to reflect
  these modifications. In addition to these two manuals, the following
  documents have also been revised to reflect the new features provided
  with the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface project:
  
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 Technical Manual/Security Guide, 
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 User Manual, 
         Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Automation Interface Release Notes 
  
   
  All are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the
  following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files need to
  be retrieved in binary format.
   
   Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
   (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
   download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
   available FTP server.
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
   
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
   The documentation distribution includes:
   
                                                                  FORMAT
