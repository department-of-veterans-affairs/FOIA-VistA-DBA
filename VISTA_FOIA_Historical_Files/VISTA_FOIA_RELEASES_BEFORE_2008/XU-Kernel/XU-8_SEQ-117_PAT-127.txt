 List of preceding patches: 118, 121
 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.
 
 
 ========================================================================= 
 Installation:
 
 Users can remain on the system, STOP TASKMAN.
 
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
       
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
       
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          
  4.  Users can remain on the system. 
       STOP TASKMAN, and have submanagers stop, STOP other background filers.
       "DO STOP^ZTMKU"
       
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*127'
                               ==========
                               
         No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                         ==
       
   8.  After installing this patch,
       OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
       DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
       your production account to each manager account:
       
 
 
 ZIS6
 ZISTCPS
 ZISUTL
 ZTLOAD
 ZTLOAD1
 ZTLOAD3
 ZTM
 ZTM0
 ZTM1
 ZTM4
 ZTM5
 ZTM6
 ZTMGRSET
 ZTMKU
 ZTMON
 ZTMON1
 ZTMS
 ZTMS1
 ZTMS2
 ZTMS3
 ZTMS7
       
   9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
       All sites:
       DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
       Select the System
       Patch number to load: 127
                             ===
        
  10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
  
       
  11.  Restart TASKMAN with D RESTART^ZTMB.  DSM sites this may require
       a privileged user.
       
  12.  Add a MAIL GROUP to the bulletin "XUTM PROBLEM DEVICE".
       Schedule the option "XUTM QPROBLEM DEVICE" once a day.
