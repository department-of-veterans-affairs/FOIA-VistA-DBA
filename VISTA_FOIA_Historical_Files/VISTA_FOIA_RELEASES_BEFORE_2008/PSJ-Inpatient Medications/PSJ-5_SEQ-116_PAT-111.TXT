Description:
============

 1. The Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients (IMO) project will
 allow a user the ability to order unit dose medications for outpatients.
 This is accomplished through modifications to Inpatient Medications V.
 5.0, Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V.1.0 and Scheduling V.
 5.3. This patch provides the changes for Inpatient Medications. The detail
 of the functionality changes can be found in the documentation. The
 APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#126) was added to the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS
 file (#53.1).
  
 Two new files have been created in order to support this functionality. 
 The files are the CLINIC STOP DATES file (#53.46) and the CLINIC GROUPS
 file (#57.8). Two new options have been created to allow defining these
 files: Clinic Stop Dates [PSJ CSD] option and Clinic Groups [PSJU ECG] 
 option.
  
 The AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS (#26.8) field has been added to the PHARMACY 
 SYSTEM (#59.7) file with patch PSS*1*59. In order to accommodate this new
 field, the Systems Parameters Edit [PSJ SYS EDIT] option was updated.
  
 ***Important Note*** The IMO functionality will not be available until 
 the patch SD*5.3*285 is released. This patch contains the ability to mark 
 a clinic for use with IMO.
  
 2. Provider Comments are not being saved with active IV orders. This patch
 corrects this by saving Provider Comments when IV orders become active.
 NOIS: ASH-0803-31967, ERI-0303-20187, BOI-0303-50481, ISB-0702-30889. 
  
 3. Drug selection lookup was using an old cross reference.  This patch
 corrects the program to use the correct one. NOIS: ISB-0803-30450
  
 4. To accommodate Billing Awareness, it was necessary to modify the
 communication between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to include
 new diagnosis codes. Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 routes all pharmacy
 orders to the appropriate package. This patch makes the changes necessary
 to pass the new diagnosis codes to the appropriate package.
  
 5. A provider entering an order into Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) V. 1.0 must be permitted to place a limitation on the duration of
 an inpatient medication order. This capability exists for Unit Dose orders
 and Inpatient IV orders, but not for IV Fluid orders. This patch makes
 the change necessary to receive a duration or dosage limit on an IV Fluid
 order placed in CPRS. The limitation will be in hours, days, milliliters,
 or liters. NOIS: HIN-1203-42283
  
 ***IMPORTANT NOTE*** PSI-03-060 "IV Fluid Dialog" has been addressed in 
 CPRS GUI v25 by adding a new field "Duration or Total Volume" to the IV
 dialog per the CPRS Clinical Workgroup recommendation. By using this field
 a user can specify administrative duration or total volume for the IV
 order. This new field when utilized as a duration, however, will override
 the IV Room site parameter LVP'S GOOD FOR HOW MANY DAYS, as well as any
 other time restrictions on Orderable Items.  Additional CPRS Clinical and
 Inpatient Medications Workgroup discussion is necessary to determine a
 resolution to this issue.
  
 6. A site reported a problem with the default start date and time for
 orders created between 11pm and midnight. The default start date for these
 orders may default to 11pm the following day. This patch corrects the
 problem by calculating and displaying the correct default start date and
 time. NOIS: BRX-0803-12080.
  
 7. Two sites reported a problem with IV labels not printing correctly with
 Day-of-Week schedules that had Sunday in the list. This patch corrects
 this problem. NOIS: PHO-0903-60884, MIN-1003-41071 and MIN-0204-41197.
  
 8. A request was made to modify the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU 
 VBW] option to show the clinic for Outpatient IV orders. This patch makes
 this modification. In order to accomplish this, a new cross-reference,
 using the PATIENT NAME field (#.5), CLINIC field (#113) and the
 APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#126), has been added. E3R: 17357
  
 9. A site reported a problem with the display of dosage information 
 under certain circumstances. Specifically, there was no  spacing between 
 the number and the dosage form. This patch works with changes in Pharmacy 
 Data Management V. 1.0 to correct this problem. NOIS: BRX-1004-10173 and 
 SFC-1003-62552
  
 10. To accommodate the Scheduling Encapsulation project, a change has been
 made to the retrieval of appointment information. When a specific error
 code is returned, the following message will display in place of the
 appointment: "Scheduling database is unavailable". NOIS: ISB-0903-31960
  
 11. Orders with Day-of-Week (DOW) schedules may be created with an 
 inappropriate dose frequency which prevents the scheduled doses from 
 appearing on the Virtual Due List (VDL) in Bar Code Medication 
 Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0. A frequency value appropriate for DOW 
 schedules will be stored for orders containing this type of schedule to 
 ensure they display correctly in BCMA. NOIS: HIN-0503-41736
  
 12. Orders created in CPRS V. 1.0 between 2300 and 2400 may, during the 
 finishing process, incorrectly default to a start date and time that is 24
 hours later than the correct default start date and time. Orders created 
 between 2300 and 2400 will now default to the correct start date and time.
 NOIS: PAL-1203-62062.
  
 13. A site reported a problem with scheduled IV orders that have a status
 of expired remaining renewable for up to twenty four hours after the
 expiration date, causing them to incorrectly appearing as missed doses if
 any doses were scheduled between the expiration date and the renewal date.
 Scheduled IV orders that have a status of expired may now be renewed only
 if no doses were scheduled between the expiration date and the renewal
 date. HIN-1204-40563.
  
 14. The Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus Group 
 IRA - Phase III project will prevent users from entering free text
 schedules for inpatient medication orders. This patch helps accomplish
 this by changing the validation of schedules. In Inpatient Medications V. 
 5.0, the SCHEDULE field (#8) of the ORDERABLE ITEM multiple (#2) of the
 UNIT DOSE ORDER SET file (#53.2), has been changed to a pointer, rather
 than a free-text field. The Schedule Practice [PSJU TRAIN SCHEDULE] option
 has been modified to remove references to free-text schedules.
  
 15. The PSJ IWP EDIT input template used in the Inpatient Ward Parameters 
 Edit [PSJ IWP EDIT] option has been modified to include the STAT NOW MAIL 
 GROUP field (#5) in the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6). The new 
 field will be distributed in patch PSJ*5*133.
  
 16. Routine PSJ0111 is executed upon installation of PSJ*5*111. This 
 routine send a copy of the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to the 
 Pharmacy Re-engineering group.

  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 **************************************************************************
  
  PSJ*5*111 contains routines that may overwrite Class III modifications
  for Omnicell, Pyxis and McKesson, among others. 
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 CPRS GUI version 25 consists of three patches. The patches are combined in
 host file OR_3_195_PSJ_PSS.KID in order to simplify installation at
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Installation of this host
 file should be coordinated among the packages affected since only one
 installation is necessary. The patches are:
  
  PSS*1*59       PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT
  PSJ*5*111      INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
  OR*3*195       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
  
 Please see patch OR*3*195 for detailed instructions on the installation 
 steps necessary to retrieve and install this software.
