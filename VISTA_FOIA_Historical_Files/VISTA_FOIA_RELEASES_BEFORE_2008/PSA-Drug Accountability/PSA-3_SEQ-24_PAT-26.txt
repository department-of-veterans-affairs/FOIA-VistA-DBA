Subject: DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY INVOICE UPLOAD REDESIGN

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This enhancement provides a GUI based redesign of the Upload Invoices 
 process used by Drug Accountability V. 3.0.
  
 The UPLOAD UTILITY [PSA GUI UPLOAD] option must be added as a
 secondary menu option for holders of the PSA ORDERS key.
  
 This option is used to upload invoice data from the Prime 
 Vendor and update VISTA Drug Accountability files.  The redesigned 
 function, using GUI instead of ProComm script files will make 
 uploading invoices simpler and faster.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  All Drug Accountability users must be off the system during install.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*26).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3.0*26.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
