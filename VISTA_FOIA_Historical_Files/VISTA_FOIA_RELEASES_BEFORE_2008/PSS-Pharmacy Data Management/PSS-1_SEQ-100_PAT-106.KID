 This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will be 
"BLD",6018,1,2,0)
 used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
"BLD",6018,1,3,0)
 writes to the Pharmacy Data Management file. Since the PHARMACY PATIENT
"BLD",6018,1,4,0)
 file (#55) is being replaced as part of the Pharmacy Re-engineering
"BLD",6018,1,5,0)
 project, any direct M-based global reads or writes to this file must be
"BLD",6018,1,6,0)
 replaced by calling the APIs provided in this patch.
"BLD",6018,1,7,0)
 
"BLD",6018,1,8,0)
 When the new data source is in place, the calling applications will not
"BLD",6018,1,9,0)
 be required to make any changes, because these APIs will be flexible
"BLD",6018,1,10,0)
 enough to retrieve the requested data from the new data source when
"BLD",6018,1,11,0)
 the time comes.
"BLD",6018,1,12,0)
  
"BLD",6018,1,13,0)
 If any application is making direct global reads or writes to this file
"BLD",6018,1,14,0)
 they must be replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.
