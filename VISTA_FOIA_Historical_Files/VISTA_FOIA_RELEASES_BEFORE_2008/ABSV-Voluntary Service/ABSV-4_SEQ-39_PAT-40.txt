Subject: VERSION 3.07 CHANGES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is an informational patch notifying the sites of new and updated
 functionality contained in the V3.07 release of the Voluntary Service System
 (VSS) software.  An addendum to the Voluntary Service System (VSS) User Manual
 is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the IO Field
 Offices.
 
 
 =========================
 NEW/CHANGED FUNCTIONALITY
 =========================
 
 Version 3.07 of the Voluntary Service System software contains enhancements
 for Central Office.  Those enhancements include:
 
 1. Regular Scheduled and Occasional Hours VHA37 Part 1
 Under each organization, list the stations in alphabetical order.  At the
 bottom of the report, include a statement describing how volunteers are
 counted (by unique volunteer, by each combination assignment, etc).  Add
 commas to the numbers to make them easier to read.  If an organization has
 hours posted in the selected date range, include them on the report regardless
 if they are inactive.
 
 2. Regular Scheduled and Occasional Hours VHA37 Part 2
 Under each organization, list the stations in alphabetical order.  At the
 bottom of the report, include a statement describing how volunteers are
 counted (by unique volunteer, by each combination assignment, etc).  Add
 commas to the numbers to make them easier to read.  If an organization has
 hours posted in the selected date range, include them on the report regardless
 if they are inactive.
 
 3. NAC Organizations Yearly Comparison
 At the bottom of the report, include a statement describing how volunteers are
 counted (by unique volunteer, by each combination assignment, etc).  Add
 commas to the numbers to make them easier to read.  If an organization has
 hours posted in the selected date range (five years), include them on the
 report regardless if they are inactive
 
 4. Regular Scheduled and Occasional Hours VS01 Part 1
 On the summary line at the end of the report, add commas to the numbers to
 make it easier to read.  Add the adjusted hours to the report.  Add this
 report to the stations reports section so stations can run the report for
 their individual facility.
 
 Create a button on the user interface that will allow you to print a summary
 only.  If you select to print a summary, a single page report will print
 showing only the totals for selected facility or facilities.  If you do not
 select to print a summary, the current report will print.
 
 5. Regular Scheduled and Occasional Hours VS01 Part 2
 After the Net Gain in the first section, add another smaller section that
 displays the regular scheduled hours, occasional hours, adjustment hours, and
 the total hours.  Display all five fields in the columns across the report.
 
 Add a line for a count of student volunteers in the first section under male
 and female.  This is a count of volunteers aged between 0 and 20.
 
 When the report is printed by VISN, there is no break out of the facilities in
 the VISN, only the addresses and a total for the whole VISN is displayed. 
 VISN directors want to know the status of numbers (data) within their VISN. 
 When the VISN is selected, print a single one page report for each individual
 station in the VISN, followed by a single page with the totals by the entire
 VISN (the totals is currently the only report displayed in the current version
 3.06).  The same breakout applies to State and All Facilities.
 
 Create a button on the user interface that will allow you to print a summary
 only (this is the current report that prints).  If you select to print a
 summary, a single page report will print showing only the totals for selected
 facility or facilities.  If you do not print the summary, you will get one
 page for each facility selected.
 
 6. New Report: VS01 Data View
 Provide the functionality to put the Regular Scheduled and Occasional Hours
 VS01 Part2 into an excel spreadsheet.  This is a new report found under the CO
 Reports menu called VS01 Data View.  The user can select the fiscal year, the
 months, and the data fields to display.  Data fields include: VISN detail
 (name), station detail (name, address, city, state, zip code), count RS on
 rolls, count RS on rolls logging hours, RS hours, occasional hours, adjusted
 hours, and total hours.
 
 7. New Report: Volunteers By Organization Data View
 Create a new report that will list the volunteers by organization in an excel
 spreadsheet format.  Inputs to the new report are: single organization name,
 begin and end date.  Fields required:  organization, first and last name,
 address, total cumulative hours, total hours for the current year, station
 name and number.  Sort by last name for the organization requested.  All
 volunteers who logged at least one hour during the time period for the
 selected organization will appear on the report.
 
 8. Edit Station Name
 Functionality has been added to allow Central Office to edit the name of a
 station. 
 
 9. Add Volunteer Fix
 In Add Volunteer option, when we type and Name and SSN to be added on the
 first page, the system checks if the SSN is not used and lets you add the new
 volunteer. But in case it finds one, then displays you that volunteer's name
 and SSN to choose. After selecting that volunteer from the list, on Add
 Volunteer screen you are allowed to change the First and Last name of the
 volunteer. But in this case, BL and the corresponding stored procedure only
 updates, first name, last name into volunteer table and creates a profile in
 that station for that volunteer. But the problem is that we don't have those
 computed columns anymore that construct volunteers uppercase name, lowercase
 name, display name for report etc etc every time the last name, first name
 changes. That creates a discrepancy in the volunteer's record. And that's how
 we have following record in the Volunteer table.
 
 Lastname: BRUNNER
 Firstname: ANNABELLE
 Middlename: 
 SSN: *** ** ****
 Lowercase name : Canfield, Carole
 Uppercase name: CANFIELD, CAROLE 
 Combination Assignment Fix
 Combination Assignment Fix
 
 There is currently a problem in auto login where incorrect combination
 assignments are displayed for a volunteer.  This has been fixed in version
 3.07.  This is in reference to NOIS: UNY-0404-10590, MIW-0504-40147, and
 DAN-0404-41519.
