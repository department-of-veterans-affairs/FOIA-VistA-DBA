 LETTERS will be modified as follows:
  
  
 NAME: 0-DAY LETTER
 ==================
 According to our records you have not responded to our previous requests
 to complete the financial section of VA Form 10-10EZR, Application for
 Health Benefits.  This is to inform you that your current financial
 assessment (means test) has expired.
  
 How Does This Affect Your Eligibility for Cost Free Care?
   o We do not have a current means test for you on file as is required to
     determine your eligibility for either cost-free care or reduced
     inpatient copayments.
  
 How Does This Affect Your Enrollment?
   o We are unable to determine your priority for enrollment in the VA
     health care system.
  
 What Do You Need To Do?
   o Complete, sign and return a new VA Form 10-10EZR, including the
     financial section.
   o Read the enclosed VA Form 4107VHA, Your Rights to Appeal our Decision.
     If you disagree with our decision, you or your representative may
     complete a Notice of Disagreement and return it to the Enrollment
     Coordinator or Health Benefits Advisor at your local VA health care
     facility.
  
 What If You Have Questions?
  
  
 NAME: 30-DAY LETTER
 ===================
 Each year VA requires most nonservice-connected veterans and 0% service-
 connected veterans to complete a financial assessment (means test).  Our
 records show that your annual means test is due.
  
 As of this date we have not received the updated financial income
 information we requested in a previous letter.
  
 What Does This Mean To You?
   o An updated means test is needed to determine your ability to pay
     copayments for your medical care and medications and your priority for
     enrollment in the VA health care system.
   o Failure to complete the means test by the anniversary date will cause
     your priority for enrollment in the VA health care system to lapse.
  
 What Do You Need To Do?
   o Complete and sign the enclosed Financial Assessment portion of the 
     enclosed VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits Renewal, reporting income
     and assets for the previous calendar year.
   o Return the completed and signed form in the enclosed envelope before
     your means test anniversary date.
   o When you report to your next health care appointment, bring your health
     insurance card so we may update your health insurance information.
   o Notify us if you feel you received this letter in error.
