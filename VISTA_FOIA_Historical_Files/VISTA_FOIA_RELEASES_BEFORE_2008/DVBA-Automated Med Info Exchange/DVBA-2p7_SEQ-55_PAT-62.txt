 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) RIC-1203-20617   Printing hand exams (undefined error)
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Option: DVBA C MEDICAL ADMIN C&P MENU 
            10     C&P Reports Menu ...
            2      Print/Reprint C&P Work Sheets
    
    When selecting the above options, and then printing the report 
    from the HANDS, THUMB, and FINGERS worksheet, an undefinded error 
    occurs. This error is caused by the routine DVBCWHT3, which clears 
    the literal NAME after printing the HANDS, THUMB, and FINGERS exam. 
    After that, any other exams requested to print will fail to print 
    because NAME has been removed (and is needed by each routine printing 
    each individual exam).
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Removed CNUM, SSD, and NAME from the kill command line 20 in routine 
    DVBCWHT3. These three variables are needed by all of the routines that 
    print all of the requested worksheets (exams). DVBCWHT3 was the only 
    routine that cleared CNUM, SSD, and NAME.

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
    
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
     
           Edits and Distribution ...

           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution

          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
    
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*62.
    
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
