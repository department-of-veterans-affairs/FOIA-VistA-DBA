Subject: ACCRUAL (MONTHLY) SV TRANSMISSION DATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the End of Accounting Month Schedule Change (EOAM)
 project. It will modify the date of transmission assigned to the SV code
 sheet that is generated by the Accrual (Monthly) [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL]
 process. It will also modify the option description text for the
 Accrual (Monthly) option that is displayed from the OPTION (#19) file.
  
 After the installation of this patch, the SV code sheet that is generated 
 by the Accrual (Monthly) [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL] option will be transmitted
 to FMS on the same day that it is run, rather than being held until the
 last day of the month.
  
 The new description for the Accrual (Monthly) option in the (#19) file
 will appear as displayed below:
  
    This option will collect IFCAP purchase card orders accrual data.
  
    As part of the End of Accounting Month Schedule Change project the
    scheduling of this option through TaskMan was removed in IFCAP patch
    PRC*5.1*67.
  
    The option must now be run manually and the data transmitted to FMS
    by 8 PM Central Time on the last workday of the month.  Please allow
    enough time for the running of the option in order to assure timely
    submittal of data.
