Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
    Patch ECX*3*21 addresses a number of issues related to reports for
    FY1999 Prosthetics extract data.
       
    Many of the changes needed for the Prosthetics (PRO) Extract were
    distributed in patch ECX*3*15.  This patch provides an update to
    reports generated from the PRO extracts.
    
    (1) The Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit [ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT]
        option is being placed back in service.  Revised report
        generation routines are included in this patch. 
     
        The revised report displays the PRO extract data for the
        period specified by HCPCS code.  The HCPCS code referred
        to here is the code from the PROSTHETIC HCPCS file (#661.1).
        This audit report is intended to be validated against a
        similar report generated by the Prosthetics package which
        also uses the code from file #661.1 to organize data.  
        Please see the Audit Description provided in the Prosthetics
        Extract entry of the EXTRACT DEFINITIONS file (#727.1) for
        further details.
     
    (2) A new option has been created to provide a listing of
        Prosthetics HCPCS items on a fiscal year-to-date basis.
        The new option, Prosthetics (PRO) YTD HCPCS Report [ECX PRO
        YTD REPORT], can be found on the Maintenance menu [ECX
        MAINTENANCE].  Year-to-date HCPCS data will not be sent in a
        MailMan message at the conclusion of each PRO extraction 
        process.
    
        The new year-to-date report will show Prosthetic items 
        listed by HCPCS code.  Please note, the HCPCS code referred
        to here is the code from the CPT file (#81).  This is the 
        code contained in the Feeder Key for the PRO extract record.
     
        The report will include data from each Prosthetic extract since
        the beginning of the fiscal year.  The report may be generated
        for the current fiscal year or for the previous fiscal year.
        (Note: Because FY1999 is the first year for PRO extracts,
        running a report now for the previous fiscal year will show
        no data.)
   
        For multi-divisional Prosthetics sites, the report may be
        generated for the entire facility or for any one division.
        As with other PRO related activities, the user must belong to
        the facility to generate a report for that facility or any
        of its divisions.
   
        The report requires a 132 column print device.  For each 
        HCPCS listed, the following data items are displayed:
     
               Short description of HCPCS code
               Quantity - Commercial sources
               Total cost - Commercial sources
               Average cost - Commercial sources
               Quantity - VA sources
               Total cost - VA sources
               Average cost - VA sources
               Quantity - Prosthetic Lab source
               Total cost - Prosthetic Lab source
               Average cost - Prosthetic Lab source
               Average cost - All sources
     
        The data shown for each line item reflect the cost of
        procuring that item from each source, i.e., commercial,
        VA (non-laboratory), or VAMC Prosthetics laboratory. 
    
        A separate report is generated for New (i.e., initial issue,
        replacement, or spare) and for Repair Prosthetic transactions.
      
        Please Note: Because this report includes data from all PRO
        extracts since the beginning of the fiscal year, it is 
        important that there be only one extract per facility per
        month.  In other words, if it is necessary to repeat the PRO
        extract for a given month, the DSS Site Manager must insure 
        that the original PRO extract for that month is purged. 
        Otherwise, the year-to-date report will contain inflated 
        data.
    
    (3) A new option has been created to provide a listing of
        Prosthetics items produced in on-site Laboratories.  It also 
        displays data by HCPCS code on a fiscal year-to-date basis.
        As in the report described in (2), the HCPCS code referred to
        here is the code from the CPT file (#81).  This is the code
        contained in the Feeder Key for the PRO extract record. 
        The new option, Prosthetics (PRO) YTD Laboratory Report  
        [ECX PRO LAB REPORT], can be found on the Maintenance menu.
     
        The Prosthetics PRO YTD Laboratory Report provides data on
        the entire facility.  Data cannot be reported by a single
        division for a multi-divisional Prosthetics site.
    
        The report requires a 132 column print device.  For each 
        HCPCS listed, the following data items are displayed:
     
               Short description of HCPCS code
               Data for items produced for THIS Station
                   Quantity 
                   Total labor cost
                   Total material cost
                   Average total cost
               Data for items produced for OTHER Stations
                   Quantity 
                   Total labor cost
                   Total material cost
                   Average total cost
   
        Please Note: Because this report includes data from all PRO
        extracts since the beginning of the fiscal year, it is 
        important that there be only one extract per facility per
        month.  In other words, if it is necessary to repeat the PRO
        extract for a given month, the DSS Site Manager must insure 
        that the original PRO extract for that month is purged. 
        Otherwise, this year-to-date report will contain inflated 
        data.
   
    (4) A minor update has been made to the PRO extract routines which
        will allow a new type of Laboratory request form introduced by 
        Prosthetics patch RMPR*3*33 to be recognized.  (It is not neces-
        sary to install RMPR*3*33 in order to install this patch.  The
        PRO extract routines will work properly with or without the
        Prosthetics patch.)
          
    (5) The AUDIT DESCRIPTION field (#10) of the EXTRACT DEFINITIONS
        file (#727.1) for the PROSTHETICS record is being updated.  As
        with all other extracts, this description for the PRO extract
        audit will be printed at the end of each PRO extract audit report
        which is sent to a print device.  It may also be viewed by using
        the FileMan INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES option for file #727.1.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*21):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*21.
    
   6.  If you do not intend to queue the installation to run after normal
       business hours, then answer "NO" to the following prompt:
    
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
    
       If you answer "YES", then the installation will require much more 
       than 2 minutes to run due to the menu rebuild process. 
      
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       Prosthetics Extract               ECXPRO
  
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
   9.  After successful installation, post-installation routine ECX321PT
       may be deleted from the system.
