 Patch XM*7.1*148
  
 NOIS: MON-0800-51277
 Test Site: Montana HCS
 When user backs up on a broadcast message with a response, default to 0,
 instead of 1.
  
 This patch also:
  
 1. Prevents the Postmaster from BRowsing messages in the transmit queues.
  
 2. Improves error tracking during message addressing:
 - If you address a message to a mail group with no members, you will be
 informed that the group has no members.
 - ^TMP("XMERR",$J) for message addressing API errors now contains:
 ^TMP("XMERR",$J,<error #>)=<dialog #>
 ^TMP("XMERR",$J,<error #>,"PARAM","ID")="XMTO"
 ^TMP("XMERR",$J,<error #>,"PARAM","VALUE")=<recipient>
 ^TMP("XMERR",$J,<error #>,"TEXT",<i>)=<line i of error message>
 ^TMP("XMERR",$J,"E",<dialog #>,<error #>)=""
  
 The pre-init with this patch deletes three DIALOG file entries which are
 being replaced with new ones.
  
 NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*133, XM*7.1*134,
 XM*7.1*138, XM*7.1*139, & XM*7.1*146.
