Description: 
============

 Description:
 ===========
  
 I.   This patch contains modifications to the Surgery (SUR) Extract Audit
 report [ECX SUR SOURCE AUDIT] as follows:
  
 1.   The creation of a new section at the end of the report,
 "Cancelled/Aborted Procedures".  Cancelled and aborted surgeries will be
 listed in this section instead of in the O.R. Surgical Procedures or
 Non-O.R. Surgical Procedures sections of the report.
  
 This addresses NOISes MON-0302-51286, BAY-0102-32604 and SDC-0102-61716.
  
 2.   A change to the report logic to exclude type "I" (implant) extract 
 records from the procedure totals.  Type "I" records are not actual 
 procedures and are created in the SUR Extract as separate entries in 
 addition to the primary and secondary procedures.  Totals for each 
 procedure will now more accurately reflect totals in the surgery report  
 Cumulative Report of CPT Codes [SROACC].
  
 This addresses NOIS SDC-0201-61292.
  
  
 II.  Mental Health patch YS*5.01*67 introduced a new selection code, "For 
 ASI-MV", in the CLASS field (#.04) of the ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX file 
 (#604).  This caused an undefined variable error to occur when the Mental
 Health Extract Audit Report [ECX MTL SOURCE AUDIT] was run and this new
 selection code was encountered.  Both routine ECXAMTL and the CLASS FOR
 ASI field (#32) in the MENTAL HEALTH EXTRACT file (#727.812) have been
 modified to accommodate the new selection code.
  
 This addresses NOIS AMA-0502-71021.
  
  
 III. This patch contains a fix for a problem with queuing the QUASAR 
 (ECQ) Extract Audit report [ECX QSR SOURCE AUDIT]. A new variable, ECXPOS,
 introduced by patch ECX*3.0*43 was not being passed when the report is
 queued.
  
 This addresses NOISes: ANN-0602-40084, CTX-0502-72320, BAY-0502-32079.
  
  
 IV.  The option Define Extract Schedule [ECXDEFINE] under the Maintenance 
 submenu [ECX MAINTENANCE] has been placed out of order and disabled from 
 use until various problems which were reported while using this option 
 to run DSS extracts can be resolved.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
     
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with DSS 
  Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been 
  completed.  
      
  No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
  more than once.
      
    1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
        the KIDS distribution included with this message.
       
    2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
        ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
        from the mapped set at this time.
       
    3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation menu.  
       
    4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*44):
   
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
       
    5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*44.
      
    6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
        you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
     
                  ECXMGR       Extract Manager's Options
  
    7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
        to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
