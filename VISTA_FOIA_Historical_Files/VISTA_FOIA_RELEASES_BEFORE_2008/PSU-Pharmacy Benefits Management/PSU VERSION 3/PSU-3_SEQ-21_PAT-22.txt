Subject: MISSING PROVIDER DATA CORRECTION FOR INTERNS AND RESIDENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch makes a correction in the Provider Data summary report, which 
 is generated by selecting item (10) Provider Data, found under the Manual
 Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] option, or which runs during the 
 Automatic Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM AUTO] task job.  Providers who 
 have erroneous missing data will not be included on the Provider summary 
 report.
  
 Problem:  At teaching hospitals, interns and residents are reported as
 having missing subspecialties on the Provider extract summary report.  This
 is incorrect, since by definition interns and residents never have
 subspecialties.  Therefore these should be removed from the report.
  
 Solution:  If any of the following provider classifications are listed as
 missing a subspecialty only, they are omitted from the Provider summary
 report.
  Resident - Allopathic
  Resident - Osteopathic
  Intern   - Allopathic
  Intern   - Osteopathic
