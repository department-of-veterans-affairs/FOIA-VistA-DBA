 Description:
 ===========
  
 A problem with ASISTS Patch OOPS*2.0*12 has been reported in regards to the 
 updated help file (ASISTSHELP.CHM) sent out with the patch. The ASISTS Help 
 was converted from a standard Windows help file (.HLP) to a HTML help file 
 (.CHM) in order to make it compliant with Section 508 requirements and 
 accessible to screen readers.
 
 If you run ASISTS from a network drive and have installed Patch OOPS*2.0*12, 
 when you launch the .CHM help file from within the ASISTS software (either 
 using the F1 key or directly from the Help menu) all the topics contained 
 within the help file will appear blank. This is due to a problem with 
 Microsoft security update 896358 which prevents network applications from 
 properly displaying all .CHM help files. If the .CHM file resides on the 
 local PC, there is not an issue. 
 
 The link below explains how to correct the problem that occurs when opening 
 a .CHM help file on a network drive. The correction involves a registry 
 change that will need to be implemented on each PC that accesses the help 
 files. Your sites group policy can be modified which will immediately 
 correct every PC without any manual intervention. There are several 
 variations of the registry modification and which modification you use 
 will need to be decided by your IRM or Networking staff. Obviously other 
 methods, such as using SMS or a Windows Login batch file could be used to 
 push out the registry modifications. The link below discusses the security 
 update as well as how to correct the problem. The page also contains links 
 to varying articles about group policies.

 Again, which modification you use will need to be decided by your IRM or 
 Networking staff. But as an example, the following fix resolved the ASISTS 
 Help file problem at Fayetteville (Ark) VAMC: 
  
 HtmlHelp.reg 
  
 Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTMLHelp]
 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTMLHelp\1.x\HHRestrictions]
 "MaxAllowedZone"=dword:00000001
 "EnableFrameNavigationInSafeMode"=dword:00000001
  
 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTMLHelp\1.x\ItssRestrictions] 
 "MaxAllowedZone"=dword:00000001
