Subject: TIU Maintenance and Updates

Description:
============

 This patch provides requested updates and outstanding fixes for several 
 different areas of TIU detailed below.
  
 NOIS/E3R:
 ========
 PUG-1101-52116 has been maintained as a high priority enhancement and is 
 addressed, in part, by this patch.  USR*1.0*25 must also be installed to fully 
 satisfy this E3R.  In conjunction with USR*1.0*25, this patch will adjust 
 co-signature requirements so that they will now be determined based on the 
 REFERENCE DATE of the TIU Document instead of the current date.
  
 The following NOIS issues are addressed in this patch:
  
 BED-0201-12253  Question about entering co-signer
 BOI-0204-50865  Error when deleting allergy note
 BRX-1203-11677  TIUPNAPI Error
 DUR-1103-30721  Alerts for d/c summary addenda not firing
 MON-1103-51048  Display of Allergy Object Data
 NOL-0703-70601  Alerts not generated on Addenda for Cosigners
 SDC-0804-61819  Typo in routine TIUALRT
 UNY-0204-10752  No alert for unsigned Addenda
  
 TIUPNAPI has also been modified to add additional functionality to the API 
 detailed in Database Integration Agreement # 1911.  A new parameter has 
 been added so that calling applications that attempt to store their 
 documents that have been electroncially signed outside of TIU can 
 automatically delete their document if the electronic signature fails 
 during creation instead of leaving an UNSIGNED document available to edit.
 Please see DBIA # 1911 for more information.
  
 TIUSRVPT has been modified to prevent the CPRS GUI from filing document 
 text with an invalid document IEN.  This occurrence was discovered by 
 internal GUI testing.  There are no GUI dependancies with this fix.
  
 Data Dictionaries:
 =================
 INPUT TEMPLATE:  TIU ENTER/EDIT PROGRESS NOTE   File #8925
 This input template has been modified to address BED-0201-12253.  Users 
 will be able to jump (via ^ during LM entry) to the Expected Co-signer field
 and make an entry.  This will prevent a "hard error" when the Author/Dictator 
 does not require co-signature.
