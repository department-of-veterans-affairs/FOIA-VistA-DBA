  1) Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search
     NOIS ALB-0699-52558 Undefined variable after patch ONC*2.11*22
     NOIS PUG-0799-50872 Undefined Variable IC(10.8) on Oncology PTF Search
     NOIS NOP-0799-11090 undefined variable(IC(10.4)
  
     SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...
       PT Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search
     
     The Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (PTF)]
     option was aborting with an "undefined variable" error.
     
     This has been fixed.
     
  2) NEW QA REVIEW SHEET
     
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts
         2 Extended 80c
           6 QA-10% Completed Abstracts
     
     A new, shortened version of the QA Review Sheet has been added to
     the "QA-10% Completed Abstracts" report.
     
  3) FOLLOW-UP ATTEMPT NOT ALLOWED
     
     FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...
       FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ...
         AF Attempt a Follow-up
     
     Follow-up attempts were not being allowed for deceased patients.
     
     This restriction has been removed.
     
  4) ABSTRACT WORKSHEET
     
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       WS Edit/print worksheet
 
     a) A new option has been added to the "*..Abstracting/Printing ..."
     menu: "Edit/print worksheet".  This option allows the user to edit
     or print the abstract worksheet.  This functionality has also been
     removed from the "Define Tumor Registry Parameters" option.
 
     b) The abstract worksheet has been updated to reflect all of the
     changes/additions that have occurred in the abstract.  This new
     worksheet will replace the previous worksheet.
     
  5) SEX (160,10)
     
     The use of the FileMan "+" sort qualifier in conjunction with the
     SEX field was causing an "undefined variable" error.  This error
     was due to an unnecessary OUTPUT TRANSFORM.  The OUTPUT TRANSFORM has
     been removed.  In addition, the data type for SEX has been changed
     from a POINTER TO A FILE to a SET OF CODES and the DESCRIPTION has been
     modified.
     
  6) ADD/EDIT FACILITY (160.19) FILE ENTRIES
     
     a) The following entries have been added to the FACILITY file:
     
     520930  MURFREESBORO VA MEDICAL CENTER  MURFREESBORO, TN
     611550  ST CLOUD VA MEDICAL CENTER      ST CLOUD, MN
     
     b) The NAME (160.19,.02) and CITY (160.19,.03) values for FACILITY 
     390003 have been changed:
     
     Old value: GEORGE E WEEMS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL   APALACHICOLA, FL
     New value: WEST PALM BEACH VA MEDICAL CENTER  WEST PALM BEACH, FL
     
  7) CROSS TABS ASCII FORMAT
     
     STA *..Statistical Reports ...
       CI Cross Tabs (ICDO-Site) - Total Registry
       CR Cross Tabs (User Selectable) - Total Registry
       TS Treatment by Stage - Cross tabs
       CT Cross Tab Routines
     
     The following menu has been removed from the above options:
     
     Select one of the following:
     
         1 Tables
         2 Ascii File
         3 Both
     
     Select output:
     
     Choice 1 (Tables) will be automatically selected for the user and 
     choices 2 (Ascii File) and 3 (Both) will no longer be available.
     
  8) 132 COLUMNS CHANGING TO 80 COLUMNS
     
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts
         3 Complete Abstract 132c/QA
           6 QA-10% Completed Abstracts
     
     When printing the "QA-10% Completed Abstracts" report for multiple
     abstracts, the first abstract would print in the correct 132 column
     format but subsequent abstracts would print in the 80 column format.
     
     This has been fixed.
     
  9) NOIS DET-0699-41588 Birthplace Field
  
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       AI Complete Abstract
  
     When adding a new patient to the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (160) file, if the
     patient's PLACE OF BIRTH [STATE] (2,.093) value was "GEORGIA", the
     PLACE OF BIRTH (160,7) field was being incorrectly stuffed with
     "Caucasian Republics of the U.S.S.R."
  
     In the above situation, PLACE OF BIRTH will now be stuffed with
     "Georgia".
  
 In addition to the above, an updated Oncology User Manual (ONC211_UM.PDF)
 and a Technical Manual (ONC211_TM.PDF) have been created and can be
 obtained from the anonymous accounts.
