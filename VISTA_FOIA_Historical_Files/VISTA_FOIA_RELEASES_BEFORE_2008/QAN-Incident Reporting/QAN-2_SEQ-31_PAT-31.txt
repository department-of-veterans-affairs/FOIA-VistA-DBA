 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) PTH-0803-20557  Incident reports not printing
  
        Problem:
        --------
        The error "data set hang up" occurs when printing the Pseudo
        10-2633 Incident Worksheet [QAN INCIDENT WORKSHEET] under
        the Incident Reports Main Menu [QAN INCIDENT REPORTS] option.
  
        Resolution:
        -----------
        The routine QANPSDO uses a "~" as a report heading separator.
        This special character is causing the "data set hang up" error.
        The special character "~" was replaced with the "-" character
        to stop the "data set hang up" error from occurring.
