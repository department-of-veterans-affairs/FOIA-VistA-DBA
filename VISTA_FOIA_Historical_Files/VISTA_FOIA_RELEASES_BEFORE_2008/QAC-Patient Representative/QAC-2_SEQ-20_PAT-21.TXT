Subject: Employee Lookup Bugs in PATS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS) has two remote procedure 
 calls (RPC) that return data from the NEW PERSON file. The RPC names are
 QACV KEY HOLDERS VLH and QACV PERSON LOOKUP VLH. Both RPCs execute the
 same code in routine QACVEMPX. The RPCs return NAME, TITLE and MAIL CODE
 for selected employees.
  
 Problem #1
 ----------
 Currently, if the TITLE or MAIL CODE contain an ampersand character (&), 
 the PATS java code interprets this as a reserved xml character and fails.
 This is experienced in 4 places in PATS.
  
 1. Adding a New Report of Contact (ROC), Cover Sheet tab, the system
 should display a drop-down list of Information Takers. Without the patch,
 the drop-down list of Info Takers is not present.
  
 2. Edit a ROC, search by Information Taker option, should display a 
 drop-down list of Information Takers. Without the patch, the drop-down
 list of Info Takers is not present.
  
 3. Edit a ROC, Resolution tab, adding a new Issue Code, when user tries to
 look up an Employee Involved. Without the patch, the users receive the 
 error: "A problem was encountered while attempting to communicate with 
 VistA. This problem appears to be related with VistALink. Try again. If
 this problem persists contact the support desk for further assistance."
  
 4. Edit a ROC, Notification tab, when user tries to look up an Employee 
 to send a notification. Without the patch, the users receive the 
 error: "A problem was encountered while attempting to communicate with 
 VistA. This problem appears to be related with VistALink. Try again. If
 this problem persists contact the support desk for further assistance."
  
 The fix is to use the Kernel routine $$SYMENC^MXMLUTL in routine QACVEMPX
 to replace reserved xml symbols in the TITLE and MAIL CODE output with
 their coded values.
  
 Problem #2
 ----------
 The NEW PERSON file may contain last names standardized under an old 
 format that removed all punctuation except for hyphens, and last names 
 standardized under a newer format that also leaves spaces and apostrophes 
 in the last name. Thus you may find names like O'BRIEN as well as OBRIEN.
  
 When a user enters O'Brien as a lookup value, PATS was only using the old 
 name standardization, so was only finding matches to the last name 
 OBRIEN, but was not finding O'BRIEN.
  
 This occurs in two different places in PATS.
  
 1. Edit a ROC, Resolution tab, adding a new Issue Code, when user tries to
 look up an Employee Involved.
  
 2. Edit a ROC, Notification tab, when user tries to look up an Employee 
 to send a notification.
  
 After the patch is installed, if a user enters a last name containing
 either an apostrophe or a space, PATS will look for matches to the name
 both with and without the apostrophe or space. Thus, if a user enters
 O'Brien, PATS will find names matching both O'BRIEN and OBRIEN, if there
 are any.
