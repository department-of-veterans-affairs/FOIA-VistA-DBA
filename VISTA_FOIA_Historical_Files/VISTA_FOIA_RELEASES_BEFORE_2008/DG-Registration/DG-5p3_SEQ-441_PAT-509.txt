Subject: CORRECTIONS TO OPT-OUT FUNCTIONALITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  Patch DG*5.3*498 (HIPAA FACILITY DIRECTORY OPT-OUT) distributed changes
  to comply with a patient's request to not be included in the facility
  directory.  Included in these changes were modifications to the Patient
  Inquiry option to reflect the patients facility directory preference
  (i.e. the statement "Patient chose not to be included in the Facility
  Directory for this admission" is printed just above the admission data
  if applicable).  This patch modifies those changes to use the following
  logic:
  
      1) If the patient was never admitted to the hospital, the opt-out
         statement will not be printed
      2) If the patient's last/current admission was a lodger, the
         opt-out statement will not be printed
      3) If an answer to the opt-out question was obtained for the
         last/current admission, the opt-out statement will be printed
         if the patient chose not to be included in the facility directory
      4) If an answer to the opt-out question was never obtained for the
         last admission AND the discharge date is prior to April 14, 2003
         (inclusive), the opt-out statement will not be printed
      5) If an answer to the opt-out question was never obtained for the
         last/current admission AND none of the above conditions are met,
         the opt-out statement WILL be printed
  
  This same logic has also been applied to supported call IN5^VADPT, which
  was modified by patch DG*5.3*498 to return opt-out information for a
  specified movement in sub-nodes of array VAIP(19).

            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*509.

        DG INPATIENT LIST                Inpatient Listing
        DG INPATIENT ROSTER              Inpatient Roster
  
          *NOTE: It has been reported that a 'string too long' error may
                 occur if there are too many users with the Patient Inquiry,
                 [DG PATIENT INQUIRY], option.  Sites may elect to mark this
                 option out of order using the Menu Managment option as

      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
  
  9.  If you are running Vista Imaging, use the menu option to copy the
      routines to the Imaging DICOM gateways as follows: "On the Vista
      server (hospital database), use menu option 'Copy Routines to DICOM
      Gateway' located under the 'Imaging System Manager' Menu.  Then on
      all Text and Image gateways use the 'System Maintenance' menu to
      select Gateway Configuration and DICOM Master File and then select
      'Download Current Radiology and MAS Routines'.  This will cause the
      up-to-date versions of all radiology and MAS routines to be copied
      to the gateway systems."
