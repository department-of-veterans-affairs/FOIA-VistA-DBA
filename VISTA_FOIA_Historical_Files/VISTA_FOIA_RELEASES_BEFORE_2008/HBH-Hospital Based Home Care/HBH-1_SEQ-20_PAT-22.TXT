            Patient Visit Data Report  (80) [HBHCRP3]
            Discharge Data Report by Patient  (80) [HBHCRP5]
            Episode of Care/Length of Stay Report  (80) [HBHCRP12]

            Rejections from HBPC Program Report  (132) [HBHCRP16]
            ICD9 Code/Dx Text by Date Range Report  (80) [HBHCR19A]
            Patient Days of Care by Date Range Report (80) [HBHCRP23]
            Census Reports Menu ... [HBHC CENSUS REPORTS MENU]:
              Program Census Report  (80) [HBHCRP10]
              Address Included Program Census  (132) [HBHCRP25]
              Active Census with ICD9 Code/Text Report  (132) [HBHCRP18]
              Team Census Report  (80) [HBHCRP11]
              Case Manager Census Report  (132) [HBHCRP6]
              Provider Census Report  (132) [HBHCRP9]
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCR19A, HBHCR19B, HBHCRP10,
          HBHCRP11, HBHCRP12, HBHCRP16, HBHCRP18, HBHCRP2, HBHCRP23, 
          HBHCRP3, HBHCRP5, HBHCRP7, HBHCUTL2
  
  
      2)  Prevent PROCESS+5^HBHCRP24 null subscript error in Expanded
          Program Census Report  (80) [HBHCRP24] option, located on
          Census Reports Menu (resolves Remedy ticket: 95103) & also
          omit cancelled visits from report; null subscript error occurs
          when HBHC Admission record exists but no Visits are in HBHC
          Visit file yet
  
          Note: '* No HBPC Visits *' text will appear in the Most Recent
          Visit Date/Time column on the report until after either the
          Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE] or Auto-queue HBHC
          File Update [HBHC AUTO-QUEUED FILE UPDATE] option has run &
          updated the HBHC Visit File (#632). Auto-queue HBHC File Update
          runs automatically overnight on a daily basis & updates visits
          within last 7 days.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP24, option description
          updated with Note above
