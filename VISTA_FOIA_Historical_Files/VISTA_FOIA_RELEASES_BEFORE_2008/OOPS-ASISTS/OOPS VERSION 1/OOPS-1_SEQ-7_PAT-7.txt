Description: 
============

  OOPS*1*7 will include changes to the ASISTS application necessary to
  accommodate multi-facility functionality. The final portion of the ASISTS
  multi-facility function is to provide a mechanism to send mail bulletins
  to the appropriate management and union individuals within a facility, as
  well as those across integrated facilities.
  
  Also included, but not directly related to multi-facility, is a requested
  enhancement to provide default value for various fields within ASISTS and
  NOIS NAS-O200-31284.
  
  Integrated facilities need the ability to send mail bulletins to specific
  mail groups "by facility." To utilize the multi-facility capabilities,
  new facility-specific mail groups need to be created and populated
  appropriately.  The following naming convention should be used: the
  facility's existing mail group name (exactly as it is now defined),
  append a "space," a dash ("-"), another "space," followed by the facility
  number. An example is "OOPS SAFETY<space>-<space>502."
  
  
  The station number recorded in the incident is used to identify the
  facility and for sending mail bulletins to the newly created, facility-
  specific mail group.  If the facility is not integrated, or does not
  require this functionality, the application will work as it currently
  does and no changes will be necessary.
  
  
  This patch addresses the following E3Rs:
  
  12185 - DEFAULT VALUE
  
  When the option, "Edit Report of Incident [OOPS SUP ENTRY] and [OOPS
  SAFETY SUP ENTRY]" is selected, the user is asked to input data for
  fields that are the same from one case to another. The E3R requested
  functionality that will provide default information for these ASISTS
  fields.
  
  In order to have these default values available, two new data files were
  added to ASISTS.  The first is ASISTS SITE PARAMETER FILE (#2262). This
  file will be sent pre-loaded containing one record.  The record within
  this file is "MODIFY TO SITE NAME."   Upon receipt of this patch, each
  site needs to select the option, "ASISTS Edit Site Parameter [OOPS EDIT
  SITE PARAMETER]," which is available from the Safety Officer main menu.
  The existing record must be modified to hold values unique for that
  particular site. The following is an example of this procedure:
  
    Select ASISTS SITE PARAMETER NAME: MODIFY TO SITE NAME  
    SITE NAME...............: MODIFY TO SITE NAME// ALBANY
    OWCP AGENCY CODE........: 
    OWCP DISTRICT OFFICE....: 
    Select STATION: 500

   Are you adding 'ALBANY.VA.GOV' as a new STATION (the 1ST for this ASISTS
   SITE PARAMETER)? No// Y (Yes)

   PHYSICIAN CITY: NEW YORK
   PHYSICIAN STATE: NY  NEW YORK
   PHYSICIAN ZIP CODE: 22162
  
  When the user is in the "Edit Report of Incident [OOPS SUP ENTRY] and
  [OOPS SAFETY SUP ENTRY]" option they will be presented with default
  values for the items listed below. If the default value is not selected,
  the user has the option to type a value into the field.  If the user
  deletes the existing AGENCY NAME or PHYSICIAN NAME, the existing address
  information (address, city, state and zip) for the agency or physician is
  also deleted. When the user exits and then re-enters the case, the
  default values are once again displayed.
  
  1. AGENCY NAME
  2. AGENCY ADDRESS
  3. AGENCY CITY
  4. AGENCY STATE
  5. AGENCY ZIP CODE
  6. STATION NUMBER
  7. PHYSICIAN NAME
  8. PHYSICIAN ADDRESS
  9. PHYSICIAN CITY
  10. PHYSICIAN STATE 
  11. PHYSICIAN ZIP CODE
  
  The second file is the ASISTS DOL DISTRICT OFFFICE FILE (2262.1).  This
  file will be used in not only this project, but in the future project,
  Electronic Submission of CA1/CA2 to DOL.  It is populated with the names
  and codes of District Offices.  It cannot be edited by a user.  Listed
  below are the District Offices available:
  
  
  Name                               Code

  This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s): 
  
  NAS-0200-31284 USER UNABLE TO CREATE ACCIDENT/ILLNESS REPORT
  
  Problem:
  When the option, "Create Accident/Illness Record [OOPS CREATE CASE]" is
  selected, the user enters the requested data and is then kicked out of
  the application without being prompted to save the data that he/she
  entered. If the application could not resolve the identity of the person,
  validation is unsuccessful and the user is unable to create the case.
   
  Resolution:
  Upon installation of this patch, the user has the capability to create
  and save an Accident/Illness record.
