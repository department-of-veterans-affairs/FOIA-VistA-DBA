 *************************************************************************
  
 This Scheduling Application System patch, SD*5.3*495, along with the 
 Hospital Inquiry (HINQ) patch, DVB*4.0*58, and the Patient Care Encounter
 (PCE) patch, PX*1.0*184, is being released in a single KIDS software
 distribution (host file) DVB_4_P58.KID. This patch description includes
 only the Informational portion of SD*5.3*495. Also as part of this
 project are patches PRCA*4.5*250 and IB*2.0*369. These patches must be
 installed before the host file DVB_4_P58.KID.
  
 Please refer to the "Software Retrieval" and "Installation Instructions"
 sections of the DVB*4.0*58 patch description for instructions on how to
 acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch addresses the Automated Service Connected Designation (ASCD)
 project which will automate the Service Connected (SC) decision for
 outpatient encounters using mapped ICD9/Rated Disability Codes at the time
 the clinician enters the ICD9 code for the encounter within the Patient
 Care Encounter (PCE) and Scheduling packages ONLY.
  
 In the current clinical work environment providers are requested to
 designate, at the point of care, if a specific patient care encounter is
 service connected based on available disability rating information. This
 software will computerize the clinician's process at each encounter, i.e.
 mark the encounter service connected (SC) or non-service connected (NSC)
 as appropriate via the PCE & Scheduling packages.  Thus, when a provider
 or clinician chooses the diagnosis code within one of these packages for
 the encounter, the system will automatically determine if the diagnosis is
 related to the veteran's established SC conditions, and will likewise
 automatically make the proper SC/NSC determination.
  
 Additionally, the Class III Service Connection Objective Update Tool
 (SCOUT) software has been converted and implemented as Class I Automated
 Service Connected Designation (ASCD).  This software recognizes
 potentially billable encounters for SC veterans that cannot be
 automatically matched to rated disability codes as well as potentially
 non-billable encounters which were designated NSC but should be SC.  These
 encounters are displayed in reports for coders and/or utilization review
 staff to review the patient visit information and change the incorrect
 SC/NSC designation so they can be billed appropriately.
  
 Patch SD*5.3*495 addresses the following changes/enhancements:
 o  Modifications were made to the outpatient encounter checkout process to
    determine if the encounter needs additional review for final service
    connected designation.
 o  A scheduling API was created to automate and flag checked-out outpatient 
    encounters for review.
 o  The SCOUT application was converted and modified for processing and 
    reporting of encounters that have been set for review.
  
  
  
                    MODIFICATIONS TO OUTPATIENT CHECKOUT
 Technical:
 ----------
 o  Routine SDCOM was modified to call the Scheduling API routine SDSCAPI to
    check if the encounter needs additional review for final service connected
    designation.
 o  A new routine, SDSCAPI, was created to automate and review an encounter
    and determine if the patients rated disabilities match or partially match
    the new RATED DISABILITIES (VA)/ICD9 code mapping.
  
 Functional:
 -----------
 o  During the Check Out process, if the encounter's primary diagnosis code 
    does not match the mapping of the patients rated disabilities and ICD9 
    codes then the encounter will be flagged for review.
 o  The response to the question "Was treatment for SC Condition?" will be 
    automated for each encounter based on the patients rated disabilities and 
    each ICD9 code.
  
  
            Automated Service Connected Designation (ASCD) Application
 Technical:
 ----------
 o  The following new menu options have been created:

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
  
          *********************** WARNING ***********************
  
 Disk space precaution for all sites that are currently running the Class III
 Service Connection Objective Update Tool (SCOUT) software product...
  
 Before installing this patch, please ensure that your production system has
 enough disk space available to easily contain another file of the same size
 as the ANU SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#626140) file you are using with the
 Class III (SCOUT) software.
  
 This patch install will copy the existing records in the ANU SERVICE CONNECTED
 CHANGES (#626140) file and place them in the new SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED 
 CHANGES (#409.48) file.
  
 ****************************************************************************
  
  
 Env/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 * Environment Check Routine (ENV^SD53P495):
  
 Programmer access is required for installing this patch.  Prior to
 installation, the installer must ensure the DUZ(0) node of the DUZ
 array is set to the "@" symbol.
  
  
 * Post-Install Routine (POST^SD53P495):
  
 This routine entry point will determine if your site is running the
 Class III Service Connection Objective Update Tool (SCOUT) software
 which is being replaced by this patch.
  
 If this is true, a file conversion background job will run to file all valid
 Outpatient (O/P) Encounter records from the ANU SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES
 (#626140) file into the SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#409.48) file.
  
  
 * Site Parameter Definition value:
  
 The Post-Install routine (POST1^SD53P495) will create and set the initial
 value for the SDSC SITE PARAMETER to 30 DAYS. 
   
  
 * File and Global Information:
  
 There is one new global, ^SDSC.  The ^SDSC global contains the
 following (1) new file.
                                                             Journaling
 File #   File Name                        Global Root     Recommended
 ------   ------------------------------   -------------   -----------
 409.48   SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES   ^SDSC(409.48,   NO
    
 The estimated growth of the SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES file (#409.48)
 is approximately two to five percent (2-5%) of the monthly total number 
 of records within the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68).
   
   
         ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================

   Patch:  SD*5.3*495 Automated Service Connected Designation
  
   ************
   The existing Class III (SCOUT) file, ANU SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES 
   (#626140), which contains O/P Encounter records that have been compiled
   for additional Service Connected (SC) review, has been used to create a
   new Class I file which will provide the same functionality.
  
   Only valid O/P Encounter records from the Class III (SCOUT) file,
   ANU SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#626140), have been filed into
   the new SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#409.48) file.
  
   The new Automated Service Connected Designation (ASCD) Menu Options
   enable user access to the O/P Encounter records in the (#409.48) file.

 REASON NOT CONVERTED error message explanations:
 ------------------------------------------------
 Three (3) possible error conditions might occur during the file
 conversion processing.  They will be used to report the reason the
 O/P Encounter record was not converted.  The IEN of the encounter
 will be displayed. They are as follows:
  
     #   REASON NOT CONVERTED:
     --  ---------------------
     1)  FILING ERROR TO (#409.48)
     2)  NO O/P ENCOUNTER RECORD (#409.68)
     3)  NO (SCOUT) FILE DATA (#626140)
  
 Each error message is specific to the FileMan FILE that the post-install
 file conversion software could not reference when attempting to file the
 Class III O/P Encounter record into the new Class I file.
  
     - Class I file:    SDSC SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#409.48)
     - Class I file:    OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68)
     - Class III file:  ANU SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#626140)
  
  
 * Please refer to the REASON NOT CONVERTED Error List examples in the
   MailMan message above:
   ----------------------
  
 Note:  When there are records that could not be converted, it will be
        the responsibility of the site to review each error and determine
        if that record needs to be manually entered into the new SDSC
        SERVICE CONNECTED CHANGES (#409.48) file for auditing purposes.
  
  
 Re-Starting or Re-Running the Post-Install process:
 ---------------------------------------------------
  
 The Class III (SCOUT) File Conversion can be run more than one time.
 Only records that have not previously been looked at for converting will
 be processed.
  
 Please restart the post-install process from the following
 programmer's prompt:
                           D POST^SD53P495
  
  
 A new MailMan message will be sent for each new run.  This message will
 contain information from all previously run post-install processing and
 will be displayed as part of the summary processing results.
