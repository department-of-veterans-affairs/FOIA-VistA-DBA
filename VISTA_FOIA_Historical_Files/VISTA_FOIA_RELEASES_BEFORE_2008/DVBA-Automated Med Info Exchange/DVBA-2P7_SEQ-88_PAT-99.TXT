Subject: CAPRI DISCHARGE REPORT NOT WORKING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct problems which cause the CAPRI Discharge
 Report to not print.  Patch DVBA*2.7*59 corrected a similar problem in the
 AMIE version of the report.  In addition, another problem was discovered
 with the date. The data gathering for the report was being started the day
 after the entered starting date.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000093217 - TOMAH VAMC- CAPRI Discharge Report Not Working
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Sites are reporting that they are getting the message "No data found
     for requested report criteria." when attempting to run the CAPRI
     version of the Discharge Summary Report.  While the report does not
     run in CAPRI, it does run correctly in AMIE.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Patch DVBA*2.7*59 corrected a similar problem in the AMIE
         version of the report.  The changes for that patch were
         duplicated in the CAPRI version.
     b)  The data gathering for the report was starting on the day AFTER
         the entered starting date.  This has been corrected.
