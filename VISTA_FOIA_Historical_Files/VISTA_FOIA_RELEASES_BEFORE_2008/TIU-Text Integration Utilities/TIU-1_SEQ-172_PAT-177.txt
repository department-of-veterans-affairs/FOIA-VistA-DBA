 Documentation:
 =============
 Sites will retrieve VistA documentation via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the file from download.vista.med.va.gov.  This transmits the file 
 from the first available FTP server.  Sites may also elect to retrieve 
 the files directly from a specific server as follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
    Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
 
 The updated documentation for the TIU user manual and technical manual
 are tiuum.pdf and tiutm.pdf.
