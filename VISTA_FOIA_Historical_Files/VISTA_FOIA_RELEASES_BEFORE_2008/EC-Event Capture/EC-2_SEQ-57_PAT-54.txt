 PATCH OVERVIEW
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat 
 Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation 
 From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service 
 Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other 
 medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of service 
 connection.
    
 Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed 
 and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this 
 type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the 
 number of product line dependencies.  Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim 
 Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in the 
 Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  It 
 provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for the 
 combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports cross-referenced 
 against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing process.  Phase II 
 of this initiative will involve multiple product lines and additional VistA 
 only development.  The main goals of Phase II will be to fully automate the 
 copayment billing processing of combat vets based on episode of care by 
 providing the appropriate questions at check-out as supplied by CPRS.
    
 Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include 
 Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated Mail 
 Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE), 
 Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF.  The National Patient 
 Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload 
 reporting.  The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
 installed.  It should be noted all patches with the exception of the PIMS
 host file have been previously released and the installation status of
 those patches should be validated at your site prior to installation the
 PIMS build:

 Product Features
 There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
   a.  Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical 
       care
       o  The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those 
          veterans who qualify as such per the directive
       o  The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate 
          audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel, 
          schedulers, etc.)
       o  Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran 
          was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same 
          manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC 
          conditions, etc.
   b.  Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as 
       Combat Related
       o  Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to 
          identify these patients and services provided care for a combat 
          related condition
   c.  Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care, 
       prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose 
       treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless 
       changed by pharmacist.
      
    
 Patch EC*2*54 addresses the addition of a new classification, Combat Veteran,
 to the Event Capture package.  The Roll-n-scroll and GUI application were 
 both updated.
    
 This patch is contained in the MULTIPLE BUILD DISTRIBUTION: COMBAT VET
 PHASE II PIMS 1.0
      
  
 COMBAT VETERAN ADDITION TO ECS
 I. Overview
   
  This patch updates EVENT CAPTURE v2.0 to handle the new classification,
  Combat Veteran.  A 'Yes' or 'No' response will be indicated when a 
  procedure event is related to a Combat Veteran status.  The following
  patches must be installed in order for the Combat Veteran classification
  to function correctly - SD*5.3*325 and PX*1*130.  The options
  that will be affected by this installation are EVENT CAPTURE DATA ENTRY 
  and NIGHTLY DATA FEED TO PCE.
   
   
 II. Functional
  
   If a veteran has reported having been a Combat Veteran, then the Event
   Capture software will ask the user to indicate if the procedure is
   related to Combat Veteran.  The system will prompt the user with 
   'Was treatment related to Combat Veteran?'.  The user can then choose 
   to respond with Y-Yes or N-No.
  
   This change affects all four options of Event Capture roll-n-scroll and
   the two ECS GUI data entry options.
  
     Roll-n-scroll options
       Enter/Edit Patient Procedures
       Batch Enter Data by Patient
       Data Entry (Batch) by Procedure
       Multiple Dates/Multiple Procedures Data Entry
  
     ECS GUI options
       Data Entry by Patient
       Data Entry by Procedure
  
  
 III. Technical
  
   o A new field, COMBAT VETERAN (#40) was added to the EVENT CAPTURE
     PATIENT file (#721) to capture the classification Combat Veteran.
     The data is stored at "P;11" - the 11th piece of the P node.
  
   o The 20th piece of the PCE DATA FEED field (#30) now contains the
     Combat Veteran value.  The Technical description of this field was
     updated to list each piece of data that comprise the PCE data feed.
  
   o Sixteen (16) routines and two (2) input templates were modified. The
     templates EC CREATE PATIENT ENTRY and EC FILE PCE NODE are used
     within ListMan for filing the 'P' and 'PCE' nodes in file 721.
  
   o Delphi ufrmEditPatientProc and urfmEditProcPatients2 were modified
     to add the new classification in ECS GUI.
  
  
 IV. Data Entry Example
  
   o Below is an example of Combat Veteran using the VISTA roll-n-scroll
     ENTER/Edit Patient Procedures option.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 ** It is recommended that this patch NOT be installed less **
 ** than seven days before AmbCare's monthly close-out      **
    
 This patch can be installed with users on the system, however it should
 be installed during off hours to minimize disruption to users.
    
 This patch affects the check-out process and must be installed when the
 SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT background job is not running.  Installation will
 take less than 10 minutes.
  
 Note: The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this multi-package
       distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
       without the prior installation of them.

  1. Download the KIDS file COMBAT_VET_PHASE_II_PIMS.KID from the
     ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake
     OIFO to the appropriate directory on your system.
    
  2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
     enter: COMBAT_VET_PHASE_II_PIMS.KID
  
  3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
  4. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the appropriate patch
     designation - PX*1.0*130, SD*5.3*325, DG*5.3*565, EC*2.0*54):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package COMBAT VET
     PHASE II PIMS 1.0.
  
  7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//',respond NO.
    
  8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
     options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:

                                        Data Event
  
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
   
  10. The pre and post install routines SD53325 and SD53325A can be deleted
      after receiving the message that the SD*5.3*325 post init has run to
