 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 On January 17, 2003, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi 
 announced in the Federal Register that VA will enroll all priority groups 
 of veterans, except those veterans in Priority 8 who were not in an 
 enrolled status on January 17, 2003, or who requested disenrollment on or 
 after that date.
  
 The Enrollment Sub-priorities (ESP) project introduces enhancements to 
 the VistA and HEC Legacy systems to support the Secretary's decision to 
 suspend new enrollments of veterans in Priority 8.  The ESP project 
 consists of two builds: (1) the enhancements to the VistA system are 
 contained in this patch, DG*5.3*491; (2) the enhancements for the HEC 
 Legacy system are being released in patch IVMB*2.0*729. The ESP project 
 enhancements consist of the following:
  
 1. The current logic must be modified to allow a user to set an 
 Enrollment Group Threshold (EGT) that will stop enrollments for a 
 Priority Group without regard to sub-priorities.  This would allow 
 restriction of new enrollments in multiple sub-priorities while leaving 
 enrolled veterans intact. In support of this requirement, a new EGT type, 
 4 - ENROLLMENT DECISION, has been created.
  
 2. The EGT functionality must be modified to prevent a future effective 
 date from replacing the EGT at the sites.  An issue was identified during 
 MEGA Phase I where a future dated EGT setting replaced the existing EGT 
 at the VISTA sites, and new enrollment records could be created based on 
 a null EGT.
  
 3. Enrollment priority sub-categorization to enrollment Priority Groups 7 
 and 8 and all related functional enhancements required to support this 
 re-categorization are being implemented in this patch.  A conversion of 
 existing veterans in enrollment Priority Group 7 or 8 will not be 
 necessary to reflect the new  sub-categorization as all existing patients 
 are currently assigned sub-priority 'a' or 'c'.  The following 
 sub-priorities are being added and removed to meet this requirement:
  
                     -----------------------
                    |   OLD     |    NEW    |
                    |-----------------------|
                    |    a      |     a     |
                    |    b      | <deleted> |
                    |    c      |     c     |
                    |    d      | <deleted> |
                    | <added>   |     e     |
                    | <added>   |     g     |
                     -----------------------
  
 4. The priority algorithm must consider the date of application along 
 with other eligibility factors when determining eligibility for 
 enrollment.
  
 5. An authorized user at HEC must be able to reverse an overridden 
 enrollment record that was enrolled utilizing the EGT SUPERVISOR OVERRIDE 
 menu option.
  
 6. Enrollment letters that were blocked for Priority Group 8 veterans 
 must be re-queued.  This will require the original entry to be removed 
 and a new letter triggered in order to ensure the correct veteran 
 information is used for the letter.  AAC will provide a file and an 
 Enrollment Letter clean-up process must be run after the EGT Effective 
 date.
  
 7. Modifications are needed to the HEC routine, PRI^AYCEPHPD, to resolve 
 an anomaly, related to REJECTED statuses, that was found during technical 
 discovery for this project.
  
 8. Current functionality allows automatic reenrollment of rejected 
 veterans when the EGT level is changed.  This functionality is being 
 changed to prevent automatic reenrollment.
  
 9. The REJECTED; BELOW ENROLLMENT GROUP THRESHOLD enrollment status 
 should be assigned to all records below an EGT setting for a type 4 EGT 
 setting.
  
 10.  Identify and remove the ineligible date from Priority Group 8  
 veterans who applied for enrollment after the enrollment decision (EGT) 
 effective date.  Provide a file of records where the ineligible date was 
 removed.  Provide a file of records where the ineligible date was not 
 removed but the ineligible reason contains the number 8.  Provide a mail 
 message that summarizes the records that were converted.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
  
 1. Modification to the Enrollment Type field (#.04) of the Enrollment 
 Group Threshold file (#27.16) to add the new Type 4 - Enrollment Decision.
  
 2. Modification to the Enrollment Subgroup field (#.12) of the Patient 
 Enrollment file (#27.11) to add the new sub-priorities.
  
 3. Modifications to the algorithm to assign sub-priorities to Priority 
 Group 7 and 8 veterans based on the new business rules for Enrollment 
 Type 4 - Enrollment Decision.
  
 4. Modifications to the API that determines if a veteran is above the 
 Enrollment Group Threshold to include the new business rules for 
 Enrollment Type 4 - Enrollment Decision.
  
 5. Modifications to the algorithm that determines continuous enrollment 
 to use the Enrollment application date.
  
 6. Modifications to the consistency checks done during the upload of 
 enrollment records to include the new sub-priorities.
  
 7. Modifications to the following reports to include the new enrollment 
 type 4:
  
          EGT Preliminary Summary Impact Report
          EGT Preliminary Detailed Impact Report
          EGT Actual Summary Impact Report
          EGT Actual Detailed Impact Report

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
 It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business 
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
    the mapped set at this time.
  
 2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch
     text only].
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
    
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
          (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*491)
    
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
           NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
           will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
           the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
           patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
           in the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      DG*5.3*491.
    
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', respond NO.
  
  7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 1, they should be
