 Subject: Limits on the Use of Certain E-mail Features and Configurations
  
 The intent of the memorandum is to help ensure that sensitive VA 
 information is not put at risk.  This patch puts MailMan in compliance
 with the limits set forth by the memorandum.  The memorandum can be

 ==========================================================================
 Memorandum
 Department of Veterans Affairs
 Date: MAY 24 2004
  
 From: Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology (005)
  
 Subj: Limits on the Use of Certain E-mail Features and Configurations
  
 TO: Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and Other Key Officials
  
 1. To help ensure that sensitive VA information is not put at risk, limits
 must be set on certain e-mail features and configurations. There are
 currently a number of VA systems that allow users to send and receive
 e-mail. These systems include e-mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook and
 Exchange, applications such as the Veterans Health lnformation Systems
 Technology Architecture (VistA), and the Burial Operations Support System.
  
 2. Some of these systems have configuration options that allow e-mail 
 messages to be automatically forwarded from one email address to another.
 Such options are normally used as a convenient way for users to receive
 work-related messages at another location while away from the office.
 Because the forwarding is done automatically, the user loses the ability
 to determine whether a specific message is appropriate for forwarding
 outside VA boundaries and over the Internet.
  
 3. Auto-forwarding of e-mail messages to addressees outside VA may result 
 in information intended for use within the VA network to be transmitted,
 viewed, andlor stored on mail systems outside of VA's control. This is
 clearly unacceptable and puts the Department at risk for Privacy Act or
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations.
  
 4. Effective 30 days from the date of this memorandum, auto-forwarding of 
 e-mail messages to addressees outside the VA network shall be strictly
 prohibited. Autoforwarding of e-mail inside the VA network (e.g.,
 Blackberry) will continue to be authorized. The restriction shall be
 enforced, whenever possible, through software modifications andlor 
 configuration changes at the e-mail gateways. In addition, auditing andlor
 monitoring of e-mail traffic shall be employed to verify compliance with
 this requirement. Once all Enterprise Cyber Security Infrastructure
 Program (ECSIP) gateways are operational and all Internet access has been
 migrated to the four ECSIP gateway locations, the auditing requirement
 will no longer be necessary.
  
 5. Waivers to the auto-forwarding provisions may be requested through the 
 respective facility lnformation Security Officer (ISO). Requests deemed
 appropriate by the facility IS0 will be forwarded for approval through the
 appropriate cyber security chain of command. Waiver requests must include
 documentation indicating why alternatives, such as remote access, cannot
 be implemented or provide the required capabilities.
  
 6. In evaluating such waivers, the IS0 must ensure that all available 
 alternative methods to access e-mail have been sufficiently explored. For
 waiver requests to auto-forward e-mail to appropriate partner agencies
 such as associated hospitals or educational institutions, a copy of the
 HlPAA Business Associate Agreement must be included in the request.
 Waivers to auto-forward e-mail to commercial e-mail providers, such as
 America Online or Hotmail, will require justification of extraordinary
 circumstances to be approved. ISOs will retain waivers on file and
 periodically validate accounts with auto-forward enabled.
  
 7. Some VA e-mail systems allow users to send automatic replies indicating
 that they are unavailable during a particular timeframe (i.e.,
 "out-of-office" notifications). It is important for VA e-mail users to
 remember that these out-of-ofice notifications may be sent outside of the
 VA network to anyone who sends a message to the user's address. Improperly
 constructed out-of-ofice notifications may include sensitive or private VA
 information that should not be shared with outside sources. A well
 constructed out-of-office notification contains the minimum detail
 necessary and should never include information that cannot be disclosed to
 the public.
  
 8. Some VA e-mail distribution lists contain many addresses, including 
 some that are outside the VA network (i.e., "special recipients"). There
 is no obvious indication when a distribution list contains outside
 addresses. If a sender is not careful, sensitive or private information
 may be sent outside the VA network to people who should not receive it, or
 even to inappropriate recipients within the VA network. Senders must 
 examine distribution lists closely to ensure that they contain only
 suitable recipients. In addition, it is important to note that e-mail
 distribution lists may include other e-mail distribution lists (i.e.,
 "nested lists"), and the members of each nested list must also be 
 examined.
  
 9. If there are any questions on this subject, please have a member of 
 your staff contact William Buckingham, Acting Director, Technology and
 Integration Service (005S6), at (202) 273-5071.

 1. There will be no auto-forwarding to non-VA sites.  MailMan will enforce
 this by checking auto-forward addresses each time they are used, and will
 delete any non-compliant ones.  For VA sites, the post-init will populate
 the following new fields in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS (#4.3) file:
 The AUTO-FORWARD LIMITS? (#31) will be set to YES, and ".VA.GOV" will be
 added to the AUTO-FORWARD APPROVED SITE (#31.1) multiple.  VA sites should
 not alter the contents of these fields, or else the site will not be in
 compliance with the memorandum.  Here are the fields:

            DESCRIPTION:      For security or privacy reasons, you may wish
                              to limit the sites to which users may have
                              their mail auto-forwarded.  If so, set this
                              field to YES, and enter the approved sites in
                              the AUTO-FORWARD APPROVED SITE multiple.
  
                              For VA sites, this field must be set to YES.
                              The only approved sites are those ending in
                              ".VA.GOV".
  
                              If this field is set to YES, MailMan will 
                              limit auto-forwarding to only those sites
                              whose names are in (or end in the ones in)

 2. Waivers must be requested through the site's local ISO.  If (and only
 if) a user has a waiver to auto-forward to a non-VA site, the user should
 be assigned the new security key XM AUTO-FORWARD WAIVER, and the waivered
 site should be added to the following new multiple in the MAILMAN SITE

 NAME: XM AUTO-FORWARD WAIVER            PERSON LOOKUP: LOOKUP
   KEEP AT TERMINATE: YES
  DESCRIPTION:   If the AUTO-FORWARD LIMIT? (#31) field is set to YES,
