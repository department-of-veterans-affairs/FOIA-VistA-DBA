 I. DESCRIPTION:
    ============
  
 Patches USR*1*24 and TIU*1*165 both support patch DG*5.3*425, PATIENT 
 RECORD FLAGS. Patches USR*1*24 and TIU*1*165 are sent out together in a
 single distribution.
  
 This patch (USR*1*24) contains routines used to create a new User Class
 and a new Business Rule for Progress Notes used to document the assignment
 of Category I flags to a particular patient.
  
 NOTE:
 The User Class and Business Rule created by this patch apply only to
 Category I flags.  Site use of Category II flags is not mandatory. Sites 
 who choose to create Category II flags must create their own Business 
 Rules for Category II flags.
  
 Sites should not populate the new User Class until staff has been fully
 trained in the assignment, documentation, and use of Patient Record Flags.
 The User Class acts as a safeguard, preventing inadvertent or premature
 entry of such notes.  See DOCUMENTATION, in the SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION
 RETRIEVAL section of patch TIU*1*165, describing where to find
 documentation on how to populate the new User Class, and on other Business
 Rules sites may wish to create or review.
