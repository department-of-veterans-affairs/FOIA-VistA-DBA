 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 UNY-0903-11665         e-IIV overwriting all information
                 
                  
 Overview of Patch Items:
 ------------------------
                  
 1)  Problem:    UNY-0903-11665         e-IIV overwriting all information
     --------
     The Individually Accept method for accepting buffer entries was not 
     initializing and cleaning up the temporary file tracking buffer fields 
     to be individually accepted.  This was causing inappropriate values to 
     be saved to the insurance files.
                      
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The temporary file is initialized and cleaned up between Accept Entry 
     sessions. 
                      
 2)  Problem:
     --------
     A second problem was noticed with a transposition of letters in the 
     user prompt for Insurance Buffer field Name of Insured (355.33, 17). 
                     
     Resolution:
     ----------
     The prompt was corrected.
