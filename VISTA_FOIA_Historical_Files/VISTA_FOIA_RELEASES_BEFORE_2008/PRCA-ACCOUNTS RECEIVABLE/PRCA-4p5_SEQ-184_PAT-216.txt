Subject: E-PAYMENTS PHASE II PREP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch was produced to address two issues relating to EDI Lockbox.  
  
 The first issue is there is a problem with bill number identification
 when an ERA is received.  If the payer identifies the claim by using the 
 format of the 3 digit station number, a space and then the rest of the 
 bill number, VistA cannot find it in the site's A/R file.  The solution 
 is to put a dash in place of the space so the Fileman lookup into the 
 site's A/R will return the correct entry.
  
 The second issue is there is data missing from VistA that will allow 
 for automatic verification of EEOBs (Electronic Explanation of Benefits)
 contained on an ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice).  The criteria to be
 used for verification includes the first 5 characters of the patient's
 last name from the 835 flat file.  We already receive the data in the flat
 file, but do not currently store it for every EEOB.  It is only stored in
 VistA for claims that cannot be automatically found in the site's A/R
 (invalid claims).  This patch will change the logic in VistA to store the
 patient's name  from the 835 flat file in the FREE TEXT PATIENT NAME field
 (#.15) in the subfile ERA DETAIL (#344.41) within the ELECTRONIC
 REMITTANCE ADVICE file (#344.4) for both valid and invalid claims.
