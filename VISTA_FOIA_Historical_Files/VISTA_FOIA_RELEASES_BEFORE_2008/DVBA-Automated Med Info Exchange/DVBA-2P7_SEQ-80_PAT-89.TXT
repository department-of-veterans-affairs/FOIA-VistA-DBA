Subject: CAPRI CPWM TEMPLATE UPDATES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The goal of the CAPRI CPWM project is to implement the current
  Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) C&P exam worksheets
  in an electronic format that will upload exam results into Text
  Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to Computerized
  Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
  CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
  Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*71a.  This CAPRI GUI
  version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
  the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
  exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
  Please refer to patch DVBA*2.7*71 for further information on CAPRI CPWM.
  
  This patch installs 2 new C&P exam templates (marked with an asterisk)
  as well as updates to the other exam templates listed below.
  The templates addressed in this patch are:
  
         AID AND ATTENDANCE OR HOUSEBOUND EXAMINATION
         AUDIO
         EATING DISORDERS (MENTAL DISORDERS)
         GENERAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION
         * GULF WAR GUIDELINES
         INITIAL EVALUATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
         MENTAL DISORDERS (EXCEPT PTSD AND EATING DISORDERS)

  It should take less than 5 minutes to install.
  
  1.  Use the LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION Menu,
      and enter DVBA_27_89.KID

      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*89):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
          NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          the patch is installed.  It compares all components of
          the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that
          are in the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
          the components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package, DVBA*2.7*89
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', respond NO.

      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  9.  (Optional) The routine, DVBA2789, may be deleted after the install.
        
  
  
  User Setup
  ==========
  To activate CPWM for a particular user, the DVBA CAPRI GUI menu option
  and several keys must be assigned:
  
  1.  DVBA CAPRI GUI - This is the option context to the main CAPRI
      application.  All CAPRI users will need this menu option assigned.
  
  2.  DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB - This security key makes the C&P Worksheets
      tab visible inside CAPRI.  All VHA CAPRI users should get this key.
  
  3.  Depending on the local processes established at each site, ONE of the
      following security keys MUST be assigned for anyone who will be
      creating new C&P exam templates with CPWM.
  
      a.  DVBAB CPWM DISALLOW REVIEW - User doesn't need their documents
          reviewed prior to release.
  
      b.  DVBAB CPWM OPTIONAL REVIEW - User can choose to send some
          documents for review and not other documents.
   
      c.  DVBAB CPWM REQUIRE REVIEW - User must have all documents reviewed
          by a reviewer prior to upload.
  
  4.  DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER - If the site chooses to uses the review process
      (by assigning anyone either the OPTIONAL or REQUIRE REVIEW keys), one
      or more users MUST be designated as a reviewer and assigned the DVBAB
      CPWM REVIEWER key.
  
  IRM will need to coordinate with C&P staff to determine what keys a user
  should receive.  The majority of users will need only two new keys (the
  WORKSHEET TAB key and one of the REVIEW keys).  Users designated as
  reviewers will additionally need the CPWM REVIEWER key.
