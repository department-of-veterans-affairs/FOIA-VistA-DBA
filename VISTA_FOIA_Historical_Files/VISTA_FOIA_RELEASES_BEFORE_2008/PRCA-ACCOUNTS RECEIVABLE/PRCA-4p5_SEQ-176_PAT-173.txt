 INTRODUCTION
 ============
  
 The software for this patch, PRCA*4.5*173, and associated 
 patch IB*2*135, are not being distributed through the National Patch
 Module.  These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS software
 distribution (host file).  This patch contains the informational portion
 of PRCA*4.5*173 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to
 acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
 Patch PRCA*4.5*173 contains the Accounts Receivable software 
 changes that support the Third Party EDI Lockbox initiative 
 where third party payers will be sending electronic funds 
 transfers (EFT) to the V.A.'s Lockbox bank in place of paper 
 checks sent to the sites.  The payers will also be sending 
 Explanation of Benefit (EOB) statements electronically as 
 Electronic Remittance Advices (ERA) messages in place of the 
 paper EOBs they currently send to the sites.
  
 The users guide for this patch is currently in development and is going
 through a final review.  Because of the importance of this patch being
 released to meet the HIPAA deadlines, it was decided to release the patch
 software and then deliver the user guide on October 17, 2003.  Since sites
 must be signed up with payers for receipt of electronic Third Party
 Lockbox transmissions, this delay should not cause any undue hardships as
 the document will be available prior to the software actually being able
 to be implemented.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
 ==================
 1.  Electronic ERA and EFT records will be received by VistA 
 via Mailman messages sent from Austin (the Austin FSC sends 
 data through the Austin AAC DMI queues) and are filed into 
 A/R at the site.  EFTs received are automatically posted to 
 FMS using a CR document and are deposited to fund 
 5287/revenue source code 8NZZ.  These ERAs replace paper EOBs 
 and the EFTs replace paper checks.  A new AR EVENT TYPE was 
 added for EDI LOCKBOX.  Two new site parameters were added 
 for default # of days that EFTs and ERAs must age before 
 being included on new EFT and ERA aging reports.
  
 2.  New electronic message exception processing is available 
 to process data records that cannot be filed completely in 
 the A/R system.  Several new mail groups were added to 
 receive bulletins generated as a result of these new messages.
  
 3.  A new Worklist function has been added to allow the data 
 from an ERA to be easily reviewed and passed to the receipt 
 processing option.  Access to many existing options used to 
 research the EOB payments have been included in the Worklist 
 functionality.
  
 4.  Receipt Processing has been changed to allow a receipt to 
 be associated with an EFT and/or an ERA.  The PROCESS RECEIPT 
 action will now perform automatic decrease adjustments if 
 they were entered for any line items on an ERA from within 
 the new Worklist option.
  
 5.  Audit a bill has been re-written to allow for an 
 auto-audit to occur when an electronic bill status message is 
 received by Integrated Billing and it meets the criteria for 
 auto-audit.  The RATE TYPE file was modified to allow entry 
 of a 'BILL RESULTING FROM' field for bills of the 
 corresponding rate type when the auto-audit is performed.  If 
 no data is found in this new field, no auto-audit of bills 
 having that rate type are auto-audited.  A new option exists 
 to set/delete this field to turn auto-audit on and off by 
 rate type.
  
 6.  The ability to transfer the detail for an electronic EOB 
 (EEOB) to another site using Mailman has been added.
  
 7.  A new transaction has been added for FMS.  This is the TR 
 transaction and moves money from the new account set up for 
 EFT deposits to the appropriate fund and revenue source code 
 once a receipt is processed that references the EFT and 
 contains the detail for the payment.
  
 8.  A new separate receipt is now created for each ERA 
 processed through the Worklist.  For those ERAs that 
 reference paper checks, there is a new 215 Summary Report for 
 the Agent Cashier to use to more easily sum up all the 
 receipts for a day's deposit by fund.
  
  
  
      
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
  
 The following is a brief list of the technical functionality 
 and changes contained in this patch.  For specific 
 information on using the software, please refer to the user 
 documentation.
   
 1.  New Server Option
  
     A new server will be added to the option file called EDI 
     Lockbox EFT/ERA/EOB Processing Server [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX
     SERVER].  This option will accept the electronic payment messages and
     electronic remittance advice messages for processing.  Mail messages
     will be delivered to the server and will automatically be filed,
     updating the new Accounts Receivable files for electronic deposit
     records and electronic remittance advice records.
  
  
 2.  New Files
  
     Several new files will be added to Accounts Receivable:
  
     EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT (#344.3)  This file stores data in 
     the ^RCY(344.3 global (note: the RCY global currently exists in the
     Accounts Receivable package). This file will be used to hold the
     electronic funds transfer records of daily deposits received by the
     EDI Lockbox EFT/ERA/EOB Processing Server [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX SERVER].
  
     EDI THIRD PARTY EFT DETAIL (#344.31)  This file stores data in the
     ^RCY(344.31 global.  This file is used to store each individual
     payment from a single payer made to the site using Electronic Funds
     Transfer (EFT) that was included in the site's daily EFT deposit.
  
     ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE (#344.4)  This file stores data in the
     ^RCY(344.4 global. This file holds the ERA (Electronic Remittance
     Advice) information that is received electronically.  It holds the
     summary for each individual EOB (Explanation of Benefits) that
     comprise the ERA.  Individual EOB adjudication detail data is
     automatically stored in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1) file in
     Integrated Billing once the ERA is successfully stored in the
     ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE (#344.4) file in Accounts Receivable.
  
     AR EDI LOCKBOX MESSAGES (#344.5)  This file stores data in the
     ^RCY(344.5 global.  Since the electronic remittance advices may span
     more than one mail message, this file is used as a holding file for
     the data in the ERA mail messages as they are received.  Once all mail
     messages are received for an ERA, the data in the AR EDI LOCKBOX
     MESSAGES File (#344.5) will be moved to the files ELECTRONIC
     REMITTANCE ADVICE (#344.4) and EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1) File.
  
   There will typically be one EFT deposit record received per site per
   business day.  The size and number of the ERA records received by the
   EDI Lockbox EFT/ERA/EOB Processing Server [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX SERVER]
   server option depends on the size of the Medical Center and the number
   of paper payment explanations (EOBs) normally received by the site on a
   given day. Once the server accepts the message, it is removed from the
   server basket for deletion from MailMan.
  
  
 3.  Post-Install Routine
  
     A post installation routine RCY173PO will perform the following
     functions:
  
     a.  Adds default values to the new 'aging' site parameters fields
         in the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file.  The fields updated are
         NUMBER OF DAYS EFT UNMATCHED (#7.02) where the default value is
         set to 5 and NUMBER OF DAYS ERA UNMATCHED (#7.03) where the
         default value is set to 7.  These parameters are used as the
         default number of days to use to include records on the ERA or
         EFT UNMATCHED AGING REPORT.
  
     b.  Adds a new user named 'EDILOCKBOX,AUTOMATIC' to the NEW PERSON
         (#200) file, if it doesn't already exist there.  This is the
         user who will be assigned to the actions performed in the
         background by the EDI Lockbox processes.
  
     c.  Adds a new user named 'PRCA,AUTOAUDIT' to the NEW PERSON
         (#200) file, if it doesn't already exist there.  This is the
         user who will be assigned to the auto-audit function introduced
         by the EDI 3rd Party Lockbox patch.
  
  
 4.  New menus/options:
      
     a.  A new menu option has been added to the Clerk's AR Menu [PRCA
         CLERK MENU] for EDI Lockbox named EDI Lockbox [RCDPE EDI
         LOCKBOX MENU]. This menu contains most of the new options needed
         to perform the functions required to run/manage EDI Lockbox.  
         
     Refer to the user documentation for this patch to see specific details
     on the following options:
           EDI Lockbox 3rd Party Exceptions [RCDPE EXCEPTION PROCESSING]
           Automatic Match EFTs to ERAs [RCDPE MATCH EFT TO ERA]
           Manual Match EFT-ERA [RCDPE MANUAL MATCH EFT-ERA]
           Move ERA Total To Suspense [RCDPE MOVE ERA TO SUSPENSE]
           EDI Lockbox Reports Menu ... [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU]
             Daily Activity Report [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
             EOB Transfer Reports [RCDPE EOB TRANSFER REPORTS]
             EFT Unmatched Aging Report [RCDPE EFT AGING REPORT]
             ERA Aging Report [RCDPE ERA AGING REPORT]
             Unapplied EFT Deposits Report [RCDPE UNAPPLIED EFT DEP REPORT]
             View/Print ERA [RCDPE VIEW/PRINT ERA]
          Unmatch An ERA [RCDPE UNMATCH ERA]
          Update ERA Posted Using Paper EOB [RCDPE ERA POSTED BY PAPER EOB]
          EEOB Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST]
          Mark 0-Balance EFT Matched [RCDPE MARK 0-BAL EFT MATCHED]
           
     b.  An additional menu item was added to the Site Parameter Edit
         [PRCA SITE PARAMETER] menu.  This menu item is used to edit
         the new site parameters for the default 'aging' days for EFTs
         and ERAs.  It is named EDI Lockbox Parameters [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX
         PARAMETERS].
  
     c.  An additional menu item was added to the Agent Cashier's Menu
         [RCDP AGENT CASHIER MENU].  This menu item is used to produce
         a new summary 215 report.  It is named Summary SF215 Report
         [RCDP SUMMARY 215 REPORT].
  
     d.  An additional menu item was added to the Supervisor's AR Menu
         [PRCAF SUPERVISOR MENU].  This menu item is used to activate
         and inactivate rate types for auto-audit.  It is named Update
         Rate Types For Auto-audit [RCDPE RATE TYPE AUTO AUDIT].
  
 5.  New Background Process:
  
     A new background process has been added to the Accounts Receivable
     system to allow for the 'auto-auditing' of bills that were submitted
     electronically via VistA EDI.  The A/R auto-audit functionality will
     be called when Integrated Billing receives return status messages
     indicating the bills have either been electronically forwarded to the
     payer or have been printed and mailed to the payer by the EDI
     clearinghouse.  The auto-audit functionality is controlled by a
     setting in the RATE TYPE file (#399.3) for 'BILL RESULTING FROM'. This
     setting is controlled using a new option on the SUPERVISOR's AR menu.
  
  6.  New fields:
      
     File: AR SITE PARAMETER (#342)
            NUMBER OF DAYS EFT UNMATCHED (#7.02)
            NUMBER OF DAYS ERA UNMATCHED (#7.03)
      
     File: AR BATCH PAYMENT (#344)
            LOCKBOX ACH NUMBER (#.16)
            EFT RECORD (#.17)
            ERA REFERENCE (#.18)
            Subfile: TRANSACTION (#344.01)
                      ERA SEQUENCE (#.27)
                      AUTO DECREASE ADJUSTMENT (#.28)
     File: AR/FMS DOCUMENTS (#347.4)
            TR TYPE (#.07)
  
         This field is released with the following values:
            TRANS TYPE=10  TR TYPE=60
            TRANS TYPE=20  TR TYPE=65
            TRANS TYPE=24  TR TYPE=75
            TRANS TYPE=25  TR TYPE=24
            TRANS TYPE=50  TR TYPE=33
            TRANS TYPE=01  TR TYPE=18
            TRANS TYPE=02  TR TYPE=75
            TRANS TYPE=09  TR TYPE=33
  
 7.  New file entries:
     
     Two new A/R file entries are automatically added by the kids build:
     
     File: AR EVENT TYPE (#341.1)
           NAME: EDI LOCKBOX   EVENT NUMBER: 14   CATEGORY: Payment
     File: AR FMS DOCUMENT TYPE (#347.1)
           NAME: TRANSFER-EDI LOCKBOX DETAIL   ABBREVIATION: TR
  
  
 8.  Modified Input Templates:

     File: AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) Input template: [AR SITE PARAMETER]
     File: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) Input template: [PRCA CAUSED BY]
  
  
 9.  New mail groups:
    
     Four new mail groups are installed by this patch:
  
     RCDPE PAYMENTS: This group will receive all reports and bulletins
     generated by the nightly processing job and from all other EDI
     Lockbox jobs except for those resulting from exceptions found when
     storing the EDI Lockbox transmission records.
  
     RCDPE PAYMENTS EXCEPTIONS: This group will receive all bulletins for
     exception conditions generated by the transmission server option.
  
     RCDPE PAYMENTS MGMT: This group will receive the bulletin that is
     sent when a transferred EOB is accepted by another site.
  
     MLB: This group receives all transmission messages relating to EDI
     Lockbox.  The only member of this mail group is the AR EDI Lockbox
     server option.
  
     A local decision needs to be made to determine who will be members of
     the first 3 mail groups.  Please remember to consult your Accounts
     Receivable staff and add members to these groups upon the completion
     of the patch installation.
  
     The MLB mail group must be populated with the EDI Lockbox server
     option as a remote member after the install has been completed.  This
     remote member name should be:
                   S.RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX SERVER@<site's domain name>
  
 10. New/Modified List Templates:
  
     There are 6 new list templates included with this patch in the RCDPE*
     namespace.
  
     The following list template was modified:
       Receipt Profile [RCDP RECEIPT PROFILE] - bottom margin decreased
           from 17 to 16 to accommodate an additional action item on it's
           protocol menu for EDI Worklist
  
  
 11. New/Modified Protocols:
  
     There are 37 new protocols included with this patch in the RCDPE*
     namespace.
  
     The following protocol was modified:
       Receipt Profile Menu [RCDP RECEIPT PROFILE MENU] - added link to EOB
           Worklist as an action item.
