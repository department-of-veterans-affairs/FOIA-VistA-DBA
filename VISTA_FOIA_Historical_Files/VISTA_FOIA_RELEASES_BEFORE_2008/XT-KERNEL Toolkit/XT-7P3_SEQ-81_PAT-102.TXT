============

  
 1. This patch removes all options, routines and files associated with the 
    following options:
    
  VPM    VAX/ALPHA Capacity Management ...
         Move Host File to Mailman
         Response Time Log Menu ...
    
    These programs within the Kernel Toolkit package no longer function, 
    and they have been replaced with the RUM, SAGG and CM Tools packages.
    
    The following namespace options and routines will be removed:
         XUCM*
         XUCS*
         XURTL*
         [XTCM DISK2MAIL] - option
         XTCMXTCMFILN - routine
    
    The following FileMan compatible files will have both the data 
    dictionary and data deleted:
         Global ^XUCM
         CM SITE PARAMETERS (#8986.095)
         VPM RESPONSE TIME DATA (#8986.098)
         CM SITE NODENAMES (#8986.3)
         CM SITE DISKDRIVES (#8986.35)
         CM METRICS (#8986.4)
         CM DISK DRIVE RAW DATA (#8986.5)
         CM NODENAME RAW DATA (#8986.51)
         CM DAILY STATISTICS (#8986.6)
         
         Global ^%ZRTL
         RESPONSE TIME (#3.091)
         RT DATE_UCI,VOL (#3.092)
         RT RAWDATA (#3.094)
         
    The following non-FileMan compatible global will have it's data 
    deleted:
         ^%ZRTL(3)
         ^%ZRTL("RTH")
    
         *************************************************************
                           NOTE TO SYSTEM MANAGERS
         The globals ^XUCM and %ZRTL may be removed from your database 
         after installation of this patch.  Please make sure no local 
         routines access these globals before doing so.
         ************************************************************* 
    
 The following routines are included in this patch.  The second line of 
 each of these routines now looks like:
  ;;8.0;KERNEL;**[Patch List]**;Jul 10, 1995
  
                  Checksum
 Routine         Old       New      Patch List
 XTPOST            n/a   5200120     **102**
  
 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.
  
 Test Sites: ANCHORAGE
             CONNECTICUT HCS
             LITTLE ROCK
             NORTH FLORIDA/SOUTH GEORGIA
             PUGET SOUND
             TAMPA
  
  
 Installation time will vary according to how much (if any) data is stored 
 in the above listed files.  We anticipate about 20 minutes.  However, if 
 will run much faster if no data is present, and could run slower if there 
 is a large amount of stored data.
  
 An installation example follows:
