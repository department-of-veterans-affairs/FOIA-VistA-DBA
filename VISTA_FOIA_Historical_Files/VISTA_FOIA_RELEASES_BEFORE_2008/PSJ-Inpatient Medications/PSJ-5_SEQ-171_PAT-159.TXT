Subject: UPDATE TO BCMA APIS FOR MED ROUTE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. A site reported a problem with the medication route being blank on the
 Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 Virtual Due List. During
 investigation of possible corrections for this, it was determined that
 another issue needed to be addressed with how to determine when to prompt
 for an injection site.
  
 This patch assists to correct these problems by adding two new items to 
 the Application Programming Interface (API) from Inpatient Medications V. 
 5.0 to BCMA. The NAME field (.01) as well as the PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE IN 
 BCMA field (#8) from the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2) will now be sent
 in the API. HD0000000166204, HD0000000164890, PSI-06-152, PSI-06-158.
  
 2. In support of the BCMA V. 3.0 project BCMA HSC-III, two changes are 
 required to the APIs that supply information to BCMA. First, the flag 
 information for both Unit Dose and IV orders has been added to both the 
 summary and detail APIs. Second, an indicator has been added that will 
 tell BCMA that this order would have triggered a notification to the 
 STAT/NOW mail group.
  
 3. During testing of the BCMA V. 3.0 project BCMA HSC-III, a problem was 
 discovered with the API that determines if an order should trigger a 
 notification to the STAT/NOW mail group. If the parameter which controls 
 the trigger was not defined, all orders would be flagged. This patch 
 corrects this problem. However, it is important to note that if the 
 parameter PRIORITIES FOR ACTIVE NOTIFY is not defined, no order will be 
 flagged as stat for the purposes of BCMA.
  
 4. During testing, a site reported a concern about how an order gets 
 placed on the IVP/IVPB tab in BCMA. This patch assists in addressing this 
 concern by adding the field DSPLY ON IVP/IVPB TAB IN BCMA? field (#9) to
 the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2) to the APIs that supply information to
 BCMA.
