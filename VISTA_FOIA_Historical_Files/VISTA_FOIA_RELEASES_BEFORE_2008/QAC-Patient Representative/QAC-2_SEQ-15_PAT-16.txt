Associated patches: (v)QAC*2*13    <<= must be installed BEFORE `QAC*2*16'

Subject: STATION NUMBER PIECE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch deals with problems entering new contacts.
  
 As reported in TAM-1299-30242,  when entering the "new contact"
 option (QAC NEW) the user occasionally got an undefined error at
 "SITE+8^QACUTL0". While correcting this problem, a change was made
 in the process of creating "Reports of Contact record numbers".  The
 Station Number portion of the number (first three digits) will be created
 using an API in routine ^VASITE.  It is documented and verified the API
 $$SITE^VASITE returns 3 pieces of information with the third piece being
 the Station Number.  Patch QAC*2.0*16 will use this piece as Station
 Number data.
