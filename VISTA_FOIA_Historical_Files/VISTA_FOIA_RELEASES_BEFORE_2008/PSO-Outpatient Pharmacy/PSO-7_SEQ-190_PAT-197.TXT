Description:
============

 **NOTE**
 Since this routine, VEXRX, is not a PSO namespaced routine, it must be 
 retrieved using SHOP,ALL on FORUM.  You do not have to install this 
 routine if you are not currently using the MUMPS AudioFax software to
 retrieve and process Outpatient Pharmacy refill requests.  Patch PSO*7*38
 must be installed prior to installing the new VEXRX routine.
  
  
  
 This patch will modify Process Telephone Refills [A3A PHONE REFILLS] option 
 so the Fill Date prompt will default to Today's date.  Currently when running 
 the option a second time, the Fill Date prompt defaults to the date entered 
 the first time the option was chosen.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 BAC-0804-41653 - (HD68217) Suspense Delayed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During Audiofax Refill processing, if the user enters a future date for 
 the Fill Date, and then goes back into the option to run it again without 
 exiting the menu, the Fill Date will default to what the user entered the
 previous time.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Need to modify this process so the variable that stores the Fill Date is 
 killed after the process finishes.
  
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 BAC-0804-41653 - (HD68217)  Suspense Delayed
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 The variable PSORX("FILL DATE") is not killed at the end of the Audiofax
 Refill process.  Need to kill this variable in routine VEXRX.
