 Patch XM*7.1*198
 
 Test Sites:  Montana HCS; Biloxi, MS
 
 NOIS: none; E3R: none
 
 Patch XM*7.1*51, released May 2001, ensured that every VHA site had
 a ".MED.VA.GOV" synonym in the DOMAIN file.  It also added new names as
 synonyms for sites which requested name changes because of mergers, or
 otherwise, and had name changes approved. 
 
 This patch will complete the 2-step domain name change process begun in
 patch XM*7.1*51. The synonyms will become the new domain names, and the
 old domain names will become the synonyms.  The domain names will be
 changed in the transmission scripts.  The names of the transmission queues
 will be changed.  (These are the Postmaster's baskets where the messages
 waiting to be transmitted are kept.)  And finally, the domain name of the
 site will be changed, too, if it is one of the sites which requested it. 
 
 This will all happen automatically, during the post-init.  It should take
 less than 5 minutes.  You will be instructed to review the install file print
 to check for and correct any errors after the patch has been installed. 
 
 The domain name changes will not adversely affect the flow of mail.
 
 This patch will also begin the 2-step domain name change process for the
 next round of domain name changes.  It will add as synonyms the desired
 new names for sites which requested it.  A future patch will complete the
 domain name change process, once all sites have installed this patch.
 
 Please note that the names of FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV and FORUM.VA.GOV are NOT
 being changed.  They will stay as they are.
 
 NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*51.

 Review the automatic synonym additions which occurred during the PRE-INIT.
 If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
 have its new name added as a synonym.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
 and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and add
 the synonym manually.  Remember, you are not to change any domain name.
 Just add the new name as a synonym. 
 
 Review the automatic domain name changes which occurred during the POST-INIT.
 If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
 have its name changed.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
 and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and
 perform the name change manually.
