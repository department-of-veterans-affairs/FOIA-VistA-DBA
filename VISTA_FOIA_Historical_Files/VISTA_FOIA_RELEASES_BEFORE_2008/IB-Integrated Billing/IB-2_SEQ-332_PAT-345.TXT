Description:
============

 This patch updates the Integrated Billing (IB) application to provide 
 Additional Source of Information (SOI) Codes, as well as, several items 
 related to the electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) functionality 
 that were identified as problems or concerns. 
   
   
 Overview of Patch Items: 
 ------------------------ 
   
 1) Additional Source of Information (SOI) Codes. 
 ------------------------------------------------ 
 Currently, the SOI codes are defined in VistA Data Dictionaries as a 
 Set-of-Codes data type. For national reporting roll-up, the existing 
 SOI Field definition has been changed to a pointer and a new SOURCE OF 
 INFORMATION (#355.12) file has been created. The new file contains the 
 original five SOI codes and four new ones. New codes include: HMS 
 (services from HMS used to identify third party ins), MEDICARE (Medicare
 eligibility extract), ICB CARD READER (insurance entered via 
 DSS insurance card scanner) and CONTRACT SERVICES (insurance entered 
 via temporary clerks or other contracted services). 
   
   
 2) Modifications to and renaming of the Pre-Registration Report. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 The existing Pre-Registration report has been modified to remove the 
 hard coding and allow the user to select any or all of the CODEs (#.01) 
 of the SOURCE OF INFORMATION (#355.12) file for reporting purposes. This 
 report has been renamed to SOURCE OF INFORMATION REPORT [IB OUTPUT PRE-REG 
 SOURCE REPT]. 
   
   
 3) Missing Patient Name. (HD64597)
 --------------------------------
 Prior to this patch some eIV HL7 message responses processed in VistA 
 created a buffer entry without the patient's name. This is due to VMS 
 level HL7 processing and additional audit checks performed on sensitive 
 patients.  Modifications have been made to Integrated Billing (IB) 
 routines to check for these errors and be corrected at the time the 
 buffer entry is created from the IIV RESPONSE (#365) file. 
   
   
 4) Reduce Number of Blank Inquiries via Remote Query. 
 ----------------------------------------------------- 
 An excess number of blank inquiries are created by the current eIV 
 software. Before submitting blank requests, the system needs to check 
 if the patient travels to other VAMCs via the Remote Query utility. 
 If the patient never travels to other VAMCs, then blank inquiries will 
 not be created to check for other insurance from the cache. 
   
   
 5) Populate Patient Insurance File with patient's SSN & DOB. (HD136134)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 VistA will auto populate the INSURED'S SSN (#3.05) and INSURED'S DOB 
 (#3.01) fields in the INSURANCE TYPE (#2.312) subfile of the PATIENT 
 (#2) file with the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) and DATE OF BIRTH (#.03) 
 from the PATIENT (#2) file when a buffer entry is accepted. This only 
 occurs when the patient's WHOSE INSURANCE (#6) in the PATIENT INSURANCE 
 (#2.312) subfile of the PATIENT (#2) file is the veteran with the SOCIAL 
 SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) and DATE OF BIRTH (#.03) from the PATIENT (#2) file. 
   
   
 6) Replace the Payer ID with the Payer Name in the buffer entry. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Currently, the Payer ID (i.e. 'VA1') is displayed instead of the actual 
 full name of the Payer in the expanded buffer entry of a detailed eIV 
 Response. The full name of the Payer will now be displayed. This is a 
 cosmetic change that will greatly improve information to the user. 
   
   
 7) Incorrect totals for companies without National Payer ID. (HD161024)
 ------------------------------------------------------------ 
 The total shown for Insurance companies without National Payer ID is 
 incorrect in the eIV Statistical Report. The report currently shows a 
 total for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ID's. It 
 should reflect the total of VA NATIONAL ID's (#.02) rather than the CMS 
 NATIONAL ID (#.03) from the PAYER (#365.12) file. 
   
   
 8) Ghost Buffer Issue. (HD64005)
 -------------------------------- 
 When a buffer entry was ACCEPTED before the actual response was 
 returned, it caused a ghost buffer entry to be created when the 
 actual response came in. The software should not create a new buffer 
 entry when the response comes in after the entry has been ACCEPTED. 
 Changes have been made for the response code to recognize the previously 
 accepted buffer entry and bypass the new buffer creation. 
   
   
 9) Chief Business Office (CBO) Extract Source of Information issue. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 The CBO extract was modified to transmit SOI codes with a value greater 
 than '4' without resetting them to a value of '1' (Interview). 
   
  
 10) Modifications to Response Report
 ------------------------------------
 Benefit status/info needs to be displayed for each benefit. Currently
 the status (Active/Inactive) is not reported. Additionally the notes
 for each benefit need to be displayed.
  
   
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR): 
 ------------------------------------------------------------- 
 20060512 - Additional Source of Information Codes. 
   
   
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s): 
 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 1. HD64597  - Patient Name Missing from Insurance Buffer file. 
 2. HD64005  - Ghost Buffer Entries created in the Insurance Buffer.
 3. HD136134 - SSN & DOB not populated when WHOSE INSURANCE is VETERAN. 
 4. HD161024 - Incorrect totals for companies without National Payer ID.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ================= 
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected. 
   
        Outputs for Preregistration       [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OUTPUTS] 
        Management Reports (Billing) Menu [IB OUTPUT MANAGEMENT REPORTS] 
        Process Insurance Buffer          [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] 
   
   
 In addition, the IIV EC HL7 Logical Link must be stopped using 
 the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option prior to performing the 
 install and restarted once the installation process has completed.  This 
 is required as the routines that perform response processing have been 
 altered in this patch.
