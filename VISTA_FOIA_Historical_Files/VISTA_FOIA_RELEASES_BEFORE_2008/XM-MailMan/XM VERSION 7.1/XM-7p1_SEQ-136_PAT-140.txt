                            field 20.3, SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE.  If that
                            field is empty, then we'll try field 8, TITLE.

                            field 8, TITLE.  If that field is empty, we

                            they will be displayed in the order you

 Users may choose the default selection to the prompt which appears with

            LAST EDITED:    JUL 17, 2000 
            HELP-PROMPT:    Select default new messages option 
            DESCRIPTION:    This is the default choice which will appear
                            when you select the 'New Messages and
                            Responses' option.  
                            If you don't choose a default, the default will
                            be 'Read new mail by basket'.  
  
 Also, when the user chooses to read new mail by basket, the user may have
 basket(s) other than the IN basket presented as the default basket(s) from
 which to read.  A new help frame (XM-U-P-READ NEW MSGS BSKT) has been added,
 and related help frames updated.  The following field has been added to the
 BASKET subfile of file 3.7, and is available for editing under
 'Personal Preferences|User Options Edit'.

                            Digits 
            DESCRIPTION:    When you read new messages by basket, MailMan
                            suggests the IN basket to read first.  If you
                            want MailMan to suggest other basket(s) before 
                            suggesting the IN basket, then fill in this
                            field with a priority order number.  MailMan
                            will suggest the basket(s) in the priority
                            order set by you.  The IN basket will be
                            suggested last.  (You will not be able to
                            choose the IN basket.)  Once all the priority
                            baskets have been read, MailMan will suggest
                            baskets in alphabetical order.

 Additionally:
 -When sending or forwarding a message using one of the ^XMD APIs, and there
 are no recipients, XMMG is set to "Error = No recipients."  Previously,
 there was no error message.
  
 -MailMan's version of FileMan's ^DIR 'set of codes' reader has been improved.
 It now offers selection completion and understands either the code or the
 text, and asks for clarification if the user enters something ambiguous.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*131.
