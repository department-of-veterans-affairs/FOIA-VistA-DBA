Subject: PRINT NKA IN ALLERGIES BLOCK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will print NKA (no known allergies) when appropriate in the
 Allergies block of Encounter Forms.  A change to the package interface
 routine IBDFN2 was necessary because patch GMRA*4*10 made a change that no
 longer sets the GMRAL array if the patient is unassessed or NKA.
