 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2006-064 - This patch MUST be installed before January 
 1, 2007. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch (together 
 with EAS*1.0*78 2007 GMT THRESHOLDS and IB*2.0*362 2007 RX COPAY

 The Means Test thresholds for Income Year 2006 provided in VHA DIRECTIVE 
 2006-064, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR 
 CALENDAR YEAR 2007 are distributed with this patch. The 
 post-installation routine, DG53734P, will create a new subentry (or 
 replace an existing one) for calendar year 2007 in the MEANS TEST DATA 
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS PARAMETERS (#43) file. Six subfields 
 within the multiple will be updated with the new Means Test threshold 
 data values as follows:
  
        MEANS TEST DATA (#.01) - 2007
        MT COPAY EXEMPT VET INCOME (#2)  - $27,790
        MT COPAY EXEMPT 1ST DEP INCOME (#3) - $5,560
        MT COPAY EXEMPT INCOME PER DEP (#4) - $1,866
        THRESHOLD PROPERTY (#8) - $80,000

 In addition, this patch will add new MEANS TEST/INCOME SCREENING entries
 for Income Year 2006 with the following data values to the PARAMETERS
 (#8989.5) file:

       ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will 
 take approximately 15 minutes. The Geographic Means Test Threshold files 
 GMT THRESHOLDS #712.5 and GMT MSA CODE #712.6 updates (for every zip code 
 and every county) in patch EAS*1.0*78, are extensive. Due to the volume 
 of updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop.  
 This is normal, as the file updates may take up to 15 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entry 
 after entry will scroll by on the screen. This is normal as there are 
 approximately 19,000 entries included in the #712.5 file (and 
 approximately 50,000 entries included in the #712.6 file) distributed 
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is 
 possible your session may time out before the install has completed. If 
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.  
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
  
   1.   Optional: If you choose to disable journaling on the process level,
        prior to installing this patch and at the programmer prompt type
        the following:
  
        >D DISABLE^%NOJRN
  
        If you have questions about journaling, please consult your VistA
        operations staff or log a ticket to the AXP Team.
