Description:
============

 ******************************N O T E************************************
 CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with the
 FB-CoreFLS development team.

 This patch addresses NOIS issues discovered in the 
 Controlled Substance package described below.
      
 Issue #1
 BHH-0104-40982 PSD DRUG RECEIPT HISTORY
      
 Problem
 -------
 When utilizing the option PSD DRUG RECEIPT HISTORY, a Dispensing location
 is prompted for.  The report prints all drug receipts regardless of the  
 dispensing location entered.  The report should show only drug receipts   
 pertaining to location that was entered.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine PSDREVD to show drug receipts 
 pertaining only to the dispensing location entered.
      
 Issue #2
 TOG-0104-10855 Green Sheet 2638 problem since Cache Conversion
      
 Problem
 -------
 There are two problems:
 1.  The barcode that prints in the header is overwriting other text in the
 center of the line.  In the DSM environment it would print in the right
 margin.
 2.  The pharmacy dispensing number is being truncated because the text is
 being printed too far to the right.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to routines PSDPGS1 and PSDRPGS2 to correct the
 barcode printing and Pharmacy Dispensing # issues in both the original
 Green Sheet print and the Reprint.
