 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s)
 ============================
 1) HD68616  - PSSMARK   DRUG INACTIVE DATE IN FUTURE BLOCKS CMOP MARK TODAY
  
 Problem
 -------
 When a drugs INACTIVE DATE is set for a future date, the "CMOP Mark/Unmark 
 (Single drug)  [CMOP MARK/UNMARK (SINGLE DRUG)  PSSXX MARK] option does not 
 check for future dates.  It only checks to see if the  INACTIVE DATE field
 (#100) of the DRUG file (#50) exists.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 The ^PSSMARK routine will be modified to check the INACTIVE DATE field 
 (#100) of the DRUG file (#50) for future dates.
   
 Technical
 ---------
 PSSMARK routine will be modified to check the INACTIVE DATE against the
 current date.  If the current date is less then the INACTIVE DATE, the
 "It has been inactivated." message will not be sent the user.
  
 2) HD70218  - PSSHLU    Drug file edits change value in ORDERABLE ITEMS
                         file (#101.43).
  
 Problem
 -------
 When editing the DRUG file (#50) using the "Drug Enter/Edit" [PSS DRUG
 ENTER/EDIT] option, the inpatient and outpatient flags in the ORDERABLE
 ITEMS file (#101.43) will be changed from NO to YES.  For schedule 2
 controlled substances, the outpatient flag is set to NO because a written
 prescription is still required.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 Add logic to check the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50)
 for Schedule II drug codes and the APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE field (#63)
 for Outpatient Pharmacy indicator.  If both are true, send a No value to
 the OUTPATIENT MED field (#50.2) of the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43).
   
 Technical
 ---------
 PSHLU routine will be modified to check the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3)
 of the DRUG file (#50) for Schedule II drug codes and the APPLICATION
 PACKAGES' USE field (#63) for Outpatient Pharmacy indicator.  If both are
 true, send a No value to the OUTPATIENT MED field (#50.2) of the ORDERABLE
 ITEMS file (#101.43).
