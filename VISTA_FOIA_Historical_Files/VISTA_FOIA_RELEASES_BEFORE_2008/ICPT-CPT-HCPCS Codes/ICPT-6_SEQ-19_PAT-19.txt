Subject: CTD - CPT CODE TEXT DESCRIPTORS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Informational

Description:
============

  The Code Text Descriptor (CTD) project adds the functionality of 
  versioning the short and long-text descriptions of the International
  Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM), Diagnostic Related Groupings 
  (DRG), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4) and Healthcare Common 
  Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) classification systems.  Once installed,
  the long and short text descriptors presented for these classifications
  will be date-sensitive (versioned) for all text changes occurring since
  Oct 1, 2002.
  
  This patch modifies the data dictionary for CPT/HCPCS Procedure file
  (file 81) and CPT Modifier file (file 81.3) to record a continuing 
  history of textual changes in the names and descriptions (short and
  long text) of diagnosis, procedures and DRG groupings.  Several APIs 
  have been modified to extract and return the date appropriate text 
  based on the history stored in the new fields.
  
  API SUMMARY
  ===========
  
     $$CPT^ICPTCOD(<code/IEN>,<date>,<source>,<DFN>)
  
        CPT/HCPCS Procedure Short Text - This API has been modified to 
        return a 10 piece "^" delimited string containing information
        about a CPT/HCPCS Procedure code.  The 3rd piece of the string is
        the name of the procedure (short text) and is date sensitive.
        The text returned is date appropriate based on the date passed
        to the API.  If no date is passed, then TODAY is used and the 
        current text is returned in piece 3.  If the date passed in 
        pre-dates text versioning (before Jan 1, 2002), then a warning
        message will be inserted at the 10th piece, warning the user that
        the text may be inaccurate. (DBIA 1995)
  
     $$CPTD^ICPTCOD(<Code>,<Array>,<DFN>,<Date>)
  
        CPT/HCPCS Description Long Text - This API has been modified to 
        return the date sensitive CPT/HCPCS description (long text).  The
        text returned is date appropriate based on the date passed to the
        API.  Output will be in an array designated by an input parameter.
        If the date passed in pre-dates text versioning (before Jan 1, 2002)
        then the array will contain a blank line followed by a warning 
        message that the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 1995)
 
     $$CODM^ICPTCOD(<Code>,<Array>,<Source>,<Date>,<DFN>)
 
        CPT Modifier Name Short Text - This API has been modified to return
        the date sensitive CPT Modifier name (short text) as the first piece
        of a subscripted array data element.  The text returned is date 
        appropriate based on the date passed to the API.  Output will be in
        an array designated by an input parameter.  (DBIA 1995)
  
     PERIOD^ICPTAPIU(<Code>,.<Array>)
  
        CPT/HCPCS Short Text - This API has been modified to include a
        date sensitive procedure name (short text) as the 2nd piece of
        a "^" delimited string.  The string will be returned in an array
        passed in by reference and subscripted by CPT/HCPCS procedure
        activation date.  The text returned is date appropriate based on
        the dates that define a period of activation for a CPT/HCPCS
        procedure code.  If the history/period has an activation date 
        and no inactivation date, then TODAY will be used, providing 
        the current text.  If the history/period has an activation date
        and an inactivation date, then the inactivation date will be 
        used, providing the text of the code on the day the period of 
        activation ended.  (DBIA 1997)
  
     $$MOD^ICPTMOD(<Modifier>,<Format>,<Date>,<Source>,<DFN>)
  
        CPT Modifier Short Text - This API has been modified to 
        return a 10 piece "^" delimited string containing information
        about a CPT Modifier code.  The 3rd piece of the string is
        the name of the modifier (short text) and is date sensitive.
        The text returned is date appropriate based on the date passed
        to the API.  If no date is passed, then TODAY is used and the 
        current text is returned in piece 3.  If the date passed in 
        pre-dates text versioning (before Jan 1, 2002), then a warning
        message will be inserted at the 10th piece, warning the user
        that the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 1996)
  
     $$MODD^ICPTMOD(<Code>,<Array>,<DFN>,<Date>)           NEW
  
        CPT Modifier Description Long Text - This is a NEW API created to 
        return the date sensitive CPT Modifier description (long text).  
        The text returned is date appropriate based on the date passed to 
        the API.  Output will be in an array designated by an input parameter.
        If the date passed in pre-dates text versioning (before Jan 1, 2002)
        then the array will contain a blank line followed by a warning 
        message that the text may be inaccurate.  (DBIA 1996)
 
     $$MODP^ICPTMOD(<Code>,<Modifier>,<Format>,<Date>,<Source>,<DFN>)
 
        CPT Modifier Name Short Text - This API has been modified so that
        when a Code/Modifier pair is acceptable, the second piece of the 
        returned string will contain the date sensitive CPT Modifier
        Name (short text).  The test returned is date appropriate based on
        the date passed to the API.  Output will be in the format designated 
        by an input parameter (format I - Internal, E - External).  
        (DBIA 1996)
