 This patch addresses two issues. The first issue is regarding the payment
 amount listed in the Electronic Remittance Advices (ERA) messages that is
 not equal to the amount for the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). The EFT
 can be used as reference for the ERA payment.
 The second issue concerns an undefined error during processing an EDI 
 LOCKBOX receipt.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
    1. ECH-0104-51126       $ Amt. of deposit not equal bill detail
      
       Problem
       -------
       Site reported that an entry in the Electronic Remittance Advice file
       (#344.4) has a negative amount for a line item. The total of the 
       line items in the Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) does not
       not equal the deposit amount in the EDI 3rd party EFT receipt detail
       record.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       The problem occurs when an adjustment is sent for a claim previously
       paid and the claim # reported by the payer does not exist in the 
       site's A/R.  Only the take-back part is recorded.  The new payment 
       information is being ignored. This patch will insure that even
       if the claim # is invalid, all parts of the adjustment are still
       included on the ERA.  This same problem will occur if there are
       2 or more EOBs (Electronic Explanation of Benefits) are included in
       the ERA.
       An additional problem was discovered when researching this problem. 
       If more than one EFT is retransmitted to a site, there may be a
       problem with the EFT # being duplicated in a second entry.  This
       patch corrects this by adding a DINUM to the.01 field of the 
       EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT file (#344.3).
  
       A PRE-INIT routine will be used to correct the entry of the EFTs in
       the EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT file (#344.3) and a POST-INIT routine will
       produce a list of the ERAs with invalid payment adjustments.  This
       list can then be used to assist the site in asking for the ERA's 
       to be retransmitted to them.
       
    2. TNV-0104-31951       ERROR IN PROCESS EDI LOCKBOX RECEIPT
       
       Problem
       -------
       While processing an EDI LOCKBOX receipt, if an ACH# has been
       sent on the EFT, the variable DA is not set and a "%DSM-E-UNDEF,
       undefined variable DA" error occurs at line DIE+4^DIE:1.
   
       Resolution
       ----------
       Modified routine to set the variable DA with the entry number from
       the AR BATCH PAYMENT file (#344), thus avoiding the problem.
  
    3. An environment check routine will be used to check if site has a
       CoreFLS version of software and recommend not to install this patch
       unless an accompanying update is made to the AR-CoreFLS software
       immediately after installation of this patch.
