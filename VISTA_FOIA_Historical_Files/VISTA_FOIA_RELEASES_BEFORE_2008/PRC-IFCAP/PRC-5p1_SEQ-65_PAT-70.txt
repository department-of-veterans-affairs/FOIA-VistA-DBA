 This patch addresses NOIS related issues for options History of Item
 Display /Print [PRCH ITEM HIST], and Print/Display Request Form [PRCSPRF].
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 PRO-1101-11605 - Undefined Variable LNCT
 PUG-0902-51103 - Undefined variable error due to missing $G
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. PRO-1101-11605 - Undefined Variable LNCT
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the History of Item Display /Print [PRCH ITEM HIST] option is run for
 an item that does not have a Fund Control Point history, and is queued to
 a device instead on being displayed on screen, the option will quit with
 an undefined error because one of the option variables, LNCT, was not saved 
 during queuing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The modified version of option routine PRCHRPT1 included in this patch will
 solve this problem.
  
  
 2. PUG-0902-51103 - Undefined variable error due to missing $G
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the Print/Display Request Form [PRCSPRF] option is used for a 2237 that
 has an invalid pointer in the CLASSIFICATION OF REQUEST (#410.2) file, the
 option will quit with an undefined error since the file entry no longer
 exists.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The modified version of option routine PRCSD121 included in this patch will
 solve this problem.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Dayton
 Gainsville (North Florida/South Georgia)
 GLAHS - West LA Campus
