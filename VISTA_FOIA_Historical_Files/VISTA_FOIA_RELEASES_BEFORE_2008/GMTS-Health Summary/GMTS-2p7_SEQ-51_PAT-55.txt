Subject: Demographics/Progress Note Fixes

Description: 
============

  This patch replaces patch GMTS*2.7*53 'Entered in Error'
     
    Fixes the occurrence limit problem with the          NOIS CPH-0302-41402
    Progress Notes components.  If no limit was               MIN-0302-42259
    set, the report would default to 10                       ALB-0302-50476
    occurrences.  After installing this patch,                COA-0302-22983
    removing the occurrence will result in the                DUB-0402-32340
    report printing all progress notes for the
    patient within the time limit.  Note:  If
    you are viewing progress notes from a remote
    site, and there is no limit set for the
    progress notes component, the in order to 
    view more than 10 occurrences, the remote
    site must also have this patch installed.
    (Routines GMTSPN and GMTSPNB)
     
    Fixes a problem of the Treating Facilities not       NOIS AUG-0302-32435
    appearing in the Demographic components of the
    Health Summary when the patient did not have
    a PCMM Team, PCMM provider, PCMM associate 
    provider or an inpatient attending physician.
    After installing this patch, Treating Facilities
    should display (when available) regardless of
    provider assignments.  Also, inpatient provider
    was added to the display.  In those cases where
    the inpatient provider and inpatient attending
    are the same person, then only one inpatient
    provider assignment is displayed.  (Routines 
    GMTSDEM, GMTSDEMP and GMTSDEMB)
     
    Fixes a problem with multiple patient selection      NOIS HUN-0202-22784
    left over from OERR 2.5.  This only affect users
    who still have OERR 2.5 preferences set in the
    New Person file, "SELECT PATIENT FROM" (field
    #100.16)  This field became obsolete with the 
    install of OERR 3.0, but the data may still
    remain.  Any remaining data stored in this field
    will be removed during the post-install of this
    patch.  (Routines GMTSDVR and GMTSP55)
   
    The prompt for Hospital Location in the option       NOIS CPH-0302-42497
    GMTS HS BY LOC (Hospital Location Health Summary)         DUB-0302-32599
    has been fixed so that it will accept a partial           NOP-0302-12911
    text entry.  (Routine GMTSPD)

   *  This routine is new with patch GMTS*2.7*53 (Entered in Error) or its
      replacement patch GMTS*2.7*55, whichever is installed first.
   
   ** Before installing this patch, the patch list for routine GMTSDVR may
      or may not include patch #49.  This is due to patch #49 being left
      off the patch list for patch GMTS*2.7*53 (Entered in Error).  If you 
      installed GMTS*2.7*53, then patch 49 will be missing from the 
      pre-GMTS*2.7*55 patch list.  After installing this patch, the patch
      list should look like the display in the table above.
   
      The "Before Patch" checksums are based on a pre-GMTS*2.7*53/GMTS*2.7*55 
      environment.
   
   INSTALLATION

      1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
          load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
    
      2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines in the Routine
          Summary are mapped, then they should be removed from the 
          mapped set at this time.
    
      3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
          select the Installation menu.
    
      4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following

            d.  Backup a Transport Global
   
      5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
          GMTS*2.7*55.

      7.  If you removed routines from the mapped set in step 2 above,
          then you should return those routines to the mapped set once the 
          installation has run to completion.
