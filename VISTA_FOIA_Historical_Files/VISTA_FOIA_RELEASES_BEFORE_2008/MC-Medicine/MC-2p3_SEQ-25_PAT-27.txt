 1)  This patch introduces a new entry point, a new extrinsic function,
     and a new routine, MCAPI to the Medicine Package.
  
 2)  Routine MCARP has been modified to generate the display of a single patient
     procedure.  These modifications have been made per request of the
     Consult/Request Tracking Developer and will be entered as a private
     Integration Agreement.
  
    ROUTINE: MCAPI
  COMPONENT: $$SINGLE(RESULT)
             Retrieval of a single patient procedure.

                            IEN is the file number of the desired patient 
                            procedure.
  
                            ROOT is the global root of the medicine file
