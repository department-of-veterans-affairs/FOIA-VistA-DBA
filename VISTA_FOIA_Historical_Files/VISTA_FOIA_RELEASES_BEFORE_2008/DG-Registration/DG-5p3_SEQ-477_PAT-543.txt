Subject: CLEANUP OF NAME COMPONENTS FILE #20

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch is a follow-on to Emergency patch DG*5.3*547 and will
 clean up the Name Components file #20 records which were affected
 by the release of DG*5.3*244 and the editing of certain patient names 
 through the functionality introduced by MPIF*1.0*28.

 ASSOCIATED NOIS:

 DUR-0703-31776 -  Appointment Reminder Letters
 Duplicates:

     WIM-1003-20353   PRINT SCHEDULING LETTERS -WRONG NAME PRINTS
  
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 DUR-0703-31776     Appointment Reminder Letters
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Print Scheduling Letters [SDPRLETTERS] option, the
 patient name components are obtained from the Name Components File #20
 record for that patient.  In some instances, the wrong patient's name
 prints. This occurs as a result of the problem explained in DG*5.3*547.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 A routine will run as part of the installation of this patch that
 will compare the PATIENT NAME .01 field for each record in the
 Patient Name file #2 with the Name Component file #20 record
 it points to and update the latter if necessary.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 Because the post-init routine DG53P543 must read thru the entire
 Patient File, the install may take a long time.  However, only a few
 records in the Name Component file #20 will need updating. 
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because the 
 following options will be out of service during the installation 
 process it is suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours:
  
        DG REGISTRATION VIEW             View Registration Data 
        DG LOAD PATIENT DATA             Load/Edit Patient Data 
        DG REGISTER PATIENT              Register a Patient
  
 The following information is provided in an attempt to help the installer 
 make that decision:
