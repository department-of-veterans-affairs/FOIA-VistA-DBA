Description:
============

  
 This patch is to be installed on or before 12/08/2003.
  
 I.  Overview
  
 This enhancement patch provides the messaging structure for retrieving
 patient demographic data from the last VA facility that treated a veteran
 (referred to as the Last Site Treated or LST) when the veteran registers at
 a new site for the first time.  The ROM LST query requires a National ICN
 and Treating Facility List from the MPI and the patient should have a
 treatment date at the last site.  The LST query is invoked during the
 initial registration process after the HEC Enrollment and MPI queries are
 completed and before the first registration screen is displayed.
  
 The user will be notified about the progress of the query when:
    +  The National ICN is not available
    +  The Treating Facility List is not available
    +  The query times out after 60 seconds
    +  The query completes successfully
    +  When Confidential Address information is retrieved
    +  When Sensitive Patient information is retrieved
    +  When date of death is received (but not filed)
  
 The purpose of the patch is to retrieve data from the LST that is not
 currently provided by the MPI or the HEC/EDB.  The Register Once initiative
 is an interim solution designed to reduce the amount of manual data entry
 needed for a new registration for veterans that have been treated somewhere
 else in the VA system.  The veteran will not have to provide information
 multiple times when registering at a new facility.
  
 The DGRO name space is used for the Register Once Messaging routines,
 globals, and protocols.

     Site Treated (LST):
  
     1.  VistA shall retrieve patient demographic data for patients that
         have been designated as Sensitive at the LST.  VistA shall file the
         retrieved data directly into the requesting site's local database.
  
     2.  VistA shall not retrieve the appropriate indicators, flags, and/or
         file entries that identify the patient as Sensitive.  VistA shall
         not retrieve the Primary Eligibility Code or the Patient Type since
         these data elements are received at the local VistA site from their 
         authoritative source: the HEC.

     HEC, Patient is not designated with Sensitive Patient Flag at the Last
     Site Treated (LST):
  
     1.  VistA shall retrieve patient demographic data for patients that
         have not been designated as Sensitive at the LST.  VistA shall file
         the retrieved data directly into the requesting site's local
         database.  
  
     2.  VistA shall not retrieve the appropriate indicators, flags, and/or
         file entries that identify the patient as Sensitive.  VistA shall
         not retrieve the Primary Eligibility Code or the Patient Type since
         these data elements are received at the local VistA site from their
         authoritative source: the HEC.
  
     Sensitive Patient Flag is not received by the local VistA site from the
     HEC, Patient is designated with Sensitive Patient Flag at the Last Site
     Treated (LST):
  
     1.  VistA shall retrieve patient demographic data for patients that
         have been designated as Sensitive at the LST.  VistA shall file the
         retrieved data directly into the requesting site's local database.
  
     2.  VistA shall retrieve the appropriate indicators, flags, and/or file
         entries that identify the patient as Sensitive.  VistA shall not
         retrieve the Primary Eligibility Code or the Patient Type since
         these data elements are received at the local VistA site from their
         authoritative source: the HEC.
  
     3.  VistA shall file the indicators, flags, and/or file entries at the
         requesting site so that the Patient continues to be identified as
         Sensitive.
  
     4.  VistA shall also place a "Sensitive Patient Data Retrieved" 
         notification into a mail message that shall be automatically sent
         to the new DG REGISTER ONCE mail group established for the data
         sharing of the RO project.
  
     5.  VistA shall automatically send the mail message containing the
         "Sensitive Patient Data Retrieved" notification to the members of
         the new mail group and to the local user at the requesting site who
         site who performed the registration of the patient.
  
     6.  VistA shall automatically initiate the existing mail bulletin to
         the Information Security Officer (ISO) to provide notification that
         a sensitive patient has been accessed.
  
     7.  VistA shall automatically create the appropriate entry in the
         existing security log file audit trail which records accesses to
         sensitive patient information.

 F.  Mail Groups:
     ============
 A new mail group (DG Register Once) is established to allow MailMan
 messages to be communicated to those personnel associated with Register
 Once Messaging at a given site.
  
 Mail Group Name:  DG REGISTER ONCE
  
 G.  Mailman Messages:
     =================
  
 Three Mailman messages are generated by the ROM application:
  
 a.  Notification of the DG REGISTER ONCE mail group when Date-of-Death
     information is received from the LST.  Note that the DOD information
     is not filed into the Patient's database.
  
 b.  Notification of the DG REGISTER ONCE mail group and local ISO when
     Sensitive-Patient data is retrieved from the LST.
  
 c.  Notification of the DG REGISTER ONCE mail group when a Confidential
     Address is received from the LST with a future start date.
  
  
 H.  Bulletins:
     ==========
     ROM will use an existing exception application interface (API) to notify
     the MPI if there is a problem with the ICN at the LST.
  
  
 Documentation
 =============
  
 All hard copy training manuals have been sent to site enrollment
 coordinators. Any site needing more copies should contact Laura Meade
 with the required amount of manuals (subject to remaining availability)
 or visit the following web site and download / print the training manual:
   
 <http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/Enrollment/RegisterOnce.htm> 
  
 FTP Documentation Retrieval
 ===========================
   
    Documentation: Register Once  RegisterOnceNov2003manual.pdf  
   The preferred method is to FTP the file in binary mode from:
    
       download.vista.med.va.gov
    
    which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
    
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations.
     
       Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 I.  Installation Instructions:
     ==========================
  
 Although this patch may be loaded with users on the system, it is advised
 that DG REGISTER A PATIENT option not be in use during the installation.
 Because it affects Registration, you may want to install it during
 non-peak hours.  The install will take about 10 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  [Note: TEXT
      PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text
      only.]
  
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System, select the
      Installation menu. 
  
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*533)
  
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
           installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
  
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
           to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
           global.
  
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*533.
  
  5.  You will be prompted for the name of the coordinator for the new mail
      group DG REGISTER ONCE.  Please enter the name of the individual who
      should be responsible for maintaining this mail group, which will
      receive important alerts about Date of Death, Confidential Address,
      and Sensitive Patient information.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGON during the install? YES//'
      respond YES
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter:
  
      DG REGISTER A PATIENT
  
      (This will place DG REGISTER A PATIENT option out of order during
      the installation.)
  
  8.  When prompted to select the protocols that you would like to place
      'out of order', Press Enter since no protocols need to be selected.
  
  9.  Appropriate personnel should be added to the new DG REGISTER ONCE
      mail group.
