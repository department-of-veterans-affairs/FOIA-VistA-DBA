Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project. PFSS patches are being released on various schedules. Some patch
 functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is activated
 during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented at select
 pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system. The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing 
 replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The 
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at 
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/billreplace/
  
 Features of patch SR*3*144 are listed below:
  
 1. The VistA Surgery software will be enhanced to request an account
    number for every Surgery Request Consult. This activity will support
    the Revenue Office's need to pre-certify with insurance companies the
    requested Surgery. A national guideline will be issued defining the
    minimum format for creating a Surgery Request Consult within the VistA
    Consults package that will collect the data required by PFSS. The
    Surgery Request Consult will not create a Surgery case. This guideline
    does not require that sites use CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING V. 3.0 for
    creating Surgery requests. Sites using VistA Surgery Request options
    can continue to use that method.
  
    VistA Surgery will also be enhanced to request a PFSS ACCOUNT
    REFERENCE, and it will be stored in the PFSS ACCOUNT REFERENCE field
    (#500) of the SURGERY file (#130). The association to a PFSS ACCOUNT
    REFERENCE is obtained when the Surgery case is created and is sent to
    the PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTER (PCE) application upon completion of coding.
  
 2. This patch changes the List Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes [SRSCPT]
    option to list only those completed cases that do not have a final CPT 
    code entered in the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE field (#.02) of the
    SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).

 DATA DICTIONARY UPDATES:
 ========================
 This patch modifies the following fields in the SURGERY file (#130):
 - DATE OF OPERATION (#.09)
 - PFSS ACCOUNT REFERENCE (#500)
  
 This patch exports a new surgery protocol SR RECEIVE. This protocol needs
 to be added manually to the nationally released protocol OR EVSEND GMRC at
 sites using IDX FlowcastTM for billing at the patch installation time.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites will retrieve VistA software and documentation from the following
 FTP addresses. The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
  
  Albany            ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
