 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000088122 - Updates to AMIE Nose, Sinus, Larynx, and Pharynx C & P
                   Worksheet
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE C & P worksheet for Nose, Sinus, Larynx, and Pharynx, to change
     the text in several of the existing paragraphs.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA93PI which will deactivate the
         current Nose, Sinus, Larynx, and Pharynx worksheet (file 396.6,
         IEN 134), and activate the new Nose, Sinus, Larynx, and Pharynx
         worksheet (file 396.6, IEN 200).
     b)  Created routine DVBCWNW3 that contains the text for the new
         Nose, Sinue, Larynx, and Pharynx worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWNW2 to access the text routine in b), and
         print the new Nose, Sinus, Larynx, and Pharynx worksheet.
