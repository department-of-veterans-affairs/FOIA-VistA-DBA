Subject: INPATIENT MEDICATION ORDERS FOR OUTPATIENTS PHASE II

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 ***Important Note***
 The Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients functionality will not be
 fully visible until the release of patch SD*5.3*285.
  
  
 1. A request has been made to allow sites to define inpatient orders for 
 outpatients' behavior on a clinic-by-clinic basis. The two changes would 
 add the ability to control auto-dc of orders and whether or not they
 appear in the Bar Code Medication Administration V. 3.0 package. This
 patch helps to accomplish this goal by doing the following:
  
 a. Rename the CLINIC STOP DATES file (#53.46) to be the CLINIC DEFINITION 
    file (#53.46).
 b. Add the AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS field (#2) and the SEND TO BCMA? field (#3) 
    to the CLINIC DEFINITION file (#53.46).
 c. Remove the Clinic Stop Dates [PSJ CSD] option.
 d. Add the Clinic Definition [PSJ CD] option.
  
 2. A problem was reported with inpatient orders for outpatients 
 displaying in the incorrect display group on the Orders tab in the 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. This patch corrects this
 problem by modifying the HL7 messaging as well as the order editing 
 process to correctly define the appointment date and time for the
 inpatient order.
  
 3. It was discovered during internal review that the STAT NOW MAIL GROUP 
 field (#5) of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6) had been omitted 
 from the appropriate distribution. This patch corrects this problem by 
 exporting the field.
  
 4. A problem was identified with the display order on the meds tab in 
 CPRS. The problem was related to information being passed from Inpatient 
 Medications V. 5.0 to identify inpatient orders for outpatients. This 
 patch corrects this problem by modifying the data pass to CPRS.
