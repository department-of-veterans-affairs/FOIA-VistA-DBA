 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 ISD-0704-70103/HD68093      Duplicate entries in 1020.2
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Each time menu option Build/Rebuild Other Facility Xref [PPP BUILD FFX]
 is run it adds a new entry for each entry in the PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF
 file (#1020.2) thus creating duplicate entries.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 If the entry already exists in the PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF file (#1020.2),
 only update the LAST VISIT DATE field if applicable.  Do not create a 
 duplicate entry.
 Part of the Post-Install is to clean up any erroneously set duplicate entries.
 The PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF file (#1020.2) needs to be deleted using the 
 kill command at the programmer's prompt: K ^PPP(1020.2).  
 The zero node then needs to get set up using the set command: 
 S ^PPP(1020.2,0)="PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF^1020.2PI^0^0"
 Menu option Build/Rebuild Other Facility Xref [PPP BUILD FFX] then needs to
 be run to rebuild the PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF file (#1020.2).
   
 ISD-0704-70103/HD68093      Duplicate entries in 1020.2
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 When menu option Build/Rebuild Other Facility Xref [PPP BUILD FFX] is run
 it does not update the last auto-build date in the PPP PARAMETER file 
 (#1020.1).
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Update the Last Auto-build Date field (#3) of the PPP PARAMETER file 
 (#1020.1) when the Build/Rebuild Other Facility Xref [PPP BUILD FFX] option
 is run.
  
 MAC-0804-60809/HD68187      Not being alerted about all patients
 Problem 3:
 ----------
 When menu option Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH] is
 run, all patients are not checked for the Hospital Location file 
 (#44, multiple 44.003).
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
 Need to modify the code so it loops through all patients.
  
 LEX-1103-42146/HD67796      Nightly Failure-Undefined Error
 Problem 4:
 ----------
 When running menu option Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP
 BATCH], an undefined error was occurring.  This was caused by the use of the
 variable I.  This variable was being killed in class 3 software.  
  
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
 This variable needs to be changed to PPPI.
