 This patch resolves some outstanding ROADS to FORDS conversion issues,
 implements the ONCOLOGY display of the PROBLEM LIST and resolves other 
 miscellaneous problems.
 
 This patch also resolves NOIS BRX-1004-10515 (UNDEF ERROR).
 
  1) ROADS to FORDS Conversion Errata
 
     a) The conversion of REASON FOR NO SURGERY (#165.5,58) did not take 
        CLASS OF CASE (#165.5,.04) into account and, therefore, failed to
        convert autopsy only cases properly.  This has been fixed with the
        following re-conversion logic:
 
        If CLASS OF CASE = 5 (Dx at autopsy), REASON FOR NO SURGERY has been 
        set to 9 (Unknown/dx at autopsy/death cert).
 
     b) The original conversion of HORMONE THERAPY (#165.5,54.2) and HORMONE
        THERAPY @FAC (#165.5,54.3) converted ROADS codes of "0" to the FORDS
        code of "00" without regard to REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY (#165.5,77)
        value.  This has been fixed with the following re-conversion logic:
 
        If HORMONE THERAPY or HORMONE THERAPY @FAC equal 00 (None) and REASON
        FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY equals one of the following values, the HORMONE
        THERAPY and HORMONE THERAPY @FAC values will be converted to the
        corresponding "no treatment" value.
 
        If REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY = 2 (Contraindicated, autopsy-only
        cases), HORMONE THERAPY and HORMONE THERAPY @FAC will be converted 
        to 82 (Not admin/contraindicated).
 
        If REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY = 6 (Reason unk), HORMONE THERAPY 
        and HORMONE THERAPY @FAC will be converted to 86 (Not admin, no reason
        given).
 
        If REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY = 7 (Pt refused HT), HORMONE THERAPY
        and HORMONE THERAPY @FAC will be converted to 87 (Refused by pt).
 
        If REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY = 8 (HT recommended, unk if
        administered), HORMONE THERAPY and HORMONE THERAPY @FAC will be
        converted to 88 (Unknown if admin).
 
  2) PROBLEM LIST
 
     As an aid in answering the COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6 (#160,25-25.5)
     prompts, the patient's active PROBLEM LIST can now be displayed prior 
     to prompting for COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6.
 
     The registrar will be asked:
 
     Would you like to see a PROBLEM LIST for this patient to assist
     you in entering the COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6 prompts? Yes//
 
     If YES, the PROBLEM LIST will be displayed. 
 
     DATE OF ONSET  ICD DIAGNOSIS
     -------------  -------------------------------------------
     JAN 15, 1967   799.9    UNKN CAUSE MORB/MORT NEC
     AUG 12, 1993   367.1    MYOPIA
     AUG 12, 1994   716.90   ARTHROPATHY NOS-UNSPEC
 
  3) [CC Create State Data Disk] start/stop date prompts
 
     The start and stop date prompts for the VACCR and NAACCR STATE extracts
     have been modified and the 'HELP' prompts enhanced.
 
     They now appears as follows:
 
     Start, Date Case Completed:  ?
 
     Enter the DATE CASE COMPLETED date of the
     FIRST abstract you would like to report.
  
     End, Date Case Completed:  ?
 
     Enter the DATE CASE COMPLETED date of the
     LAST abstract you would like to report.
 
  4) COLLABORATIVE STAGING HELP TEXT
 
     Some Collaborative Staging HELP text was not formatting correctly.  
     This has been fixed.
 
  5) COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6 (#160,25-25.5)
 
     In the past, all ICD-9-CM "V" codes were not allowable as values for
     COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6.  This has changed.  Only the following
     "V" codes are now prohibited:
 
     V01-V07.1, V07.4-V09.91, V16-V21.9, V23.2-V25.3, V25.5-V43.89, 
     V46-V50.4, or V50.8-V83.89).
 
     All other "V" codes are now acceptable.
 
  6) NAACCR extract problem resolutions
 
     The patch ONC*2.11*41 post-install routine will check for "no treatment"
     and "unknown treatment" conditions and stuff the associated treatment
     fields appropriately.
 
  7) [PSR Purge Suspense Records]
 
     The above option has been added to the [UTL *..Utility Options ...] 
     menu.
     This option will either:
     a) Purge ALL suspense records for the user's division or
     b) Purge all suspense records for a specified SUSPENSE DATE 
        (#160.075,.01) range for the user's division
 
     If, after the suspense record purge, the patient has no suspense 
     records and no primaries, the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (#160) record will be 
     deleted.
 
  8) DATE OF FIRST CONTACT         (#165.5,155)
     SEER SUMMARY STAGE 2000       (#165.5,35)
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #1 (#165.5,34) 
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #2 (#165.5,34.1) 
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #3 (#165.5,34.2) 
 
     DATE OF FIRST CONTACT has been made "required for completion".  DATE OF
     FIRST CONTACT must contain a value in order to change the ABSTRACT 
     STATUS (#165.5,91) to 3 (Complete).
 
     Due to the implementation of Collaborative Staging for 2004+ cases, the
     following "required for completion" fields are now required only for
     pre-2004 cases.
 
     SEER SUMMARY STAGE 2000
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #1 
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #2
     SITE OF DISTANT METASTASIS #3
 
  9) MAJOR SALIVARY GLANDS SIXTH EDITION AJCC STAGE GROUPING
 
     The Sixth Edition AJCC STAGE GROUPING for MAJOR SALIVARY GLANDS (C07.9,
     C08.0-C08.9) was incorrect for the TNM combinations T2 N0 MO and T3 M0 
     N0.
 
     Old STAGE GROUPING:      I (T2 N0 M0) and  II (T3 N0 M0)
     Correct STAGE GROUPING: II (T2 N0 M0) and III (T3 N0 M0)
 
     This has been fixed.
 
 10) LYMPH NODES C77.0-C77.9
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY (R)      (#165.5,58.2)
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (R) (#165.5,50.2)
     
     For LYMPH NODE (C77.0-C77.9) cases the ROADS fields SURGERY OF PRIMARY 
     (R) and SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (R) were displaying the FORDS LYMPH NODE
     Site-Specific Surgery Codes as selectable choices.  This has been 
     fixed.    
 
 11) TNM Edition Number [1060] 593-594
 
     For cases which do not have an AJCC coding scheme, as per AJCC Editions
     5 and 6, the NAACCR item "TNM Edition Number" should contain a value of
     88 (Not applicable).
 
     For 1996+ cases which have CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (#165.5,38) and 
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP (#165.5,88) values of NA (88), the NAACCR item
     "TNM Edition Number" should contain a value of 88 (Not applicable). 
 
 12) Collaborative Staging
 
     In order to prevent occasional "Cannot connect to host" errors caused by 
     network problems, we have increased the timeout value from 3 to 15 seconds. 
     This should eliminate "false alarms".
 
 13) [ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...]
       [PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)]
 
     The computed field DIAGNOSIS EPISODE CARE (#165.5,3.1) has been removed
     from the [PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)] report.  This field had 
     been inadvertently included in the report output.
 
 14) [ANN *..Annual Reports ...]
       [CPR Print Custom Reports]
 
     If the registrar attempted to produce a report sorted by CLINICAL T
     (#165.5,37.1), the program would abort with a "undefined variable M"
     error.  This has been fixed.
 
 15) [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
       [RS Registry Summary Reports]
         F Follow-Up
 
     The FOLLOW-UP RATE report has been enhanced to include the following 
     line:
      
     Successful follow-up currency (all patients)  (F)   **
          (** should be 90%) 
 
 16) ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91)
 
     When attempting to "Complete" an abstract, if CLASS OF CASE 
     (#165.5,.04) is blank, the following error message will display:
 
      CLASS OF CLASS is blank.
      "Required" field checking requires CLASS OF CASE.
