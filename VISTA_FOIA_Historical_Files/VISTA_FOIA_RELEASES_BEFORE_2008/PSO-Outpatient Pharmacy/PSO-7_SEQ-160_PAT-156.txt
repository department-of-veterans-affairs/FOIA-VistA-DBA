Description:
============

  
   
  There are three patches to support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation
  Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the
  following order:
                    PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy
                    PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management
                    PSN*4*84       National Drug File
  
  They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to
  implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features.  Please
  refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the
  names of the documentation files.
  
  Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail
  for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is
  only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
  directory.  The name of the installation guide is 
  PS_OUTPATIENT_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_IG.PDF.
  
  
  The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to
  ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient
  Pharmacy V. 7.0 automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs
  Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is
  written to HL7 standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as
  the Baker APS Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to
  V. 2.3.1 standard using locally developed software.  The automated
  dispensing systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.
  
  This patch includes the following new features:
  1. Enhance the current Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 HL7 interface to
     the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.
  2. Creates a bi-directional interface.  The interface transmits
     outpatient pharmacy data to multiple vendor systems utilized by VAMCs
     and receives dispensed prescription data from the vendor systems.  
  3. The dispense completion message received back from the vendor will
     automatically release the prescription in VISTA if the FILE RELEASE 
     DATE/TIME field (#105.1) is set to YES in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  4. The interface sends outpatient pharmacy prescription release 
     information to the vendor once a prescription is manually released.
  5. The BusinessWare interface engine at each medical center is used
     to pass the HL7 data through from VISTA to the dispensing system.  
     There is no data manipulation on BusinessWare's part.
  6. Enhance the activity log entries for the sequence of events for a 
     prescription's activity in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  7. Add a fourth selection to the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), EXTERNAL
     INTERFACE field (#5).  This selection is titled 'SEND MARKED ORDERS
     AND PRINT LABEL'.
  8. This patch allows dispensing system printer(s) to be entered and used 
     when selected, and the interface is in use, sending an HL7 message 
     to the dispensing system.
  9. This patch added new functionality for reprinting Rxs and using the
     external interface.  If a reprint of an Rx is requested the user is
     asked if they want to resend the Rx to the external interface.
  
  This patch installs the updated routines needed by HL7 V. 2.4
  Automated Dispensing Machines.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  The Outpatient Pharmacy User Manual, as well as the Outpatient Pharmacy
  Technical Manual/Security Guide, have been updated to reflect these
  modifications. In addition to these two manuals, the following documents
  have also been revised to reflect the new features provided with the
  Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface project:
  
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 Technical Manual/Security Guide, 
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 User Manual, 
         Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Automation Interface Installation Guide
         Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Automation Interface Release Notes 
  
   
  The revised Outpatient Pharmacy Technical Manual/Security Guide, 
  Outpatient Pharmacy User Manual, Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
  Installation Guide, and the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
  Release Notes are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
  the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files need 
  to be retrieved in binary format.
   
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
   (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
   download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
   available FTP server.
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
   
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
   The documentation distribution includes:
   
                                                                RETRIEVAL
