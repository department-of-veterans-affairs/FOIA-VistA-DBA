  - Input Template

Description:
============

  The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several
  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
  packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat
  Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation
  From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service
  Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other
  medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of service
  connection.
  
  Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed
  and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this
  type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the
  number of product line dependencies.  Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim
  Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in the
  Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  It
  provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for the
  combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports cross-referenced
  against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing process.  Phase II
  of this initiative will involve multiple product lines and additional VistA
  only development.  The main goals of Phase II will be to fully automate the
  copayment billing processing of combat vets based on episode of care by
  providing the appropriate questions at check-out as supplied by CPRS.
  
  Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include
  Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated Mail
  Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE),
  Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF.  The National Patient
  Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload
  reporting.  The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
  installed.  It should be noted all patches with the exception of the PIMS
  host file have been previously released and the installation status of
  those patches should be validated at your site prior to installation the
  PIMS build:

  Product Features
  There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
    a.  Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical
        care
        o  The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those
           veterans who qualify as such per the directive
        o  The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
           audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
           schedulers, etc.)
        o  Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
           was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
           manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC
           conditions, etc.
    b.  Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
        Combat Related
        o  Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to
           identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
           related condition
    c.  Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care,
        prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
        treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless
        changed by pharmacist.
  
  
  This patch distributes the changes to Registration in support of the Combat
  Veteran initiative.
  
  
  File Changes
  ------------
  The POTENTIALLY RELATED TO COMBAT field (#79.31) was added to the PTF
  file (#45).
  
  The POTENTIALLY RELATED TO COMBAT field (#31) was added to the 501
  multiple (subfile #45.02) of the PTF file (#45).
  
  
  Registration Changes
  --------------------
  If a veteran has entered military service after September 1980, the text
  of the message that is displayed during the registration process has been
  modified to read as follows:
  
   Entered Service JUN 1,1986
   Veteran must have completed at least 24 consecutive months of active
   military service. If veteran meets an exception to minimum duty requirements
   as listed on www.va.gov/elig, veteran is eligible for VA health care.
   Otherwise, enter Ineligible Date and Reason on Screen 10 -- veteran is
   eligible for care of SC conditions only.
  
  
  PTF Changes
  -----------
  The 101 screen has been modified to display the patient's Combat Veteran
  status end date.
  
  The 501 screen has been modified to display/collect the Combat Veteran
  classification question.
  
  The patient's Combat Veteran status has been added at character position
  88 of the 101 segment.
  
  The patient's Combat Veteran status end date has been added to character
  positions 89 through 94 of the 101 segment.
  
  Whether or not any movement was related to the patient's Combat Veteran
  status was added to character position 108 of the 701 segment.
  
  The PTF Close-Out Error screen has been modified to display the Combat
  Veteran data that was added to the 101 and 701 segments.
  
  The Inquire PTF Record [DG PTF COMPREHENSIVE INQUIRY] and Comprehensive 
  Report by Admission [DG PTF COMPREHENSIVE REPORT] options have been 
  modified to display the POTENTIALLY RELATED TO COMBAT field."
    
    
  ZEL (VA Specific Eligibility) Segment Changes
  ---------------------------------------------
  Combat Veteran status information has been added to the ZEL segment.
  The patient's Combat Veteran status (1 = YES, 0 = NO) is sequence 36 and
  the date the patient's Combat Veteran status ends is sequence 37.  
  NOTE: These sequences are only available through the entry point
        EN1^VAFHLZEL and not through the entry point $$EN^VAFHLZEL.
  
  
  Input TEMPLATE Changes
  ----------------------
  Input templates DG501 and DG501F were modified to collect the Combat
  Veteran classification question.  These templates were also modified
  to prompt for the classification questions using the same wording as
  PCE instead of the field label.

   1. Download the KIDS file COMBAT_VET_PHASE_II_PIMS.KID from the
      ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake
      OIFO to the appropriate directory on your system.
  
   2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
      enter: COMBAT_VET_PHASE_II_PIMS.KID
  
   3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
   4. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the appropriate patch
      designation - PX*1.0*130, SD*5.3*325, DG*5.3*565, EC*2.0*54):
  
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package COMBAT VET
      PHASE II PIMS 1.0.
  
   7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//',respond NO.
  
   8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

   9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
  
  10. The pre and post install routines SD53325 and SD53325A can be deleted
      after receiving the message that the SD*5.3*325 post init has run to
      completion.
