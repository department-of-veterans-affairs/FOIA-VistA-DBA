Description: 
============

 This patch releases three new NATIONAL reminders and dialogs required for 
 the Mental Health QUERI project.  They are placed into the REMINDER 
 EXCHANGE file (#811.8).
  
      VA-ANTIPSYCHOTIC MED SIDE EFF EVAL
      VA-DEPRESSION SCREENING
      VA-POS DEPRESSION SCREEN FOLLOWUP
  
 The Mental Health clinical reminders in this patch have been developed by 
 the Mental Health Clinical Reminders Project and the Office of Information 
 (OI) System Design & Development (SDD) Health Data systems group. The 
 reminders contain provider interventions for Mental Health management of 
 patients with possible mental health problems.
 
 This patch will also install two Reminder Result Elements into file 801.41 
 and one routine:
 
      PXRM AUDC RESULT ELEMENT 1
      PXRM AUDC RESULT ELEMENT 2
      PXRMDLR (routine)
 
 These elements will replace the current PXRM AUDC RESULT ELEMENT 1 and PXRM 
 AUDC RESULT ELEMENT 2. The new elements contain the condition statement that 
 will evaluate the AUDC score returned from the Mental Health package against
 a patient's sex.
