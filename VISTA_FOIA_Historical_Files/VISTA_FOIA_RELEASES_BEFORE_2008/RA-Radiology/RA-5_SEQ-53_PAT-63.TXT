Subject: Performance Indicator OQP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 This patch will limit OQP Performance Management staff's receipt of the 
 Radiology Performance Indicator summary report to the automatic mid-month 
 report.  The staff may receive certain manually initiated summary reports 
 only if the user (1) requests a full month's data (any time in the past) 
 and (2) answers "Y" to the question, "Do you want to include the OQP 
 Performance Management staff as a recipient of this output?"  
  
 1.  A new field, "OQP PERFORMANCE MGMT?", has been added to the RAD/NUC 
     MED DIVISION file (#79), PERF INDC SMTP E-MAIL ADDRESS subfile 
     (#79.01751). The patch installation will put data into this new field.
     (See next item.)
  
 2.  Routine RA63PST is new and will only be used during the 
     post-installation phase of the patch.  It will populate the new field,
     "OQP PERFORMANCE MGMT?", with either "Y" or "N", based upon the value
     in the field, PERF INDC SMTP E-MAIL ADDRESS.  If the e-mail address is
     "VHARADIOLOGYREPORTS@HQ.MED.VA.GOV" (upper or lowercase), then the new
     field will be set to "Y"; otherwise, the new field will be set to "N".
     This routine may be deleted after the installation.
  
 3.  Routine RAPM2 has been modified to check if the manually requested 
     date range is a full month, and if it is, to ask, "Do you want to
     include the OQP Performance Management staff as a recipient of this
     output".  If the answer is "N", then the requested report will not be
     sent to the OQP Performance Management e-mail address.  However, the
     automatically generated mid-month report will always be sent to the
     OQP Performance Management e-mail address.
  
 4.  Routine RAPM3 has been modified to flag when the previous month's 
     summary report is being calculated, whether from a manually initiated
     job or the automatic mid-month background job.   This affects the
     following menus and options:
  
         'IRM Menu' [RA PERFORMIN SCHEDULE]
            'Schedule Perf. Indic. Summary for 15th of month' [RA 
             PERFORMIN SCHEDULE].
  
         'Performance Indicator' [RA PERFORMIN MENU]
            'Run Previous Month's Summary Report' [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM].
  
  
     It will also display the value of the new field, "OQP PERFORMANCE 
     MGMT?".  This affects the following options:
  
         'Enter/Edit OUTLOOK mail group' [RA PERFORMIN MAIL GROUP ENTRY]
         'Run Previous Month's Summary Report' [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM]
  
     It will also drop the "/time" from a prompt, since time cannot be 
     entered for that prompt.  This affects the option, 'Run Previous
     Month's Summary Report' [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM].  See the example from
     item 5 below.
  
     
 5.  Routine RAPM4 has been added to check the requested date range.  If 
     the requested date range is a full month (any time in the past), then
     an extra question would appear, and if "??" is entered, additional
     explanation would be displayed.  This affects the following options:
  
           Run Previous Month's Summary Report [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM]
           Summary/Detail report [RA PERFORMIN RPTS]

      The Summary Report of Last Month's data will be sent to the
      Outlook mail group(s) in File 79's PERF INDC SMPT E-MAIL ADDRESS
      with "N" defined for OQP Performance Management.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   The install time for this patch should take less than 5 minutes.  Since 
   the changes apply only to the Performance Indicator menu, this patch can
   be installed when Rad/Nuc Med users are on the system.  The users will
   be locked out of the Radiology Performance Indicators options, but not
   locked out of the other Radiology options.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*63.
   
        When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
        YES//", respond YES.      
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA PERFORM*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", just press the RETURN key to bypass this prompt.
   
     5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*63).
  
     6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
     7. Delete routine RA63PST.
