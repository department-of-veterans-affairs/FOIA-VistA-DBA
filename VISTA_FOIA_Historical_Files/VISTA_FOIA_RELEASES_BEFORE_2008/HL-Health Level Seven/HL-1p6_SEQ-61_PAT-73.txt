Subject: SystemLink Monitor Blank Screen

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Test sites:        Alexandria, Sheridan, Greater Los Angeles Regional
                    Healthcare (West Los Angeles)
  
 NOIS:              NOL-0600-72179
  
 Note:              This patch requires that KIDS build HL*1.6*66
                    be installed
  
 This patch fixes a problem where users of the 'Systems Link Monitor
 [HL MESSAGE MONITOR]' menu option sometimes experience a blank screen
 (screen freezes) from which they cannot escape when another user is
 editing one of the entries in the HL Logical Link file (#870)
 at the same time.
   
 Patch HL*1.6*73 makes sure that instead of freezing the System Link
 Monitor Screen, the user is given a warning which shows those links which
 are locked. Information regarding the possibility that some of the
 reported totals might be slightly off, is displayed. After the
 warning is displayed, the option works as usual..
   
 Displayed Warning (actual link names will vary):
  
     Editing of logical link data is occurring right now.  For this
     reason, some of the information on the 'System Link Monitor'
     report might not be accurate for the following node(s)...

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If the HLCSMON routine is
        mapped, it should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager. Use the options:

    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3 Print Transport Global
           4 Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5 Backup a Transport Global

          Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?'.
  
    6.  Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers. Use the
  
  
          Filer and Link Management Options ->
              RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
          (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
           to be restarted manually)
  
  
    7.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
  
    8.  Start Link Manager using the option: "TCP/IP
