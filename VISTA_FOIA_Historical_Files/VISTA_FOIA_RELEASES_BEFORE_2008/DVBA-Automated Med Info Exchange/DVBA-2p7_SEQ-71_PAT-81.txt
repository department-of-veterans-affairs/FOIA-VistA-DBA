 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 ISP-1004-N1671   New Skin Disease & Hand, Thumb and Fingers Worksheets
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE worksheets for SKIN DISEASES (OTHER THAN SCARS) and HAND, THUMB,
     AND FINGERS, to change the text in one of the existing paragraphs in
     each worksheet.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA81PI which will deactivate the
         current SKIN DISEASES (OTHER THAN SCARS) and the current HAND,
         THUMB, AND FINGERS worksheets (file 396.6, IENs 180 and 184,
         respectively), and activate the new SKIN DISEASES (OTHER THAN
         SCARS) and the new HAND, THUMB, AND FINGERS worksheets (file
         396.6, IENs 191 and 192, respectively).
     b)  Created routine DVBCWSD5 that contains the text for the new
         SKIN DISEASES (OTHER THAN SCARS) worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWSD4 to access the text routine in b), and
         print the new SKINS DISEASES (OTHER THAN SCARS) worksheet.
     d)  Created routine DVBCWHT7 that contains the text for the new
         HAND, THUMB, AND FINGERS worksheet.
     e)  Created routine DVBCWHT6 to access the text routine in d), and
         print the new HAND, THUMB, AND FINGERS worksheet.
