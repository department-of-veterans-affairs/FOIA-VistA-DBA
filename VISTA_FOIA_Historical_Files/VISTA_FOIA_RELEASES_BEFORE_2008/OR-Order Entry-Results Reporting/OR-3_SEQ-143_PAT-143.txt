  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 Problems and Issues:
 ====================
  
 1. [MAC-0302-61323]  Improvements to order checking performance by 
 caching data into the ^XTMP("OCXCACHE") global.  This data is kept in the 
 cache for 5 minutes then purged the next time ORMTIME is run or a new 
 request for the data occurs.
  
 **************************************************************************
 *                        SPECIAL NOTE!!!                                 *
 *  It is very important that ORMTIME is running when caching is used.    *
 *  ORMTIME cleans out expired data from the cache and will prevent the   *
 *  cache from using up all available disk space.  PURGE^OCXCACHE can be  *
 *  run manually from the programmer's prompt if needed.                  *
 *                                                                        *

 THAN 72 HOURS, UNVERIFIED ORDER, UNVERIFIED MEDICATION ORDER.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
 =========================
 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
 to users.  Users may be on the system during installation. Installation
 will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
    SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
    at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*143):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package OR*3*143.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during install? YES//',
    respond "NO".
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options and 
    Protocols? YES//', respond "NO".
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 9. Please delete all OCXRU* routines on your system.  They are no longer 
    used and cause problems with routine reporting utilities.
