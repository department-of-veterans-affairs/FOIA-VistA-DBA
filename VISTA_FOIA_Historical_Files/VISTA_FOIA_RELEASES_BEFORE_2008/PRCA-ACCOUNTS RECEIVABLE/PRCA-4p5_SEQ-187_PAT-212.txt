 This patch addresses 2 issues.
 
 The first issue is regarding an Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA)
 for the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) deposits appearing on the
 Unapplied EFT Deposits Report which indicated it was not being processed
 although the receipt document showed it was entered on line.
 
 The second issue shows the Other Completed [PRCAD MAS COMPLETE] option
 and the Incomplete [PRCAD MAS INCOMPLETE] option working incorrectly.
 Site received the output which appeared that it found all the bills
 without screening out their services.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
 1. LOU-1103-41099     EDI LOCKBOX UNAPPLIED EFT'S
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The Unapplied EFT Deposits Report shows that the EFT deposits have
    matched to an ERA with a receipt document that has been entered
    on line.  It indicates that the ERA has not been processed in FMS
    when in fact it was.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routine RCDPE8NZ to check the receipt document status for
    the ERA if it was entered On line, then it will not display the EFT
    deposits in the Unapplied EFT Deposits Report
    
 2. PHO-0104-60619     PRCAD MAS INCOMPLETE Not Working Right
  
    Problem:
    -------
    After our site has changed the abbreviation (MAS) of their service
    that has been used to generate only MAS bills in the PRCAD MAS 
    INCOMPLETE report, they did not receive the intended bills with 
    the MAS service only but all the bills during the time the report 
    ran.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routine PRCAMAS to use the MAS SERVICE POINTER field in the 
    IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9) instead of the presence of hard code
    for the ABBREVIATION field in the SERVICE/SECTION file (#49) to find
    the MAS bills. The changes will make the option produce a list of
    MAS bills no matter what the abbreviation has been modified at
    our facilities.
  
 3. An environment check routine will be used to check if site has a
    CoreFLS version of software and recommend not to install this patch
    unless an accompanying update is made to the AR-CoreFLS software
    immediately after installation of this patch.
