  - Routine

Description:
============

 ******************************** N O T E ********************************
 CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with the 
 FB-CoreFLS development team.
 *************************************************************************
  
 Reimbursement Payments for short term authorizations may reject with 
 codes 037 and 038 due to the veteran MRA (Master Record Adjustment) 
 not being sent to Central Fee in Austin.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1. FGH-0104-31721 Payments rejecting in Austin
     
 Problem:
 -------
 Entering reimbursement payments for short term authorizations must always 
 initiate sending veteran MRA (Master Record Adjustment) transactions to
 Central Fee. After the modifications made for HIPAA patch FB*3.5*57, MRA
 transactions are sent to Central Fee only if the patient's permanent or
 confidential address has been changed. Thus, if the user doesn't make
 changes in either of the patient addresses, the veteran MRA message is not
 sent to Austin, and Central Fee will not have the patient address and
 other information about the veteran to complete the reimbursement payment
 transaction. The problem was introduced by patch FB*3.5*57.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The routine FBAACO0 has been modified to send the veteran MRA every time 
 when reimbursement payment is entered for short term authorization.
  
 After the patch is installed, the FB users need to retransmit patient MRA
 for the rejected short term authorization and then re-initiate the 
 payment.
