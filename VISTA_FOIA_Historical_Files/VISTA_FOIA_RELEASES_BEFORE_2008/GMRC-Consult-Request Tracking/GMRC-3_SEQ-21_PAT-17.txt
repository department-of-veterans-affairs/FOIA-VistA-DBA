Description: 
============

 This patch provides enhancements necessary for the interfacing of the
 Clinical Procedures package with Consult/Request Tracking along with some
 general enhancements. 
  
  
 Clinical Procedure Enhancements:
 --------------------------------
 The patch allows the mapping of a procedure from the CP DEFINITION
 (#702.01) file to a procedure in the GMRC PROCEDURE file. Upon mapping the
 two procedure files, subsequent requests for the procedure will be
 processed using the Clinical Procedures package and resulted in the CPRS
 GUI. Clinical Procedures requests may only be resulted using TIU documents
 in the CLINICAL PROCEDURES class.  For complete details of the Clinical
 Procedures interface, refer to the documentation for that package when 
 available.
  
  
 NOTE: This interface will not be functional until CLINICAL PROCEDURES
 version 1.0 is installed. 
  
  
 General Enhancements:
 ---------------------
 1) This patch changes the format used to print TIU documents associated
 with a consult or procedure request. TIU documents printed as part of an
 SF-513 will now match the format of the documents when printed as a
 stand-alone document from TIU.  NOIS BUT-0701-22608
  
 2) The Detailed Display of a procedure request will now display associated
 Medicine results exactly as they are displayed using the Results Display
 action in CPRS.   NOIS CIN-0401-41619
  
 3) Users may now be configured as BOTH administrative update users and
 clinical update user.   If a user is configured in a field that confers
 clinical update user authority and a field that confers administrative
 update authority, the user will be able to complete a consult or procedure
 request using either mechanism. To have this privilege, the user must be
 configured in both fields within the same service.
  
 4) Prior to this patch, users configured only as administrative update
 users were able to update certain consults from the Notes tab of CPRS even
 though they were restricted from doing so on the Consults tab. The
 abilities of these individuals is now consistent on the two tabs. 
 NOIS MIN-0801-42278
  
  
 Data Dictionary Changes:
 ------------------------
  
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file
   A new field, CLINICAL PROCEDURE (#1.01) is added to store the clinical
   procedure associated with the request. In addition to the use for the
   CLINICAL PROCEDURES interface, this field will facilitate reporting of
   number of procedures of a particular type being ordered.
  
   A new INDEX, 'ACP' is exported for file 123 that is an index of the
   CLINICAL PROCEDURE (#1.01) field and the PATIENT NAME (#.02) field.
  
 GMRC PROCEDURE (#123.3) file
   A new field, CLINICAL PROCEDURE (#.04) is added to map the clinical
   procedure from the CP DEFINITION (#702.01) file to a procedure that may
   be requested in CPRS. This field is indexed by a new 'AC' cross-
   reference.
  
  
 Input Template Changes:
 -----------------------
 The GMRC PROCEDURE SETUP input template is modified to include the editing
 of the CLINICAL PROCEDURE (#.04) field when configuring a procedure for
 ordering in CPRS.    This field may NOT be edited until CLINICAL
 PROCEDURES 1.0 is installed.  This input template is invoked when using
 the Setup procedures [GMRC PROCEDURE SETUP] option. 
  
  DOCUMENTATION:
  ==============
  The User Manual and Technical Manual for Consult/Request Tracking
  have been updated to reflect the enhancements provided by this patch.
  
  The following updated documentation (.PDF) files can be retrieved in 
  BINARY format by FTP:
   
    CONSTM.PDF
    CONSUM.PDF 
  
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov    
  
  which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
  location at the following locations.
  
         Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
         Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
         Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
