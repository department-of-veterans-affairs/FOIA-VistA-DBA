Subject: FIX HOSPITAL REVIEW DISPLAY & BATCH STATUS ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues: the Hospital Reviews [IBT EDIT REVIEWS] 
 option has been modified so that the ward is displayed even if the patient 
 is admitted and discharged on the same day, and the Queue Means Test 
 Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP] option has been modified to 
 respect both date and time.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
  
 1. LON-0503-60994    Ward not displayed when completing Hospital Review
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site user reported that the ward is not showing up when they go in to
    the Hospital Reviews [IBT EDIT REVIEWS] option. This problem only occurs
    when the inpatient stay is less than 24 hours.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBTRV to reset the VAINDT variable to equal to the
    admission date/time.
   
 2. PRE-0803-61427
    Problem:
    --------
    A timing issue occurs in the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges
    [IB MT NIGHT COMP] option. When the job runs, the software only checks 
    the date and not the time for any batches that are pending for less than
    one day and alerts the user prematurely to investigate them.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBCEBUL to look at the date/time recorded for each
    batch in a Pending Austin Receipt status for more than one day and 
    send the bulletin out when a full day has truely passed.
