Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 As a follow-up enhancement to Surgery patch SR*3*115, this patch adds a 
 new report option to assist in reviewing compliance with the process 
 defined by directive 2002-070, ENSURING CORRECT SURGERY. Ensuring Correct 
 Surgery Compliance Report [SRO ECS COMPLIANCE] option is added to the 
 Management Reports [SRO-CHIEF REPORTS] menu on the Chief of Surgery Menu
 [SROCHIEF] option. 
  
 This report checks the two fields added to SURGERY file (#130) by Surgery 
 patch SR*3*115, the TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71) and the IMAGING 
 CONFIRMED field (#72). A surgical case is counted as compliant with the 
 documentation process for ensuring correct surgery if the TIME OUT 
 VERIFIED field (#71) is YES and if the IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72) is 
 either YES or NOT APPLICABLE.
  
 This report includes two parts, either of which may be printed separately 
 or combined: 
  1. Compliance Summary - This part shows the number of cases with each of
     the possible data scenarios for the two fields in question and their
     percentage of the total cases performed.
  2. List of Non-Compliant Cases - This part provides a list of surgical
     cases that are not compliant (as defined above).
