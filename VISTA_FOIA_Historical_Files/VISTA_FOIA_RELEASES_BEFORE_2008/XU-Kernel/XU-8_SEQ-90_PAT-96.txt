Description: 
============

  
  PCE              PCE has it's own Location file (#9999999.06) which
                   points to the institution file.  This file needs to
                   be updated whenever a entry is added to or deleted from 
                   the institution file.  The PCE file will be updated 
                   to include all current entries in file 4.
                   See DBIA 1039

        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.

        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.

        options:

           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
