Subject: DSS LAB RESULTS SITE/SPECIMEN EXPANSION 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch implements a request from Decision Support System
 to expand the lab results site/specimen entries to include
 FECES as an additional choice.  At present the only two choices
 are BLOOD and URINE.  The test "Occult Blood" is almost
 always performed on stool (i.e. feces) samples, therefore FECES
 is needed as a possible choice.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*307 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*307 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*307 have no effect on Blood
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 Routine Description:
 ====================
  
 The LRCAPDAR routine was originally designed such that 
 it recognized site/specimen types "BL" for blood and "UR"
 for urine.  To add additional specimens the routine had
 to be modified by adding a new line of code for each
 new specimen.  Each such change required a new LR
 patch.  In an effort to reduce the dependency of DSS on
 the laboratory team, and to make the routine more efficient
 it was decided to generalize the site/specimen definition.
 The new LRCAPDAR routine reads all of the laboratory
 site/specimen values.  All of these values are now stored
 in an array in a format that DSS recognizes.  The DSS
 application can now add specimens as needed without
 incurring any delays resulting from the laboratory team
 development process. 
  
 NOTE: This patch is a companion to the  ECX*3.0*51 patch.
       LR*5.2*307 is not called by any menu option and does not
       have any user interface.  Patch LR*5.2*307 MUST
       be installed for the  ECX*3.0*51 patch to work.
