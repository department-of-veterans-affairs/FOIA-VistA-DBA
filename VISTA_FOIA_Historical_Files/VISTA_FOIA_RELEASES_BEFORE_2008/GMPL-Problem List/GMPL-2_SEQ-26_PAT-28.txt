 **********************************************************************
  
 This patch is part of a combined KIDS build (CSV HDS 1.0) that contains 4 
 Health Data Systems patches to support Code Set Versioning under the
 Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  These
 patches are contained within a single host file: CSV_HDS_1_0.KID
  
  The four patches included in this KIDS build are :
                   GMPL*2.0*28
                   OR*3.0*181
                   GMRC*3.0*33
                   TIU*1.0*161
  
  
 The following changes/enhancements will be made to the Problem List 
 application to make it compliant with Code Set Versioning requirements of 
 HIPAA.
  
 1) Any problems on a patient problem list with inactive ICD9 codes will 
 now display with a # symbol next to them.
  
 2) Problem List will prompt the user to edit problem list entries with 
 codes that are inactive for the current date.   Problem List will use the 
 Lexicon Search Utility and display only diagnoses that have active ICD9 
 codes for the current date.
  
 3) When adding new problems or changing existing problems, Problem List 
 will use the Lexicon Search Utility and display only diagnoses that have 
 active ICD9 codes for the current date.  When the problem is saved, 
 Problem List will evaluate the problem code to ensure that it has an 
 active ICD9 code for the current date.  If the code is not active, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user.
  
 4) When adding problems to a patient problem list, if the user or clinic 
 has a Problem Selection List assigned, Problem List will display only 
 items on the problem selection list that have active ICD9 codes for the 
 current date
  
 5) When adding a comment to a problem, Problem List will evaluate the 
 code associated with the problem.  If the ICD9 code is inactive for the 
 current date, Problem List will prevent entry of a comment, display a 
 message to the user stating that the ICD9 code is not active for the 
 current date and ask the user to edit the problem.
  
 6) When verifying a problem, Problem List will evaluate the code 
 associated with the problem.  If the code is inactive for the current 
 date, Problem List will prevent verification of the problem, display a 
 message to the user stating that the code is not active for the current 
 date, and ask the user to edit the problem.
  
 7) When replacing a removed problem to the active problem list, Problem 
 List will evaluate the code associated with the problem.  If the code is 
 inactive for the current date, Problem List will display a message to the 
 user stating that the code is not active for the current date and then 
 prompt the user to edit the problem.
  
 8) Problem List will evaluate entries on a Problem Selection List and 
 identify problems with inactive ICD9 codes. When building problem 
 selection lists, any problem with an inactive code attached will be 
 followed by "<INACTIVE CODE>".
  
 9) When adding a problem to a Problem Category, Problem List will only 
 allow selection of problems that have active ICD9 codes for the current 
 date.
  
 10) When editing a problem included in a Problem Category, Problem List 
 will only allow selection of active ICD9 codes for the current date.
  
 11) When adding a Problem Category to the Problem Selection List, Problem 
 List will evaluate the Problems assigned to the Problem Category.  If a 
 problem has an inactive ICD9 code, the Problem Category will not be added 
 to the Problem Selection List, an error message advising the user to edit 
 the entries with inactive codes will be presented to the user. 
  
 12) When saving the Problem Selection List, the Problem List will 
 evaluate the problems for active ICD9 codes for the current date.  If an 
 entry has an inactive code, the list will not be saved and an error 
 message advising the user to edit the entries with inactive codes will be 
 presented to the user.
  
 13) When assigning the Problem Selection List to a user or to a clinic, 
 Problem List will evaluate the problems for an active ICD9 code for the 
 current date.  If an entry has an inactive code, the list will not be 
 assigned, and an error message will be displayed to the user.  The error 
 message will state that a problem selection list with an inactive code 
 may not be assigned to a user or a clinic.
  
 14) Problem List exports the GMPL SELECTION LIST CSV EVENT protocol that 
 will subscribe to the new Lexicon Code Set Update Protocol Event Point 
 and to the ICD Code Set Update Protocols.  This protocol will initiate a 
 job that is activated when a new ICD9 code set version is implemented. 
 When a new ICD9 code set version is implemented, Problem List will 
 evaluate the entries in Problem Selection Category Contents file (125.12) 
 for inactive ICD9 codes. Problem List will identify any selection list 
 problem with an ICD9 code that has been inactivated and will generate a 
 report that identifies the Problem Categories and Problem Selection Lists 
 that include problems with inactivated ICD9 codes. Problem List will send 
 a MailMan message to notify members of the GMPL CODE SET VERSION UPDATES 
 mail group of Problem Selection Lists with problems that have inactive 
 ICD9 codes.  The message will include the report that identifies the 
 Problem Categories and Problem Selection Lists that include problems with 
 inactivated codes. The report and mail message will also include a list 
 of problems containing codes scheduled to be inactivated in the future.
  
 15) Problem List has developed a new option to manually initiate 
 evaluation of the PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY CONTENTS file (#125.12) for 
 inactive ICD9 codes.  This option will perform similar actions as the 
 GMPL SELECTION LIST CSV EVENT protocol.  It will be manually initiated 
 rather than electronically triggered. This option will generate a report 
 that identifies the Problem Categories and Problem Selection Lists that 
 include problems with inactivated ICD9 codes as well as a list of 
 problems containing codes scheduled to be inactivated in the future.
