 Patch XM*7.1*189
  
 NOIS: HUN-1100-22076, ALB-0301-52954, CTX-0401-70603
 Test Site:  Central Texas HCS, Northern California HCS
 Sometimes, when a user is editing a reply in one MailMan session, and then
 starts a second MailMan session, the reply message stub is killed by the
 second session.  When the user returns to the first session and sends the
 reply, the reply appears to be from "* No Name *".  This patch detects when
 the stub has been killed, and recreates it.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*177.
