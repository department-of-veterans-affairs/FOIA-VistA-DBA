Subject: UPDATE EXAM DATA TO V/R & PROC CODE ENTRY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues.
      
 1. Currently when editing Radiology Exams, updates to the exam are not
    communicated to the Voice Recognition Systems unless there is an exam
    status change.
     
 2.  When adding Procedure Codes, if you stay within the menu option and
     select an existing procedure code to edit, the system will allow you
     to modify the CPT code. (This should not be allowed.)

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1
 -------
 When an Exam's status is updated, an HL7 message is generated 
 and transmitted to the Voice Recognition Systems.
      
 When editing a Radiology exam, using:
      
 Edit Exam by Patient [RA EDITPT]
 Case No. Exam Edit [RA EDITCN]
 Status Tracking of Exams [RA STATRACK]
      
 The data is updated in VistA but if the exam status is not changed, no
 updates are transmitted to the Voice Recognition Systems such as 
 Talk Station and Power Scribe.
           
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to Radiology routines RAUTL1 AND RASTED to call
 the API EXM^RAHLRPC before determining if the exam status has been updated
 to create the HL7 messages needed to update the Voice Recognition Systems.
      
 Problem #2
 -------
 When adding/updating procedure codes to the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES file 
 (#71) via Procedure Enter/Edit [RA PROCEDURE] option,  VistA currently
 allows editing of the CPT Code of an existing procedure after adding a new
 procedure if the user does not leave the option.  Radiology business rules
 prohibit CPT code editing on existing procedure codes.
      
 Resolution #2
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RAMAIN2 to reinitialize the 
 variable RANEW71 with each procedure code being input or updated.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
           
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
     menu, select the Installation menu.
      
  3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RA*5.0*71)
      
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     RA*5.0*71.
      
  5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
