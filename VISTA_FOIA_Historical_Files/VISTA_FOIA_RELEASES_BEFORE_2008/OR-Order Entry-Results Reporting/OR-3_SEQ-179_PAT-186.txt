Description:
============

 This patch will fix a problem with pharmacy orders being reinstated
 when a patient is readmitted following a discharge from observation.  
 Prior to this patch, it was possible for pharmacy orders to be reinstated 
 when a patient was readmitted following a discharge from observation and
 no active discharge auto-dc rule were in place.  Now, if there is no 
 active discharge auto-dc rule and pharmacy auto-dcs orders upon discharge 
 from an observation admission, the temporary space that holds these 
 orders for possible reinstatement is cleared.
  
 This patch will also fix a problem with orders appearing on the active 
 orders list with more than one status.  If a pharmacy order were placed 
 and finished and then updated multiple times in such a way as to not 
 create a new order, it was possible for the AC cross reference in file 
 100 to have more than one entry.  The AC cross reference indicates active 
 orders and their corresponding action.  When multiple AC cross references 
 are in place an order will appear more than once with the appropriate 
 status based on the action.  A change was made so that the AC cross 
 reference gets updated correctly.  In addition, a change was made so that 
 when orders are displayed the AC cross reference is reviewed to be sure 
 that only the latest, and correct, entry is in place.
  
 Additionally, this patch fixes two problems related to delayed surgery 
 events.  It's possible for delayed orders to be released more than once 
 if the TIME PAT OUT OR field is entered and then immediately edited to a 
 new value.  In addition, it's possible for orders to be rejected by a 
 package if the OPERATING ROOM field for a procedure is not identified.  A 
 change has been made to ensure that a surgery event is only processed one 
 time.  A change has also been made so that the patient's current ward 
 location is used if an operating room has not been entered for the 
 procedure.
  
 A change was made to the detailed display for an order so that the person 
 who marked the order as signed on chart is now shown.  In addition, the 
 date/time the order was marked as signed on chart will show as well.
  
 A problem was identified with NHCU patients who were ASIH to an 
 observation type ward that needed to be followed up for continued care.  
 When the patient went ASIH to observation and then was discharged and 
 then was sent back to ASIH non-observation, the pharmacy orders did not 
 reinstate as expected.  Transfers back TO ASIH following an observational 
 ASIH visit in which the user indicated that the patient would be 
 immediately readmitted will now reinstate pharmacy orders as expected.  
 It's important to note that when a patient is ASIH on a non-observation 
 ward that the receiving site's treating specialty auto-dc rule may be
 invoked if it's active.  All TO ASIH and FROM ASIH movements include a
 treating specialty change.  As a result, even a FROM ASIH movement may
 invoke the treating specialty rule if it's active as treating specialty
 changes always over-ride.  When the patient is ASIH on an observation
 ward, then the receiving site's FROM ASIH auto-dc rule will take
 precedence.  You will want to review your FROM ASIH set-up to be sure 
 that the correct orders are auto-dcd in this case.

 WPB-0902-31431     LIST DUP IN CPRS
 MOU-0302-32622     Orders displaying in two statuses
  
 The AC cross reference should only have one entry per order.  It was 
 discovered that multiple AC cross reference entries could exist under 
 unusual circumstances.  The AC cross reference is now set correctly under 
 the identified scenario.
  
 UNY-0403-11545     AUTODISCONTINUE Not working always
 For observation patients who have active pharmacy orders and there is no 
 active discharge auto-dc rule, it is possible to have pharmacy orders 
 reinstate upon readmission, which is incorrect.  A check is now made to 
 see if there is an active discharge auto-dc rule.  If there is not then 
 the temporary space holding the pharmacy orders to be reinstated is 
 deleted.
  
 HWH-0503-40688     Duplicate orders from order set
 If the TIME PAT OUR OR field is entered and then immediately changed, 
 it's possible for two processes to be running that will release and/or 
 auto-dc orders.  A flag is now set so that once processing of a surgery 
 event begins, no other process can attempt to work with the same surgery 
 event.
  
 BHH-0403-40376     Delayed orders for O.R. causes radiology orders to 
                    cancel
 When the TIME PAT OUR OR field is filled in and an active surgery event 
 is processed, the OPERATING ROOM field is used to determine the location 
 to print the orders to (if defined) and is used as the ordering location 
 for the order.  Depending on the package and the setup of the OPERATING 
 ROOM field it's possible for orders to be rejected.  In addition, if the 
 OPERATING ROOM field is undefined, it's possible that an order could end 
 up with no ordering location, which can also cause orders to be 
 rejected.  A change has been made so that the OPERATING ROOM will be used 
 to determine where to print orders to.  If no OPERATING ROOM is defined 
 then the patient's current ward location will be used to determine where 
 the orders print.  In either case, the patient's current ward location 
 will be used as the ordering location.
  
 MAC-0403-60380     Unsigned orders released as signed on chart
 When an order is signed as "signed on chart" the user who released the 
 order with this signature status is not show in the order's detailed 
 display.  For this type of order, the "released by" line now indicates 
 who released it and when.
  
 LEX-0503-40797     Meds didn't auto dc after specialty transfer
 When a patient is returning to the NHCU after being ASIH to an 
 observation ward, the FROM ASIH auto-dc rule at the receiving site will 
 be invoked.  In this case, the site did not have an active FROM ASIH rule 
 and therefore orders were not auto-dcing as expected.  In addition, 
 pharmacy orders were not being reinstated upon readmission to ASIH on a 
 non-observation ward.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
 =========================
 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
 to users.  Users may be on the system during installation. Installation
 will take less than 1 minute.
  
 *NOTE: Sites should review the setup of their FROM ASIH auto-dc rule.  
 When a patient is ASIH on an observation ward and is subsequently 
 discharged, the receiving site's FROM ASIH rule will be invoked.  When a 
 patient is ASIH to a non-observation ward then the receiving site's 
 TREATING SPECIALTY auto-dc rule is invoked (if it's active); otherwise,
 the FROM ASIH auto-dc rule will be used.  It's important to review the
 FROM ASIH and TREATING SPECIALTY auto-dc rules to be sure they were
 working as you expect them to.
