Description: 
============

  DESCRIPTION:
  =============
   
  This patch addresses 3 problems with RPC Broker v1.1
   
  Encrypted Literal:
   A leading period (".") in a LITERAL parameter can cause a pattern match
   failure in RPCs. This type of literal is common when data is encrypted.
   The failure only occurs with RPCs which combine multiple literals and an
   array.  This fix addresses the needs of NOIS WAS-0398-22800
   
  Data Collection Switch:
   The original version of the broker automatically collected Response Time
   data.  This was done to fulfill a request from Capacity Management since
   at the time, no baseline data existed for Vista client-server
   Applications.  The broker will not do this any longer.  Collection will
   be ontrolled by the use of the Capacity Management tools, allowing the
   site to decide when to turn data collection on or off. This fix addresses
   the needs of NOIS BRX-0498-11768 and HUN-0498-21137.
   
  ***NOTE:
   The Capacity Management option "Enable/Disable RT Logging" looks at the
   old Kernel Site Parameters file instead of the new Kernel System
   Parameters file.  So, using this option will not enable/disable the RTM.
   The Capacity Management team is aware of this and are going to issue a
   patch.  In the meantime, a site has to use FileMan to manually turn the
   RTM on/off in file 8989.3 (Kernel System Parameter).  The field is the
   LOG SYSTEM RT and its within the VOLUME SET multiple.
   
   Example:
   Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
         Select KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS DOMAIN NAME: 1 KERNEL.ISC-SF.VA.GOV
                 Select VOLUME SET: KDE// 
                         LOG SYSTEM RT?: NO// Y  YES  <<==
   
   
  10 Second Network Timeout in Client Agent:
   A 30 second timeout is being switched to 10 for network communications
   with client agent.  In the event of network problems, this should prevent
   delays  to exceed minutes in communications between the server and the
   workstation client agent.  No current NOIS addresses this, this effect
   was discovered by the SF CIOFO.
   
   
  ==========================================================================
   
   INSTALLATION:
   
   
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines MAY BE mapped, so you will need
       to disable mapping for the effected routines.  Broker routines do not
       need to be mapped.
   
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
   
           Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
   
   4.  All RPC Broker users should log off.
       Since no changes are made to the main server routines, sites do not
       need to shut down the listener jobs, BUT sites may choose to do if it
       make it easier to control users trying to log on during the routine
       update.
   
   
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
          Install Package(s)  'XWB*1.1*2'
                               =========
   
   6.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
       other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
   
   7.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
   
   8.  Restart the Broker Listener if necessary.
