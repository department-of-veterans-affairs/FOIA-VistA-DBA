Subject: PRE INSTALLATION PATCH FOR PSB*2*6

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Install this patch before installing Patch PSB*2*6. It will perform the 
 same medication order validation as Patch PSB*2*6, and allows Pharmacists 
 an opportunity to review "problem" medication orders before your site 
 installs PSB*2*6. Ensure that PSB*2*6, is installed immediately following 
 the correction of any problem medication orders. Failure to do so may 
 result in medication orders not displaying on the Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
 The person installing this patch will receive two separate MailMan 
 messages with the following subjects: 
 
 BCMA Order Problem Notification Started on JAN 7,2003@08:24:18.
 This will let the user know the date and time the process started.
 
 BCMA Order Problem Notification Finished on JAN 7,2003@08:30:47.
 This will let the user know the date and time the process finished.
 
 The person installing this patch will also receive a MailMan message
 with the subject: BCMA Pre patch 6 - Order Problem Notification. This will
 let the user know that PSB*2*6 will have a problem displaying an order, 
 which is identified in the message text. A separate MailMan message
 will be generated for each Order Problem. Please coordinate with pharmacy 
 to correct the order with the problem.

         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
