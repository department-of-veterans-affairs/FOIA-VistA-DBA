Subject: ACTION DISPLAY FOR PXCE ENCOUNTER AND APPOINTMENT MGT MODULE

Category: 
  - Print Template

Description:
============

 There are three issues being resolved:
 1. The top portion of the Action display for PXCE Encounter is
    scrolling off the screen and either dropping one or two action 
    lines.
  
 2. The top portion of the Action display for Appointment Mgt Module is
    scrolling off the screen and either dropping one or two action
    lines.
  
 3. The TI - Display Team Information action description in the PXE 
    Encounter menu was too long and was printing continously to another
    action description, HS Health Summary.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 NJH-0901-21890  Action menu on List Manager screens not displaying 
                 correctly 
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Action display for PXCE Encounter Update and Appointment Mgt Module not 
 displaying alll action items for PXCE Encounter update and Appt Mgt 
 module.  Also, the 'TI' action description was too long for allowable 
 description space allotment.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 This patch modifies the bottom margin for action functions to allow all 
 of the action keys/descriptors to display without scrolling action lines 
 off the screen.  Also, the TI - Display Team Information action on PXCE 
 Encounter update is changed to TI - Display Team Info.
  
 ************ NOTE *********************** NOTE ***************
  
 The bottom margin had to be set to allow for a maximum of seven (7)
 action lines as a national guideline.  For those sites with less
 than seven (7) lines of actions you will need to modify the BOTTOM
 MARGIN accordingly:
  
 To correct the bottom margin to eliminate your "extra" line(s) after 
 the SELECT ACTION line and prevent actions scrolling off action area:
     
  
       Using FileMan edit using the following script:
  
 MNT,VBB>D P^DI
  
 VA FileMan 22.0
  
 Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: NEW PERSON// LIST TEMPLATE    (509 entries)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// BOTTOM MARGIN  
 THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
 Select LIST TEMPLATE NAME: PXCE MAIN MENU  
 BOTTOM MARGIN: 15// *******
  
 Select LIST TEMPLATE NAME: PXCE SDAM
      1   PXCE SDAM MENU  
      2   PXCE SDAM VIEW ONLY  
 CHOOSE 1-2: 1  PXCE SDAM MENU
 BOTTOM MARGIN: 15//  *******
  
 ******  Depending on the number of action lines you have you need to do 
 the following:  
                1.  For 5 action lines change BOTTOM MARGIN to 17
                2.  For 6 action lines change BOTTOM MARGIN to 16
                3.  For 7 action lines change BOTTOM MARGIN to 15
