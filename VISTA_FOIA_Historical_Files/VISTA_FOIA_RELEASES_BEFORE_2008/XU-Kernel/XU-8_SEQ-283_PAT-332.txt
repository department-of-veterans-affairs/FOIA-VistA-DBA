Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   When Menu Option: Automatic Deactivation of Users[XUAUTODEACTIVATE] 
 is run and either a user is terminated or DISUSERed, a change event task 
 is created to notify other VistA packages of this change in the status of
 the user.  The problem is that Kernel is creating this task for previously
 DISUSERed users, thus causing many, many unnecessary tasks.  After this
 patch, only new DISUSERed users will have a task created for them.
  
  E3R #14822, AUDIT REACTIVATIONS
  This request concerns auditing of terminated users.  This E3R was 
 approved and three(3) new options were created:
   ISO's Terminated User Report[XUSEC ISO TERMINATION REPORT]
   Queueable ISO Terminated User Report[XUSEC ISO Q TERMINATION REPORT]
   Up Arrow Delimited Termination Report[XUSEC UP ARROW TERM REPORT]
