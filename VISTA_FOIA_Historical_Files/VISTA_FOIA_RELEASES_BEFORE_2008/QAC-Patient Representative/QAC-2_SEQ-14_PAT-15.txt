        --------------------------
        NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
               NAME, enter QAC*2.0*15):
       
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
      
   6.   Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
                                    ----------------
         (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter QAC*2.0*15)
        **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch: 
    
        a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch
            install.
        b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion
            of Install', respond NO as long as the menu trees are
            re-built regularly. There is one new option and two additions
            to menus, but re-building the menu trees adds considerably to
            the time of the installation.
        c.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
            YES//' answer NO.

            Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer NO.
  
  
 8.  ENABLE MAPPING
     --------------
     If any routines were unmapped as a part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once  the installation has run to
     completion.
