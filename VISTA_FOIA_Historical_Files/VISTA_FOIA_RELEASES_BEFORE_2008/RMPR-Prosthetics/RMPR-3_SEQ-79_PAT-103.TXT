 Description:
 ============
 A multidisciplinary team had a conference call on May 4, 2004, to discuss
 issues raised in the 4/21/04 issue paper titled "Prosthetic NIF Stakeholder
 Workgroup Findings".  The group consisted of representatives from the
 Prosthetics Program Office, Chief Logistics Office, VISTA interface developers
 for Prosthetics and IFCAP, the NIF Program Manager, and the COTR for the NIF
 contractor.
  
 During this call, it was decided that the group needed to adopt a phased 
 approach to the issues: 1) develop a short term solution to fix the data 
 currently corrupt at Bay Pines as a result of IFCAP Patch 63; and 2) 
 develop a long-term solution that would best resolve the issues raised by 
 Prosthetics to ensure quality data was being captured and successful NIF 
 implementation.
  
 It is the recommendation of the Prosthetics NIF Workgroup to provide HCPCS
 Server functionality to allow the Prosthetic Clinical Management (PCM) staff
 the ability to automatically update the PSAS HCPCS file 661.1 without the need
 for yearly software patches.  Following is the list of the needed
 functionality that the PCM staff will be able to send the Sites through
 the Server Activation:
  
 1.)    Add a New PSAS HCPCS
 2.)    Edit the NPPD New Code
 3.)    Edit the NPPD Repair Code
 4.)    Edit the Status
 5.)    Edit the Short Name
 6.)    Edit the Calculation Flag
 7.)    Edit the Description
  
 A mail message will be sent to a standard local VistA Mail Group with 
 regards to which HCPCS, date, and by whom to inform the Prosthetics staff 
 of the changes. The mail group name is:  RMPR SERVER
  
 Prosthetics staff will no longer wait 3-6 months for the file to be 
 updated.  This also ensures valid data for billing purposes.
  
 Four new data fields are included in the NPPD rollup for FPDS reporting 
 purposes.  The TAX/ID SSN, SSN/TAX ID INDICATOR, DUN & BRADSTREET # and
 BUSINESS TYPE associated with the IFCAP Vendor selected for each Line Item 
 as defined in the Vendor File #440.
