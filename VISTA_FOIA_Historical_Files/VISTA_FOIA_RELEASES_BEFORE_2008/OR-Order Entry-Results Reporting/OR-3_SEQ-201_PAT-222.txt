Description:
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 
 This patch, in conjunction with GroupNotes.exe, was designed to assist
 providers in documenting group therapy sessions and events such as
 immunization clinics. It allows the easy assembly of patient groups based on
 Clinics, Specialties, Wards, Teams, or Provider lists. It then allows the note
 author to specify parts of a note that apply to the entire group and parts
 that apply to individuals. It does the same with encounter data. After the
 note and encounter information is complete, it provides for a single signature 
 for the entire group.
