 PATCH OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 Patch EC*2*60 modifies the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE File (#725).  These
 changes were submitted by the BTSO DSS Program Office to be implemented
 upon release of the patch.  This patch adds 4 new codes, modifies 3
 description names and inactivates 1 code in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file #725.
 
 (1) The new entries to be made to file #725 are:
     Natl #      Description                            CPT Code
     ------      -----------                            --------
     SP497       SPEECH GEN DEVICE, DIGITIZED 8-20 M   
     SP498       SPEECH GEN DEVICE, DIGITIZED 20-40 M  
     SP499       SPEECH GEN DEVICE, DIGITIZED >40 M    
     SP500       THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY                   97530
    
 (2) The updated description name to be made to file #725 are:
     Natl #  Description                     	  New description name
     ------  ----------                     	  --------------------
     SP112   VOICE PROSTHESIS EVAL, LEVEL 1 	  VOICE PROSTH EVAL/FITTING,
 						  LVL1
     SP327   VOICE PROSTHESIS EVALUATION,LEVEL 2   VOICE PROSTH EVAL/FITTING,
                                                   LVL2
     SP328   VOICE PROSTHESIS EVALUATION, LEVEL 3  VOICE PROSTH EVAL/FITTING,
                                                   LVL3
 
 (3) The entries to be inactivated in file #725 are:
     Natl #  Description                           Inactive Date
     ------  -----------                           -------------
     SP457   SPEECH GEN DEV, DIGITIZED, > 8 MIN    070103
 
 (4) Once the updates to file #725 have been completed, the patch performs
 
     an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3). Any ACTIVE
     Event Code Screen which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE
     (file #725) record or to an inactive CPT (file #81) record will be
     identified.
  
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user performing the patch installation.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
  
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*60 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
  
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
  
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
  
     The CPT Procedure for the following Event Code Screen (500-3-4-245) 
     is inactive or will soon be inactive --
     Location:  ALBANY
     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: FOCUSED COGNITIVE EVALUATION, LEVEL 1 (SP019)
     Inactivation Date: Feb 01, 2004
  
     The CPT procedure for the following Event
     Code Screen (500-3-4-90844) is inactive --
     Location:  ALBANY
     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: PSYCHOTHERAPY, 45-50 MIN. (90844)
     2 Event Code Screens were found to be pointing to an inactive
     or soon to be inactive procedure in file #725 or file #81.
