  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Introduction
 ============
 Ambulatory Care Messaging Phase II project is a follow-up to Phase I (released
 patches SD*5.3*387 and DG*5.3*617). The request for this project initially 
 came as a recommendation from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Physician
 Productivity and staffing advisory group. It originated as a report of the 
 specialty care subcommittee, which was submitted to the Secretary through the 
 Undersecretary for Health on October 1, 2003. It developed out of a Deputy 
 Undersecretary of Health request for workload information on primary care and 
 specialty care physicians. 
  
 Patch SD*5.3*466 addresses the following changes:
   o  Modifications were made to inpatient encounters to duplicate the 
      checkout requirements as implemented for outpatient encounters that 
      are transmitted via Ambulatory Care transmission to the National Patient
      Care Database (NPCD) in Austin. The exception to this requirement is
      that the classification questions, i.e., service connected, agent orange,
      etc., will not be required for inpatients.
   o  Modifications were made to the Ambulatory Care transmission to include 
      statistics of inpatients transmitted on the "Transmission Completion 
      Bulletin".
   o  New VistA, IP0-IP9, reports were created to match Austin's IP0-IP9 
      reports in order to validate inpatient encounters that are transmitted 
      to the Austin Automation Center (AAC).
   o  Ambulatory Care Reporting Project (ACRP) reports were modified to 
      incorporate/display inpatient encounters using the same logic as 
      outpatient encounters.
  
   
                    MODIFICATIONS TO INPATIENT CHECKOUT
 Technical
 ---------
 o  The following routines were modified to require data for the checkout 
    completion process for inpatients.
        SDCO3    Provider
        SDCO4    Diagnosis
        SDCOM    Checks if "check-out" process is complete
 o  Routine SDAMQ3 was modified to ensure inpatients follow the same checkout
    validations as outpatients when running the schedule background job, 
    Appointment Status Update (Background) [SDAM BACKGROUND JOB].
 o  Routine SDAM1 was modified to allow three new print/display statuses for 
    inpatient encounters as follows:-
        INPATIENT/ACT REQ
        INPATIENT/NO ACT TAKN
        INPATIENT/FUTURE
    These statuses will be displayed in Scheduling Appointment Management and 
    the PCE Appointment List. It is important to note that the inpatient
    status displayed in the PCE Encounter List was not changed; therefore, the 
    PCE Appointment List and the PCE Encounter List will not match. Inpatient 
    appointments will only display the status (ACT REQ, NO ACT TAKN, FUTURE) 
    under the Appointment List view in PCE.  
    The add/edit appointment display in Appointment Management is similar to 
    the PCE Encounter List display and does not indicate if further action is 
    needed for these inpatient encounters.  In order to identify deficiencies 
    for the add/edits, or encounters, the EARR should be run.
   
 Functional
 ----------
 o  The Check Out process for inpatients will not be completed if providers, 
    diagnosis, and procedures are not entered.
 o  When making an appointment if the following message is observed, please
    ensure patch MAG*3.0*84 is installed.
                Unknown Status: "INPATIENT/FUTURE"
                Please notify the Imaging Project
    
    
                       MODIFICATIONS TO AMBCARE TRANSMISSION
 Technical
 ---------
 o  Routines SCDXMSG, SCDXMSG2 and SCMSVUT2 were modified to keep track of 
    inpatient transmission statistics and to include inpatient encounters in 
    the Transmission Completion Bulletin.
  
 Functional
 ---------
 o  The Transmission Completion Bulletin now includes inpatient statistics as
    shown below:

                        NEW IP9 REPORTS (IP0 - IP9)
 Technical
 ---------
 o  Routines SCRPW51 and SCRPW52 were modified to add inpatients so as to 
    generate the new report, Enc. by IP DSS ID/DSS ID by Freq. (IP0, IP1, IP2) 
    [SCRPW DVM IP DSS ID REPORTS].
 o  Routine SCRPW54 was modified to add inpatients so as to generate the new 
    report, Means Test IP Visits & Uniques (IP3, IP4, IP5) [SCRPW DVM IP MEANS 
    TEST SUM].
 o  Routine SCRPW56 was modified to add inpatients so as to generate the new
    report, Most Frequent 50 IP CPT Codes (IP6) [SCRPW DVM IP CPT FREQUENCY].
 o  Routine SCRPW57 was modified to add inpatients so as to generate the new
    report, Most Frequent 50 IP ICD-9-CM Codes (IP7) [SCRPW DVM IP DX FREQUENCY].
 o  Routine SCRPW58 was modified to add inpatients so as to generate the new
    report, Most Frequent 20 IP Practitioner Types (IP8) [SCRPW DVM IP PRACT 
    TYPE FREQ].
 o  Routine SCRPW59 was modified to add inpatients so as to generate the new
    report, Visits and Unique IP SSNs by County (IP9) [SCRPW DVM IP STATS BY 
    COUNTY].
 o  The following six menu options were created with an ENTRY ACTION setting 
    SDSTA=8 for inpatients.
    -  SCRPW DVM IP DSS ID REPORTS      -  SCRPW DVM IP DX FREQUENCY
    -  SCRPW DVM IP MEANS TEST SUM      -  SCRPW DVM IP PRACT TYPE FREQ
    -  SCRPW DVM IP CPT FREQUENCY       -  SCRPW DVM IP STATS BY COUNTY
 o  The Data Validation Menu [SCRPW DATA VALIDATION MENU] was modified to 
    include the six new inpatient options. The description was also changed to 
    reflect both inpatients and outpatients.
   
 Functional
 ----------
 o  The new reports (IP0-IP9) are available under the Data Validation Menu 
    [SCRPW DATA VALIDATION MENU] option as shown below.

                        MODIFICATIONS TO ACRP REPORTS
 Technical
 ---------
 o  Routines SCRPW16 and SCRPW18 were modified to include inpatient encounters 
    in the Encounter 'Action Required' Report [SCRPW ACTION REQUIRED REPORT].
 o  Routines SCRPW8 and SCRPW9 were modified to include inpatient encounters
    in the Outpatient Encounter Work load Statistics [SCRPW OUT ENC WORKLOAD 
    STATS] report.
 o  Routines SCRPW7 and SCRPW8 were modified to include inpatient encounters
    in the Patient Encounter List [SCRPW LIST PT ENCOUNTERS] report.
 o  Routine SCRPW6 was modified to include inpatient encounters in the Trend 
    of Facility Uniques by 12 Month Date Ranges [SCRPW TREND FACILITY UNIQUES] 
    report.
 o  Routine SCRPW6 was modified to include inpatient encounters in the 
    Retroactive Visits List [SDAM RPT RETROACTIVE LIST] report.
  
    
 Functional
 ----------
 o  The following reports from ACRP Reports Menu [SCRPW ACRP REPORTS MENU]
    were changed to include inpatient encounters in their output:
    - Encounter 'Action Required' Report [SCRPW ACTION REQUIRED REPORT]
    - Outpatient Encounter Workload Statistics [SCRPW OUT ENC WORKLOAD STATS]
    - Patient Encounter List [SCRPW LIST PT ENCOUNTERS]
    - Retroactive Visits List [SDAM RPT RETROACTIVE LIST]
    - Trend of Facility Uniques by 12 Month Date Ranges [SCRPW TREND 
      FACILITY UNIQUES]
 o  It is important to note that the names of the options and reports for 
    those that have been modified to include inpatient data, as shown above, 
    have not been changed at this time.  For example, the name of the 
    Outpatient Encounter Workload Statistics [SCRPW OUT ENC WORKLOAD STATS] 
    report remains the same; however, the output contains inpatient and 
    outpatient data.
 o  A new field, STATUS, was added to the 'Action Required' Report [SCRPW 
    ACTION REQUIRED REPORT]. This field differentiates between outpatient and
    inpatient encounters. Outpatient encounters display on the report with
    a status of "ACTION REQUIRED" and inpatients with a status of "INPATIENT 
    APPOINTMENT".
