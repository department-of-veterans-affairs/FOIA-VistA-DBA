Subject: TIU E-SIG DISPLAY ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

     This patch modifies the display of the signature block for notes in 
 CPRS GUI, CPRS List Manager and TIU applications.  The first change causes 
 the Cosignature block to appear below the Signature block.  Previously, the 
 Cosignature block was displayed directly to the right of the Signature 
 block.  This format caused the name and title sections of the 
 Signature/Cosignature blocks to be truncated to 35 characters.  In file 200 
 the acceptable maximum length for the signature name and title fields is 50 
 characters.  Displaying the Cosignature block below the Signature block 
 allows all 50 characters to display if necessary.  
     The second change deals with notes that are "Marked signed on chart."  
 Before this patch, the only indication that a note was signed on the chart 
 was the presence of the /s/ displayed before the name in the signature 
 block.  This patch causes the signature block to show "Marked signed on 
 chart by: " followed by the name of the user that set the note as signed on 
 chart.
     A third change causes the print version of the note signature block to 
 match the online version when a note has been "signed for" another user.
 Previously, the print version would show the Author and then below display 
 the signature block of the user that signed the note for the Author.  Now 
 the print version displays the signature block of the user that signed for 
 the Author followed by "for" and then the Author's Name and Title line.
