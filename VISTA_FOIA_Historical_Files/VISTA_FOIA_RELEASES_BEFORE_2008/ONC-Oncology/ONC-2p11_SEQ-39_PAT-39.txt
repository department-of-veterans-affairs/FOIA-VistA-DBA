 This patch includes the following modifications and problem resolutions:
  
  1) SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT (#165.5,60)
      SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE (#165.51,.04)
 
     a) The SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT field SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE was 
     not displaying correctly.  This has been fixed.
 
     b) If the case had a DATE OF NO TREATMENT the registrar was unable to 
     enter a SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE code.  This has been fixed.
 
  2) CLASS OF CASE/DATE DX/DATE OF FIRST CONTACT inter-field edit check
 
     WARNING: CLASS OF CASE = 2 (Dx ew, 1st tx here)
           DATE OF FIRST CONTACT..:
            earlier than
           DATE DX................:
 
     The CLASS OF CASE/DATE DX/DATE OF FIRST CONTACT inter-field edit check 
     was originally designed to compare DATE DX with DATE OF INPATIENT 
     ADMISSION.  When DATE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION was discontinued with FORDS,
     this edit check was changed to compare DATE DX with DATE OF FIRST CONTACT.
     This was incorrect.   A DATE OF FIRST CONTACT may precede a DATE DX.  This 
     inter-field edit check has been removed.
   
  3) FOLLOW-UP RATE FOR ALL PATIENTS (LIVING AND DEAD)
     [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
      [RS Registry Summary Reports]
       [F Follow-Up]
 
     In accordance with Cancer Program Standards 3.4 and 3.5 the
     follow-up rate may be calculated from the cancer registry reference 
     date or for all patients diagnosed within the last five years.
 
     The [F Follow-up] option has been modified to compute the follow-up 
     rate in accordance with either Standard 3.4 or 3.5.  The registrar will
     be asked to choose which follow-up rate calculation parameter to use.
 
  4) TNM Edition Number [1060] 593-594
 
     The TNM EDITION NUMBER value for the STATE EXTRACT V10.1 and VACCR 
     EXTRACT V10.1 NAACCR extracts was incorrect for Sixth Edition (2003+)
     cases.  This was been fixed.  The ACD (Annual Call for Data) EXTRACT
     V10.1 value was already correct.
    
  5) [ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...]
      [MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts]
       [4 Incidence Report]
        [6 QA-10% Completed abstracts]
  
     a) The Incidence Report was not displaying the DATE DX (#165.5,3) or 
        DATE CASE COMPLETED (#165.5, 90) values correctly.  This has been fixed.
 
     b) The 10% QA REPORT-3 worksheet was not displaying the SOCIAL SECURITY
        NUMBER (#165.5, .09) correctly.  This has been fixed.  
  
  6) [ANN *..Annual Reports ...]
      [AST Annual Site/ICDO Topography/Histology (80c)]
 
     The [AST Annual Site/ICDO Topography/Histology (80c)] option was not
     functioning correctly.  It was judged to be no longer need and has been
     deleted.
 
  7) SURGICAL APPROACH (R) (#165.5,74)
     
     For 1998+ LYMPH NODES (C77.0-C77.9) cases the registrar was unable to
     enter any values for SURGICAL APPROACH (R).  This has been fixed.
 
  8) RX Summ--Surg Prim Site [1290] 859-860
     RX Hosp--Surg Prim Site  [670] 457-458 
 
     For UNKNOWN PRIMARY (C80.9) and HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM NOS (C42.4) cases
     the RX Summ--Surg Prim Site [1290] and RX Hosp--Surg Prim Site [670] 
     NAACCR items were not being extracted correctly.  This has been fixed. 
 
  9) TUMOR SIZE (#165.5,29)
 
     TUMOR SIZE was allowing the entry of alphabetic characters (e.g. BIG).
     This was incorrect.  Only numeric values are allowable.  This has been
     fixed.
 
 10) NOIS MEM-0304-70799 (surg of prim site won't show when print brief 
     abstract)
 
     [ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...]
       [BA Print Abstract-Brief (80c)]
     
     The [BA Print Abstract-Brief (80c)] option was still referencing SURGERY
     OF PRIMARY SITE (R) (#165.5,58.2).  It should reference SURGERY OF PRIMARY
     SITE (F) (#165.5,58.6).  This has been fixed.
 
 11) New Utility Options
 
     Two new options have been added to [UTL *..Utility Options ...] menu:
  
     [CDD1 Print Condensed DD--Oncology Patient file]
     [CDD2 Print Condensed DD--Oncology Primary file]
 
     These options will allow the registrar to print Condensed Data
     Dictionaries of the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (#160) and ONCOLOGY PRIMARY
     (#165.5) files.
 
 12) Primary Menu Options
 
     If the registrar entered "A" at the "Enter option: All//" prompt the
     application would abort with an "undefined variable ONCOANS" error.
     This has been fixed.
 
 13) NAACCR extract v10.1
 
     a) For an unknown or ill-defined primary site (C76.0 C76.8, C80.9) or 
        for hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or
        myeloproliferative disease (C42.0, C42.1, C42.3, C42.4), the 
        following NAACCR v10.1 items were not being extracted correctly:
 
        RX Hosp--Scope Reg 98-02   [747] 480-480
        RX Hosp--Surg Oth 98-02    [748] 481-481
        RX Summ--Surgical Approch [1310] 865-865
        RX Summ--Reconstruct 1st  [1330] 867-867
        RX Summ--Scope Reg 98-02  [1647] 941-941
        RX Summ--Surg Oth 98-02   [1648] 942-942
 
        This has been fixed.
 
     b) For the following NAACCR v10.1 items all special characters will be
        stripped from the extracted data:
 
        Addr Current--City      [1810] 1307-1326
        Follow-Up Contact--City [1842] 1357-1376
 
 14) Additional "required" fields for abstract completion
 
     The following fields must now be filled in prior to setting the 
     ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91) to "Complete":
 
     NUMBER OF TXS TO THIS VOLUME (#165.5,56)
     RADIATION TREATMENT VOLUME   (#165.5,125)
     LOCATION OF RADIATION TX     (#165.5,126)
     REGIONAL TREATMENT MODALITY  (#165.5,363)
 
 15) SURGICAL MARGINS (#165.5,59)
 
     FORDS (page 137)                                                        
     Instructions for Coding SURGICAL MARGINS:
 
     "For lymphomas (M-9590-9596, 9650-9719, 9727-9729) with a lymph node
     primary site (C77.0-C77.9), code 9.
 
     For an unknown or ill-defined primary site (C76.0-C76.8, C80.9) or for
     hematopoietic, reticuloendothelial, immunoproliferative, or 
     myeloproliferative disease (C42.0, C42.1, C42.3, C42.4, or M-9750,
     9760-9764, 9800-9820, 9826, 9831-9920, 9931-9964, 9980-9989), code 9."
 
     Any cases which match the above criteria have had their SURGICAL 
     MARGINS value converted to 9 (Unknown or NA).
 
 16) TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5,71)
 
     In the ROADS-to-FORDS conversion some TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE values 
     were incorrectly set to 99 (Unknown if recurred or disease-free).  These 
     values have been fixed using the following logic:
 
     If STATUS                   = 0 (Dead) and
        CANCER STATUS            = 1 (No evidence of this cancer) and
        TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE = 99 (Unknown if recurred or disease-free)
     Then TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE has been changed to 00 (None, disease-free)
 
     If STATUS                   = 0 (Dead) and
        CANCER STATUS            = 2 (Evidence of this cancer) and
        TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE = 99 (Unknown if recurred or disease-free)
     Then TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE has been changed to 70 (Never disease-free)
 
     In both instances the DATE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5,70) has also been 
     set to 00/00/0000.
 
 17) TENNESSEE VALLEY HCS
 
     a) The following entry has been added to the FACILITY (#160.19) file:
 
        10000175 TENNESSEE VALLEY HCS
 
     b) The pointers to the 6521070 (NASHVILLE VA MEDICAL CENTER) and 
        6520930 (MURFREESBORO VA MEDICAL CENTER) FACILITY entries have been 
        re-pointed to the 10000175 (TENNESSEE VALLEY HCS) entry.
 
     c) The 6521070 (NASHVILLE VA MEDICAL CENTER) and 6520930 (MURFREESBORO 
        VA MEDICAL CENTER) entries have been deleted from the FACILITY 
        (#160.19) file.
