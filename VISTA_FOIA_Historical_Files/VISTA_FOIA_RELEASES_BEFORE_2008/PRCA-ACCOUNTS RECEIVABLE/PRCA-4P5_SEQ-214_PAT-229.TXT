Subject: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SHUT DOWN FOR PFSS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented 
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing 
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".  The 
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at 
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 patch.

 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

  Functional Description:
  =======================
 Each month the Debt Management Center (DMC) process selects Accounts 
 Receivable (AR) debt to be referred to the DMC. In addition, each month 
 the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) process selects AR debt to be referred 
 to the TOP.
  
 In both cases, the current process for selecting AR debt excludes debt 
 that is less than twenty-five dollars. The DMC and TOP monthly processes 
 are being changed to select all AR debt, even when that debt is less than 
 twenty-five dollars. 
  
 Patch PRCA*4.5*229 removes the filtering of debt under the twenty-five 
 dollar amount to permit that debt to be sent to the DMC and the TOP, 
 respectively. If the PFSS switch is turned "ON", all positive debt, 
 regardless of its amount, will be sent to the DMC and to the TOP.  
   
 Both the DMC- and TOP-process messages will be sent to the new VistA 
 Interface Engine (VIE) Aggregator. Rejections will be processed on both 
 VistA and the COTS billing system--regardless of the originating system. 
 Since the interface message data does not identify the originating 
 system, any COTS-created debtor IDs that did not exist on VistA will 
 appear on the VistA AR Invalid Debtor ID Error Report. 
  
 Prior to this patch, the TOP-receiving server (RCTOPS) expected all 
 DEBTOR IDs to be on the VistA system.  An enhancement to RCTOPS will 
 allow VistA to "ignore" any rejection messages from TOP that, while 
 generated from the COTS billing system, were NOT in VistA.
  
 For more information on the requirements for the TOP messaging of the 
 dual feeds from VistA and the COTS billing system, refer to the Austin 
 Data Translation Services Assessment for Financial Services Center (FSC) 
 and Austin Interfaces.
