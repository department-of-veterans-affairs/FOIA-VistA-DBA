Subject: CREATE 132 COLUMN PRINT TEMPLATE FOR HEALTH FACTORS REPORT

Category: 
  - Print Template

Description:
============

 This is a new print template for the HEALTH FACTORS file. It is an exact 
 copy of HEALTH FACTOR LIST except that it is formatted for 132 columns. 
 This gives the full value of each of the columns if needed.
  
 ER3(S):

 Associated NOIS:
 ----------------
 PUG-0104-50910 - Health Factor List truncated: 80- & 132-col displays
  
  
 NOIS Overview:
 -------------
  
 Problem:
  
 The PXTT LIST HEALTH FACTORS print template is set up to be able to print
 on an 80 column printer. This means that the fields have to be truncated.
 This becomes a problem for long field values where the first half of the
 value is the same as another. 
  
 Resolution:
  
 This new template is set up exactly the same except that the width
 allocated to each field is greater. This will then show the complete field
 value. It needs to be printed to a printer that can handle 132 columns.
 The new print template will be placed in a menu option called HEALTH
 FACTOR LIST 132 with a synonym of HFX under the existing menu option PCE
 INFORMATION ONLY.
