Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   This patch automates updates to the POSTAL CODE(#5.12) file.  Sites will
 automatically receive the latest POSTAL CODE(#5.12) updates when National
 updates the FORUM Master POSTAL CODE(#5.12) file.
  
   The FORUM Master POSTAL CODE(#5.12) file will be checked every Thursday
 at 11pm, Eastern time, for changes and if there are changes, the changes 
 will be broadcasted to VistA sites that are registered in the Patch
 Tracking module as having installed this patch. Please note that until the
 compliance date for this patch plus 7 days has been met, the same data
 will be broadcasted to insure all VistA sites have been updated to the
 current FORUM Master POSTAL CODE(#5.12) file.  After the compliance date
 for this patch plus 7 days has been met, then only new changes to the
 FORUM Master POSTAL CODE(#5.12) file will be broadcasted to those VistA
 sites, via a VistA mail message, that are registered in the Patch Tracking
 module as having installed this patch.
