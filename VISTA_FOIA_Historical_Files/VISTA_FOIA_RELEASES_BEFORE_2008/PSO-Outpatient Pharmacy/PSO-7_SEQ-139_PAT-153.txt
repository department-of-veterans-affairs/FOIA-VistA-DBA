Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 1. A new code has been added to the INACTIVATION REASON CODE field (#3) 
 of the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). The code is PATIENT UNREACHABLE. 
 This code will now be selectable when manually inactivating a patient 
 from the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). It will also display, when
 appropriate, on the reports generated by the Report TPB Patients Letters
 Printed/NOT Printed [PSO TPB LETTERS PRINTED REPORT] option, and the TPB
 Patient Report [PSO TPB PATIENT REPORT] option.
  
 2. Every Sunday, Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) patient data is sent
 in an HL7 message to Austin. This patch exports a new mail group, PSO TPB
 HL7 EXTRACT. Members of this mail group will receive weekly mail messages
 concerning the HL7 extract of TPB patient information. These messages 
 will either display information that the message generation was 
 successful, or display information that the message generation was 
 unsuccessful, along with a reason why it was unsuccessful. Upon install,
 the installer will be prompted for the coordinator of the mail group. The
 Post-Install routine of this patch will automatically add the patch 
 installer as a member of the mail group.
   
 The Post-Install routine PSO153PS will also set the AUTOSTART field (#4.5)
 of the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) of the PSOTPBAAC HL Logical Link to
 "Enabled".
  
 A correction has been made to the HL7 message to distinguish between 
 a new record and an edited record.
  
 3. The weekly HL7 transmission to Austin is found to cause problems at a
 few sites due to some bad "AX" cross-references of the TPB ELIGIBILITY
 file (#52.91). This patch fixes this issue.
  
 4. There is a possibility of getting a null subscript error when using the
 View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option to view the provider details 
 after either of the following circumstances: 
  
 a. When a new provider was added using the Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER
    ADD] option, and "No" was the response to the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field
    (#53.91) of NEW PERSON file (#200).  
 b. When a Provider was edited using the Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]
    option, and "No" was the response to the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field
    (#53.91) of NEW PERSON file (#200), and then an "^" was entered prior
    to responding to the prompts for these fields of the NEW PERSON file
    (#200): 
    TAX ID field (#53.92)
    EXCLUSIONARY CHECK PERFORMED field (#53.93) 
    DATE EXCLUSIONARY LIST CHECKED field (#53.94) 
    ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST field  (#53.95)
    EXCLUSIONARY CHECKED BY field (#53.96)
  
 This patch corrects the error.
  
 5. When selecting a provider using the TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO
 TPB RX ENTRY] option, if the provider is unauthorized to write med orders
 or flagged as inactive, there are currently no alerts or warnings
 indicating that the provider cannot be selected. This patch will provide 
 one of the following messages during provider selection if such conditions
 are encountered:
  
 a. This Provider is not Authorized to Write Med Orders. Use the Edit 
    Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change the Authorization flag.
  
 b. This Provider is flagged as Inactive. Use the Edit Provider
    [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change the Inactive Date.
  
 c. This Provider is not Authorized to Write Med Orders and flagged as 
    Inactive. Use the Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change
    them.
  
 6. The FAX NUMBER field (#.136) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) has been 
 added to the following options, for display and for editing:
 Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD] option
 Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option
 View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option
  
 This enhancement is requested by E3R 18457.
                                                              
 7. This patch provides an API to the Scheduling V. 5.3 package that
 returns a list of all patients eligible for the TPB, to be used for
 reporting purposes.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
 This patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy
 users on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not
 being acted upon through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). This 
 patch also should not be installed when the daily PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT
 option is queued to run. That option was originally sent out with queuing
 to occur at 18:00 (6:00pm). Installation of this patch should take no
 longer than 5 minutes.
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*153)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*153.
  
 6. When Prompted "Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'PSO TPB HL7 
    EXTRACT':" respond with the person's name that will be the coordinator
    of this new mail group. If no coordinator is entered during patch 
    install, a coordinator can be added later.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
