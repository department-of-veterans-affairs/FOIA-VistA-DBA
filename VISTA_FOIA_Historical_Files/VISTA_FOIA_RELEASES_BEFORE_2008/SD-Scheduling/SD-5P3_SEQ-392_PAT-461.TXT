Subject: EXTRACTING DATA - ACRP AD HOC Report

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem with the Ambulatory Care Ad Hoc Report.  If a
 user runs the report for a single range of diagnosis codes, the report
 runs correctly.  However, if a user runs the report and  selects two or
 more different ranges of diagnosis codes, no data is found, even if data
 is found when each range is run separately.  This problem exists in both
 the Detailed and the Summary versions of the report.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD101847 - Extracting data - ACRP AD HOC Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user runs the Ambulatory Care Ad Hoc Report for a single range
     of diagnosis codes, the report runs correctly.  However, if a user
     runs the report and selects two or more different ranges of diagnosis
     codes, no data is found, even if data is found when each range is run
     separately.  This is true for both the Detailed and the Summary
     reports.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The existing logic in routine SCRPW26 will be modified so that the
     reports will extract all pertinent data for multiple selected ranges
     of diagnosis codes.  The Perspective evaluation logic and the
     Limitations evaluation logic were both modified so that the reports
     can be run for Perspective Outpatient Encounter/Division or for
     Perspective Diagnosis/All Diagnosis.
