Subject: HUI API/CONCURRENT CASE CANCELING/CASE SCHEDULING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Surgery is using the Flag Drugs for Use as Anesthesia Agents [SROCODE]
    option to flag drugs in the DRUG file (#50) for use as anesthesia
    agents. This patch modifies this option to call Pharmacy Data
    Management V. 1.0 (PDM) package so that PDM possibly generates an HL7
    outgoing drug message.
  
 2. When canceling a concurrent case using the Cancel Scheduled Operation
    [SRSCAN] option, the software prompts, "There is a concurrent case
    associated with this operation. Do you want to cancel it also? YES//".
    If the user quits using the up-arrow ("^"), the software does not
    respond correctly and subsequently errors out. This patch fixes this
    problem.
  
 3. It was reported that if the Surgery case was in a requested state
    and if an entry is made in the TIME PAT IN OR field (#.205) of the
    SURGERY file (#130), it is found that the time gets appended to the
    DATE OF OPERATION field (#.09) of the SURGERY file (#130). This is
    causing the time to appear in the scheduling grid and prevents the case
    scheduling. This entry should be made only if the case is in a
    scheduled state or entered via the Operation Menu [SROPER] option.
    This patch provides the user the option to delete any of the following
    entered date fields in the SURGERY file (#130) as a pre-condition for
    scheduling such cases:
  
     - ANES CARE START TIME field (#.21)
     - TIME OPERATION BEGAN field (#.22)
     - TIME OPERATION ENDS field (#.23)
     - ANES CARE END TIME field (#.24)
     - TIME PAT IN OR field (#.205)
     - TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232)
  
    This functionality is added to the following options:
     - Delete or Update Operation Requests [SRSUPRQ] option
     - Schedule Requested Operations [SRSCHD1] option
     - Reschedule or Update a Scheduled Operation [SRSCHUP] option

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation takes
 less than two minutes. This patch can be installed at any time.
 Installation of this patch should NOT be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*114):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*114.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.

  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
