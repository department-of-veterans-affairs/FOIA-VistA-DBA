Subject: CPRS Response Time Monitor

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

                    CPRS Response Time Monitor
  
 Associated Patches:
 ===================
      OR*3*209   <<= Must be installed BEFORE XT*7.3*84 
      TIU*1*122  <<= Must be installed BEFORE XT*7.3*84
  
 Description:
 ============
  
      The software, when "turned on", records the response times for Lab,
 TIU and Clinical reminders information retrieval on the server side.  It
 is averaged and posted every ten minutes to a web page in a graphical
 format.  This build brings in 3 seperate patches: XT*7.3*84, TIU*1*181, 
 and OR*3*214.  All three patches are contained in a single host file 
 CPRS_RESPONSE_TIME_MONITOR.KID which can be retrieved from one of the 
 VA's FTP sites, such as, ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov.
  
      Sites are strongly urged to first download the manual set for the 
 CPRS Monitor.  They are:  
  
            CPRS_RESPONSE_TIME_INSTALLATION GUIDE.PDF
            CPRS_RESPONSE_TIME_MONITOR_USER_GUIDE.PDF
            CPRS_RESPONSE_TIME_TECHNICAL_MANUAL.PDF
  
 Important Notice to sites:
 ==========================
  
      It is very important that the installing site pay particular
 attention the post-init requirements, specifically the set up of the
 parameter file and the options which must be queued on Taskman at specific
 times.  All items should be followed step by step and then rechecked for
 accuracy.  The most important options are, in order:
  
         AWCM LOCAL ROLLUP           Local Nightly Rollup
         AWCM ROLL UP NATIONAL DATA  Roll Up Data to National Database
  
      The local rollup of data moves response time data from a temporary
 file ^XTMP("AWCCPRS to a permanent file ^AWC(177100.13. It must occur
 before the national rollup runs or the data will be unavailable for
 national reporting.  The national reporting is of utmost importance
 because of the 01/31/2004 deadline for all sites.  After the first 
 scheduled national roll up completes, site data should be displayed at 
 the web site: 
  
      <http://vaww1.va.gov/ITMonitors/IT_Monitors_response.cfm>
  
  
      These options are important but are secondary to the above options:
  
         AWCM CPRS MONITOR              Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data
         AWCM PURGE CPRS MONITOR DATA   Purge CPRS Monitor Data
  
      The local issue of the web page generation may take 1-2 days to set
 up. You will need the Installation Guide and the cooperation and aid 
 of your webmaster unless you are very familiar with the web pages in your 
 VISN. The purging will not be an issue for several days and if not set up,
 will catch up the first time it is run.
