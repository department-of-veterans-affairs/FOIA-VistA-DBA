 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take less 
 than 2 minutes. Installation should be coordinated with the person who manages
 Clinical Reminders at your site and be scheduled during a time of lower system 
 usage. 
  
 Using the Kernel KIDs menu
  
 1. Use the 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS installation menu.
    When prompted to enter a host file type in PXRM_2_0_8.KID
  
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (PXRM*2.0*8)
         
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?"
    YES//  respond 'NO'
  
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
    "respond 'NO'.
  
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'No'. 
  
 7. When prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//," respond '0'.
    This installation should not be queued; it will be installing
    some packed reminder definitions and may require selection of
    replacements for some components. Therefore it is recommended
    that the site's Clinical Reminder Manager is present during the
    install.
  
 8. The init routine PXRMP8I may be deleted once the installation has 
    completed. Sites should use the Kernel "Delete Routines" option
    [XTRDEL] to delete this routine.
  
 
 Post-Install instructions
 =========================
 The following dialog elements are meant to be used for ordering a consult to 
 the team at your facility that does further evaluation of patients with 
 possible TBI. 
  
 VA-TBI OI CONSULT FOR KNOWN TBI
 VA-PDIQ POLYTRAUMA CONSULT
  
 At the time of install, the Reminder Dialog will use the GMRCOR CONSULT as the 
 consult order dialog for both of the dialog elements. Sites should substitute a 
 quick order or order menu for ordering consults to the TBI team at your 
 facility. If no such service is available yet, then sites may wish to leave the 
 GMRCOR CONSULT in the element until a consult becomes available.
  
 The mapping of the Quick Order should be done by the site Clinical Reminder
 Manager.
  
 To map a site-specific quick order to the above dialog elements, do the 
 following from the Reminder Managers menu.
  
   1.  Select DM Reminder Dialog Management
   2.  Select DI Reminder Dialogs
   3.  Type CV, then press Enter
   4.  Type E, then press Enter
   5.  Type SL, then press Enter
   6.  Type the name of the dialog element, VA-TBI OI CONSULT FOR KNOWN TBI and 
       press Enter
   7.  At the "Find Next" prompt type No, then press Enter
   8.  Type the item number next to the element, then press Enter
   9.  At the finding Item Prompt, enter Q. plus the name of the site-specific
       Quick Order or order menu, then press Enter
   10. Press Enter at the Additional Finding prompt
   11. Press Enter at the Edit prompt
   11. Repeat the above steps for the other dialog element, 
       VA-PDIQ POLYTRAUMA CONSULT
