Subject: REPORT HEADER CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1.  Problem: NOIS MAD-0104-40858 
     The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) reports,
     with the exception of the Cumulative/Vitals Measurement Report, does 
     not display allergy information in the reports header.
  
     Corrective Action: The BCMA Reports, with the exception of the 
     Cumulative/Vitals Measurement Report, displays allergy information in
     the reports header. The Reactions header has also been removed
     from the report and replaced with the "ADRs:" header.
  
 2.  Problem: NOIS BUT-0204-20463
     The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option and the Due 
     List [PSBO DL] option add an exclamation point (i.e., Spec Inst:
     !Please verify) to the prefix of a Special Instruction.                   
  
     Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
     option and the Due List [PSBO DL] option correctly removes the          
     exclamation point (i.e., Spec Inst: Please verify) added to a Special   
     Instruction.                                                            
    
 3.  Problem: NOIS BED-0204-10327
     When a clinician administers a Pro Rea Nata (PRN) medication using 
     the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, and the
     administration date/time is set to an earlier timeframe, the PRN
     administration date/time displays incorrectly on BCMA PRN
     Effectiveness Log Report as the entered date/time of this 
     administration occurred.
  
     Corrective Action: When a clinician administers a PRN medication 
     using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, and
     the administration date/time is set to an earlier timeframe, the PRN
     administration date/time displays correctly on the BCMA PRN             
     Effectiveness Log Report as the actual date/time of the                 
     administration.
  
 4.  Problem: NOIS NTH-0304-72663
     A "Null subscript" error occurs at routine line "EN+4^PSBVDLPA"
     when there is single patient with data entered in the BCMA Medication 
     Log File (#53.79) and indexes.  This error occurs during the 
     initial implementation of the BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
     system.
     
     Corrective Action: The initial implementation of the BCMA GUI will 
     not generate a "Null subscript" error at routine line "EN+4^PSBVDLPA".

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites can retrieve VISTA documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
      available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
 
  
 OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
