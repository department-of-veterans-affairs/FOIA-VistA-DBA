 INTRODUCTION
 ============
  
 The software for this patch, IB*2*135, and associated patch
 PRCA*4.5*173, are not being distributed through the National
 Patch Module.  These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS
 software distribution (host file).  This patch contains the informational
 portion of IB*2*135 only.  Refer to the patch documentation for patch
 PRCA*4.5*173 for the instructions on how to acquire, install, and 
 implement the patch software.
   
 Patch IB*2*135 contains the Integrated Billing software changes that 
 support the Third Party EDI Lockbox initiative where third party payers
 will be sending electronic funds transfers (EFT) to the V.A.'s Lockbox
 bank in place of paper checks currently sent to the sites.  They will also
 be sending Explanation of Benefit (EOB) statements electronically as
 Electronic Remittance Advices (ERA) in place of the paper EOBs they
 currently send to AR at the sites.  These electronic EOBs will be stored
 in the Integrated Billing EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS file #361.1 and are
 available to be viewed in TPJI under the Bill Charges action.
  
 An additional piece of functionality indirectly affecting the Integrated
 Billing software is the addition of a call to A/R to auto-audit a bill.  
 This can occur if the IB system receives and files an electronic bill
 status message, the bill is currently not audited in AR, the rate type of
 the bill has been set up to allow auto-audit (an AR function) and the
 relay status code of the return message is one of a pre-determined set
 that indicates the bill has either been sent to the clearinghouse's print
 shop or sent electronically to the payer.

                        SERVICE DATE FROM (#.16) - modified name

                                 Subfile: REASONS (#1)
                                        AMOUNT (#.02) - added negative 
                                                        numbers

                                 PAID MODIFIERS (#.01) - changed to free 
                                                         text
               Subfile: 835 CLAIM LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS (#361.11)
                        Subfile: REASONS (#1)
                                 AMOUNT (#.02) - added negative numbers
  
 3.  MODIFIED FILE ENTRIES:
  
    There are 2 entries in file 364.7 that have been included to correct
    a problem where electronic institutional (UB92) bills could not output
    more than 1 modifier for a procedure.
  
    These are internal entries #181 and #182 and will be automatically
    updated on your system.
  
 4.  PRE-INSTALLATION:
    
    The patch contains a pre-installation routine IBY135PR that deletes the
    data dictionary entry for the PROCEDURE field (#.04) in the EXPLANATION
    OF BENEFITS FILE (#361.1), field 835 LINE LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS (field #15,
    subfield #361.115). This is necesssary because the build contains this
    field and changes its type from pointer to free text.  The kids build
    does not fully clean up the DD entry when this type of change is made,
    so the field must first be deleted in the pre-install and then re-added
    in the main part of the installation to prevent DD corruption.
  
 5.  ROUTINE SUMMARY:
  
    This patch consists of a total of 16 routines, including
    7 new routines and 9 existing routines that have been modified.
