Subject: C&P WORKSHEET MODULE PHASE I

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch provides VistA updates necessary to support new C&P template
 functionality to be released in the next CAPRI GUI (DVBA*2.7*66).  The
 enhancements implemented by this patch will not affect current AMIE
 functionality, nor will it hinder usage of the currently released CAPRI
 GUI (DVBA*2.7*45D).
  
 The goal of the CAPRI Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) 
 project is to implement the current AMIE C&P exam worksheets in an
 electronic format that will upload exam results into TIU and make the
 results visible to CPRS users.  CPWM will be a component of the currently
 deployed CAPRI GUI application.  Modifications to the CAPRI patient
 display will allow users to launch CPWM and gain access to the new
 templates via a new C&P Worksheets tab.  A new security key (DVBA CAPRI 
 WORKSHEET TAB) has been added to VistA so that the C&P Worksheets tab will
 be visible only to those who need to use its functionality.
  
 Phase I of this project, DVBA*2.7*53, encompasses the release of the CPWM
 application along with the following C&P exam templates: Aid & Attendance,
 Audio, Genitourinary, and Skin Diseases (Other than Scars).  The remaining
 exam templates will be released periodically over FY'04 during Phase II of
 the project.  **Please note that these templates will only be accessible
 through the CAPRI GUI.  The AMIE worksheets will not be affected by this
 project.
  
 There are some secondary purposes for this patch as well.  The patch will
 prevent CAPRI users from running older, unsupported versions of CAPRI to
 ensure that all users nationally are on the same version, DVBA*2.7*45 or
 later.  There is also a bug fix concerning environmental differences when
 reports are run in the GUI vs roll-n-scroll. 
  
 The following NOIS's are addressed in this patch:
  
  NOIS VAC-0903-20636, reports issues in which a comment in the appt. list 
  gets replicated to subsequent entries in the appt. list display.  
  
  NOIS FAR-0903-40080, reports an issue in which there is an error 
  due to an undefined variable if a DVBA ALL ADMISSIONS report is queued
  from VistA.  
  
  NOIS AMA-0104-71472 and duplicated TUC-0204-60298, report runaway routine 
  consuming CPU processing resources. This occurs when there are no members 
  in the mail group DVBA C NEW C&P VETERAN.
  
  
 CPWM TIU TITLES
 ===============
 Because the new template functionality stores documents in TIU, it's 
 necessary that your Clinical Application Coordinator or TIU support staff
 verify the existence of appropriate note titles for C&P documents.  CAPRI
 will search for titles containing "C&P" or "COMPENSATION AND PENSION" or 
 "COMP AND PEN" or "COMP & PEN" or "COMPENSATION & PENSION".  If those 
 strings are contained in a title, CAPRI will screen out all other titles
 and only allow the matching titles to be selected.  If no matches are
 found on these strings, all titles will be allowed for selection.  
  
 It is recommended that there be at least a standard "C&P EXAM" title.  If
 the site would like to create more specific titles (i.e. "C&P AUDIO"),
 that would also be a reasonable step to take.  Granularity of titles is a
 local site decision.
  
  
 CPWM USER SETUP
 ===============
 To activate CPWM for a particular user, a menu option and several keys
 must be assigned:
  
  1. DVBA CAPRI GUI - This is the option context to the main CAPRI 
     application.  All CAPRI users will need this menu option assigned.
  
  2. DVBA CAPRI WORKSHEET TAB - This key makes the C&P Worksheets tab
     visible inside CAPRI.  All VHA CAPRI users should get this key.
  
  3. Only ONE of the following keys must be assigned for anyone who will be
     creating new C&P exam templates with CPWM.
  
     a. DVBAB CPWM DISALLOW REVIEW - User doesn't need their documents 
        reviewed prior to release.
     b. DVBAB CPWM OPTIONAL REVIEW - User can choose to send some documents
        for review and not other documents.
     c. DVBAB CPWM REQUIRE REVIEW -  User must have all documents reviewed
        by a reviewer prior to upload.
  
  4. DVBAB CPWM REVIEWER - If either the OPTIONAL REVIEW or REQUIRE REVIEW
     key is assigned to any user, at least one or more users will need to
     be designated as an official reviewer and be assigned the DVBAB CPWM
     REVIEWER key.
  
  IRM will need to coordinate with the C&P clinic to determine what keys a 
  user should receive.  The majority of users will need 2 new keys.  The 
  reviewer type user will need 3 keys.
  
  
 CPWM COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING
 ============================
 A multimedia application demonstrating the core functions in CPWM can be 
 downloaded from OI FTP servers, as indicated below.  It's also available
 for download off of the Compensation and Pension Examination Project
 (CPEP) website at this URL:
 "http://vaww.cpep.med.va.gov/SHARE/ReferenceGuides/CAPRI_CPWM_Training_Set
 up.exe"  (Please append this line to the line above when typing it in your
 web browser, so that the URL ends with the word "Setup.exe".)
  
 If you have any trouble with the direct URL, please go to the index at 
 http://vaww.cpep.med.va.gov/SHARE/ReferenceGuides/Forms/Ref_GuidesV2.htm 
 and find the link for the CPWM training package.  
  
 The file size of the trainer is 105 megs.  Please be aware that it may be
 best to download the file early in the day or late in the afternoon due to
 traffic on the network during the day.  Installation requires
 administration privileges on the workstation.  IRM should install the
 trainer for any provider who will be using CPWM.  After installation, the
 trainer's shortcut will appear on the user's desktop.
