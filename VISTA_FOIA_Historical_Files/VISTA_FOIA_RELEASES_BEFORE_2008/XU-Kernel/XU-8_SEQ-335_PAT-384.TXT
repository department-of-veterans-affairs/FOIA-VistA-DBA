                         XU*8.0*384
  
 This patch facilitates the notification of an employee's termination from 
 NEW PERSON (File #200) and separation from PAID EMPLOYEE (File #450) to 
 individuals at the local facility with a need to know.
  
 A new bulletin, XUSERDEAC, has been created to send the XUSER 
 DEACTIVATION message to a facility-specific mail group (example:  g.IRM) 
 when a user is terminated in the NEW PERSON file (TERMINATION DATE (#9.2) 
 is entered less than or equal to TODAY and account is 
 deactivated).  This bulletin simply advises the recipients of the XUSER 
 DEACTIVATION message that IRM has terminated the NEW PERSON account for 
 the user listed.  Use of this bulletin is optional since primary 
 notification of a user's separation or termination from employment must 
 come from PAID.  Sites who do not wish to set up this feature should skip 
 Step 5.a. of the Installation Instructions section.
  
 A new routine, XUSECBUL, that supports a new cross reference, AXUSEC, of 
 the PAID EMPLOYEE file is also included.  The creation of the AXUSEC 
 cross reference will be released in a future PAID patch.  Once this new 
 cross reference is created, a bulletin will send a separation 
 notice to a new mail group, XUSEC/PRS PAID SEPARATION, when PAID EMPLOYEE
 field SEPARATION IND (#80) is entered as Y.  This notification will serve 
 as the primary notice of an employee's separation/termination (all 
 computer access for the employee should be terminated at this time).
  
 This patch also updates the AUSER cross reference of the field DISUSER 
 (#7) in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.  A re-index of the AUSER cross 
 reference will take place as a part of the patch install (the AUSER cross 
 reference will be deleted for users whose LAST SIGN-ON 
 DATE/TIME (#202) is greater than 540 days.
