Description:
============

  
 This patch contains modifications to the Consolidated Mail Outpatient 
 Pharmacy (CMOP) system.
  
 Problem 1:
 CMOP is erroneously sending a mail message stating that Patients whose
 mailing status is changed to Do Not Mail, are having their Rx's still
 suspended for CMOP trasmission. These Rx's are actually suspending locally
 and are printing with the regular suspense print.
  
 Solution:
 Discontinue sending mail message when this condition occurs.
  
 Problem 2:
 Mail Message on a "test patient" shows a problem with the Patient Address.
  
 An error has been encountered while processing prescription data for the
 Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy system.

      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option:

          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
