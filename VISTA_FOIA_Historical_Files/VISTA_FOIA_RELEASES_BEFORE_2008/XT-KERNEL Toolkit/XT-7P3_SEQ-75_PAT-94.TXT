 This patch sends out the new CheckSum Utility CHECK1^XTSUMBLD, and the 
 new logic CheckSum: %^ZOSF("RSUM1").
  
 The new CheckSum, CHECK1^XTSUMBLD, is more accurate than the old 
 CheckSum utility.  The new logic CheckSum will support option [XU 
 CHECKSUM REPORT] slated to be released with Kernel Patch XU*8.0*369.
  
 The new CheckSum Utility fixes the problem of the old CheckSum giving
 the same CheckSum value even if some lines have been swapped around for a 
 routine.

 >>D CHECK1^XTSUMBLD
  
 New CheckSum CHECK1^XTSUMBLD:
  
 This option determines the current checksum of selected routine(s).
 The Checksum of the routine is determined as follows:
  
 1. Any comment line with a single semi-colon is presumed to be
    followed by comments and only the line tag will be included.
  
 2. Line 2 will be excluded from the count.
  
 3. The total value of the routine is determined (excluding
    exceptions noted above) by multiplying the ASCII value of each
    character by its position on the line and position of the line in 
    the routine being checked.
  
      Select one of the following:
