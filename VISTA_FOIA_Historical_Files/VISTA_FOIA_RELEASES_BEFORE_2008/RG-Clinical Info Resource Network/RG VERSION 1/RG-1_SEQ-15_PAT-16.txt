Subject: MPI/PD STATUS DISPLAY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  This patch introduces the MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY]
  option, which is placed on the CIRN Patient Admin Coordinator Menu
  [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].  This functionality was requested by Clinical
  Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and Master
  Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) contacts participating in a September 12 -
  14, 2000 meeting in Augusta, GA.
   
  The MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY] option calculates
  and presents the following data.
  - the number of unresolved exceptions in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG 
    (#991.1) file for the CIRN PD/MPI related entries (e.g., internal 
    entry numbers 209, 213-218) in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION TYPE (#991.11)
    file,
  - the number of unresolved exceptions in the PATIENT DATA EXCEPTION
    (#391.98) file with an EXCEPTION STATUS (#391.984) file value of
    ACTION REQUIRED, DATA EXAMINED or BEING REVIEWED,
  - the number of entries in the MPIF CMOR REQUEST (#984.9) file with
    a STATUS (#.06) field value of OPEN, REQUESTED, PENDING APPROVAL,
    APPROVED or DISAPPROVED,
  - the condition of the UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3 [VAFC BATCH UPDATE]
    and Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
    background jobs in the OPTION SCHEDULING (#19.2) file,
  - the state of the CIRN Event Queue processor,
  - the condition of the STOP CIRN MESSAGING (#16) field in the CIRN
    SITE PARAMETER file (#991.8), and
  - the AUDIT status of the NAME (#.01) field in the PATIENT (#2) file.
   
  The Exception Handler and Patient Data Review numbers indicate how
  up-to-date a facility is in exception resolution.  The CMOR request
  numbers specify how many requests for change of CMOR have been sent
  and their resulting status.  This data can be useful in reducing the
  number of exceptions.
   
  The VAFC BATCH UPDATE background job should always be running unless
  it has been unscheduled for patch installation or similar purposes.
  If it is not scheduled, use the TaskMan option Schedule/Unschedule
  Options [XUTM SCHEDULE], and schedule it to run every ten minutes.
   
  The MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES background job should be scheduled to run
  weekly, at some time during the night.
   
  The CIRN Event Queue processor should always be set to RUNNING.  If
  the state is NOT RUNNING, use the Start CIRN Event Queue [RGEQ START]
  option to re-start it.
   
  The STOP CIRN MESSAGING (#16) field in the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8)
  file should always be set to SEND MESSAGES.
   
  AUDIT on the NAME (#.01) field in the PATIENT (#2) file should be set
  to YES, ALWAYS.  If necessary, this can be re-set using VA FileMan,
  OTHER OPTIONS, AUDITING, TURN DATA AUDIT ON/OFF.
   
  New Option:
  ===========
  The MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY] option is placed
  on the CIRN Patient Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].
