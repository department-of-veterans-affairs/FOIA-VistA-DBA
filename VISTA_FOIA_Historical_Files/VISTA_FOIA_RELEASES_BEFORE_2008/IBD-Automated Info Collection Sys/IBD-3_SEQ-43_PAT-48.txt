Description: 
============

 This patch is a means to distribute National Mental Health and Primary 
 Care Encounter Forms to the field in accordance to "Veterans Health
 Administration Revenue Cycle Improvement Plan", Final Report, September
 2001.
  
 "Secretary Principi directed the Under Secretary for Health, through the 
 VHA Chief Financial Officer, to develop a revenue cycle improvement plan. 
 To accomplish this charge, the VHA Chief Financial Officer assembled two 
 groups of experts in the form of two distinct committees:  (i) VHA 
 Revenue Cycle Steering Committee -- comprised of a diverse group of VA 
 senior management -- provided vision and strategic oversight of the plan; 
 (ii) VHA Revenue Cycle Work Group, comprised of Central Office and field 
 staff, which developed the detailed recommendations of the plan."
  
 "This vision of the Revenue Program is based on two solid principles: the 
 principles of standardization and accountability.  The standardization of 
 policy, technology, data capture, measurement, and training and education 
 should enhance VHA's ability to effectively manage its revenue cycle."
  
 Within this report, the following was tasked.
  
 "Develop and mandate use of electronic encounter form & documentation 
 template"
  
 Rationale
 ---------
 VHA provider documentation, in many instances, lacks the required 
 elements that result in either a non-billable service or a lower valued 
 service.  Each VISN, and in many cases, each line of service, may use 
 different encounter forms and documentation templates for encounter data 
 capture. 
  
 Description 
 -----------
 This plan proposes collaboration among Revenue Office and OI staff to 
 develop standardized, electronic encounter forms for use in the CPRS 
 system that can be used throughout the VHA by clinicians.  The use of the 
 electronic claim form will eliminate the need for manual data entry into 
 PCE or Appointment Manager. The use of documentation templates will 
 prompt providers to document the elements of the patient encounter that 
 are required by VHA's documentation policy.  It will ensure the 
 standardization of code sets for specialty areas in the near-term and all 
 areas eventually: it reduces or eliminates the data validation required 
 by coders to ensure proper code assignment. 
  
 This project requires VHA to develop and implement nationally 
 standardized encounter forms (by specialty) and documentation templates 
 for use in all VHA medical centers.  Providers at several medical 
 centers have developed documentation templates that prompt providers to 
 document essential elements of the patient encounter (e.g. chief 
 complaint, review of systems, physical examination elements etc.). In 
 many instances, these elements are performed but not documented: the lack 
 of this documentation results in either a non-billable service or a lower 
 valued service.  This patch is to correct the problem.
  
 Outcome(s)
 ----------
 Electronic templates for encounter forms and documentation will benefit 
 VHA through improved quality of data capture.  In addition, the 
 implementation of national templates will eliminate the manpower required 
 to create templates at each facility while also ensuring standardization 
 through one comprehensive template.
  
 A new performance measure for percentage of encounter with electronic 
 notes will monitor compliance with this improvement plan.
