 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 HD0000000117319:        VMP FY06 MidYr SC Request
  
  1. Problem:
  -----------
  The regular yearly Stop Code patch for FY06 was missing some Restriction 
  Dates (for new Stop Codes with Restriction Types of P or S).  This is a 
  request to remedy that problem. It is not urgent but is needed to conform 
  to the rules and make the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file have what is expected.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The changes were submitted by the DSS Support Office to be implemented
  upon release of the patch. This patch updates the CLINIC STOP (#40.7)
  file:
       Adds seven (7) restriction dates.
                                                     RESTRICTION
      ID            Name                             TYPE   DATE
      --            ----                             ----   ----

  2. Problem:
  -----------
  The Stop Code Task Force (Council) would like to make the INACTIVE
  DATE (#2) field in CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file uneditable (and so
  undeletable) for Fileman users.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The Data Dictionary was changed to modify the INACTIVE DATE (#2) field
  in CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file uneditable (and so undeletable) for Fileman
  users.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
  that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
      2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
         be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
      3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
      4. From this menu, you may select the following options:
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*465)
         a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
            DDs, templates, etc.).
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
            the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
         d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
      5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
         SD*5.3*465.
  
      6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//" respond NO.
  
      7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
      8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
         returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
         completion.
  
      9. You may delete the routine SD7USTOP from your production system
         after the patch has been successfully installed and verified.
  
   NOTE: Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided
         during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install
         File Print option on the Utilities menu on the Kernel Installation
         and Distribution System menu.
