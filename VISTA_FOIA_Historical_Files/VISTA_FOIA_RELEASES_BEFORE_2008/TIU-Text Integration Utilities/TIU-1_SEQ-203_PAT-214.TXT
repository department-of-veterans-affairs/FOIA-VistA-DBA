Subject: REPORT OF MIS-MATCHED ID NOTES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains a routine that will Report/Fix Mis-matched ID notes.
 There are cases where a child ID note points to a parent ID and that
 parent ID note is for a different patient or do not exist. There are also 
 cases where the "GDAD" cross reference links a child ID note to a parent 
 ID note when in fact the child does not point to the parent. The report 
 will also show child id notes that point to a note that may not be a
 parent ID.
  
 The cause of these situations is being addressed in patch TIU*1.0*217.
  
 The new routine will be found as option TIU MISMATCHED ID NOTES under
 the option TIU MAIN MENU MGR.
  
 When this report is run in either Report Only or in Report and Fix mode,
 an email will be sent to the PSI-06-030 mail group on Forum every time the
 option is accessed. This email message will print the Site, Date/Time,
 Report mode and results. No patient data of any kind is sent.
 The main purpose of the mail message is to track the extent of this 
 problem. The child notes that point to a parent that is not a parent ID 
 will not be included in these emails.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 Problem: There are rare cases where a child ID note can point to a 
 parent ID note for a different patient. There are also cases where the 
 "GDAD" cross reference says a child ID note points to a parent ID note  
 when in fact it does not. 
  
 Solution: The root cause of the problem is being addressed in patch 
 TIU*1.0*217. In the interim this patch contains a routine that will report
 on and clean up ID notes in the above cases. The link will be broken, the
 bad cross references deleted and a report will be generated. 
 A list of child notes that point to a parent that may not be a parent ID 
 note will also be generated, but it is informational for investigation 
 and nothing will be done automatically.
