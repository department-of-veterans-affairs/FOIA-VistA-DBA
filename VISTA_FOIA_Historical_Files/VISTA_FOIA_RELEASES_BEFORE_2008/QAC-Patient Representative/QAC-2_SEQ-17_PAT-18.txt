 Description:

 A problem was discovered with the Service/Discipline Issue Totals [QAC 
 SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT] report - it would not report results when just one 
 Division was selected.  The same code is used for the Discipline Issue 
 Totals [QAC DISC ISSUE TOT] report, and the fix made with this patch 
 addresses both reports.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system, however, it should be
 installed during a non-peak period of usage. It is advisable to queue the
 install at a date and time when there is low database access. In order to
 queue the installation enter 'Q' when prompted for the device name. If you
 choose not to use a printer device to send the installation to, it is
 acceptable to use a null device. Next enter the device name, then the time
 the install is to start.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only].
  
   2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
      the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
      menu, select the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter  QAC*2.0*18)
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
          NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
          patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
          the components of the KIDS build.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      QAC*2.0*18.
  
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//', respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
          Discipline Issue Totals           [QAC DISC ISSUE TOT]
          Service/Discipline Issue Totals   [QAC SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT]
  
   8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completed.
