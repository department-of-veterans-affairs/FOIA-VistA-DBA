Subject: DRUG LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When performing drug lookups, two issues were identified. First, the user 
 was not aware of which item was being matched. For example, was the match
 for the GENERIC NAME of the drug or was it the SYNONYM. The second issue 
 had to do with the search matching to the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS NAME first, 
 before checking for a GENERIC NAME. This patch makes two changes to the
 drug lookup. First, the search will display the item being searched on.
 Second, if one or more matches are found on an item, but the user
 doesn't select one of the matches displayed, the search will continue
 through all other items. A sample screen display follows:
  
  Select DRUG: hep
        Lookup: VA DRUG CLASS  CLASSIFICATION
  HEPARIN ANTAGONISTS  BL200
     HEPARIN ANTAGONISTS
      Lookup: DRUG  NATIONAL DRUG CLASS

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Do not install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are using the
 software. Installation will take no longer than 2 minutes. There are no
 scheduling restrictions or recommendations.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*112) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*112.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO. 
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
