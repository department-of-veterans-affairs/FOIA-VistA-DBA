Description: 
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch OR*3*132 provides new functionality s well as numerous other 
 improvements and fixes in many areas.  These are outlined below, 
 with associated E3Rs and NOIS where applicable.
  
 -- SURGERY
  
 - The Surgery tab has been added to the list of selectable initial 
 tabs under user preferences, but only if the Surgery tab is present.
  
 - The package-level value for parameter ORWOR SHOW SURGERY TAB is 
 now exported as YES, provided that Surgery patch SR*3.0*100 is 
 detected.
  
 -- COVER SHEET
   
 - For patients admitted to a domiciliary, both inpatient and 
 outpatient meds will now be shown on the cover sheet, and 
 appropriately identified as such.
  
 - When clicking on a canceled appointment which had notes attached, 
 the text of those notes failed to display.  This has been corrected.
  
 -- CLINICAL PROCEDURES
  
 -- The new CPRS/Clinical Procedure functionality will not become active 
 until after Clinical Procedure package is install.
  
 -- NOTES, CONSULTS, DISCHARGE SUMMARY
  
 - If a Discharge Summary is saved as UNRELEASED or UNVERIFIED, it 
 will no longer appear on the Review/Sign Changes list for the 
 current session, and the user will not be prompted for a signature 
 that can't yet be applied.
  
 - Upon saving the discharge summary being edited, the status will 
 now be correctly saved per the following, based on whether release 
 and/or verification are required, and the on the user's reply to the 
 prompt that appears:
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   |                   |         MAS VERIFICATION REQUIRED     |
   |  REQUIRE RELEASE  |             YES             NO        |
   |-----------------------------------------------------------|
   |      YES          | User YES:  UNVERIFIED    UNSIGNED     |
   |                   | User NO :  UNRELEASED    UNRELEASED   | 
   |-----------------------------------------------------------|
   |       NO          |            UNVERIFIED    UNSIGNED     |
   ============================================================= 
  
 - "Custom View" and "Custom List" were used interchangeably as menu 
 options, on the "View" and popup menus.  All of these now read 
 "Custom View" for consistency. 
  
 - Resizing of TIU edit windows below 74 characters has now been 
 prevented, to avoid some reported reformatting problems.
  
 - There was a bug in both TIU and CPRS that allowed a TIU document 
 to be stored without a pointer to a valid visit.  Patch TIU*1.0*124 
 (currently in test, and not required) will provide most of the fix 
 for this issue, but there were also some GUI changes required.  
 Those are included here.
  
 - A template bug was described in NOIS PUG-0701-51841, where if the 
 user copies a child template into several sections of the same parent, 
 it was not usable when the user opened and attempted to fill out the 
 template.
  
 -- LAB ORDERING
  
 - If a relative immediate collect time was stored in a quick order 
 and at the time of placing the order the resolved value of that 
 date/time fell outside of the allowable immediate collect schedule 
 for that date, the order could still be placed with the invalid time.  
 The user will now be presented with the lab ordering dialog and must 
 enter a new immediate collect time before the order will be accepted.
  
 -- CONSULTS
  
 - NOIS HEH-0102-40939, ASH-0102-32387, BIL-0102-33082:  The problem 
 where canceling from Prerequisites display screen did not terminate 
 the ordering process was fixed.
  
 - NOIS V02-0202-N0527:  A problem where existing quick order with 
 now inactive service displayed message, but allowed ordering to 
 proceed, with no service selected, was fixed.
  
 - For each of the screens where a treeview/combo box combination is 
 provided for service selection, there was a bug where selecting a 
 service from the treeview which contained a trailing space would 
 fail to find the matching service in the combo box.  This has been 
 corrected.
  
 - In several actions related to consults, a treeview of the service 
 hierarchy is built to accompany a combo box containing the services 
 and any synonyms.  There was a bug in the treeview code that most 
 likely had an impact on the time required to build the tree and 
 open the related form.  This bug was corrected, but the degree of 
 improvement will not be known until tested in actual use. 
 (MAR-0402-20887)
  
 - When ordering consults, quick orders were selectable from the 
 combo box, but not from the treeview.  This has been corrected.
  
 - Continued reports of the Consults Prerequisites screen not 
 behaving correctly on a CANCEL action led to trying a different 
 approach to fixing it.  The same fix should apply to selection of 
 a quick order containing an inactive consults service.  These 
 problems have so far not been reproducible in a development account, 
 so these fixes are tentative at best.
  
 - It was possible to store consults service and urgency values of 
 "0" when forwarding a consult or procedure.  This has been corrected.
  
 - New icons have been added to differentiate between interfacility 
 and local consult/procedure requests.
  
 - The Icon Legend screen for the Consults tab has been changed to 
 refer to "Documents" rather than "Notes".
  
 - Fixed problem where canceling from Prerequisites display screen 
 did not terminate ordering process.
  
 - Fixed problem where existing quick order with now inactive service 
 displayed message, but allowed ordering to proceed, with no service 
 selected.
  
 -- REPORTS
  
 - GCPR changes:
      In the list of remote sites, that is presented when the 
 'Remote Data' button is pressed, the DoD site has been changed 
 from DoD to Dept. of Defense.
      At the present time only 7 of all the reports on the Reports 
 tab are capable of retrieving DoD data.  To help the user identify 
 these reports a new item has been added to the list of reports in 
 the treeview, on the left side of the screen, called 'Dept. of 
 Defense Reports.'  This item is arranged in the following manner:
         Depart. of Defense Reports
             Laboratory
                 Lab Orders
                 Chem & Hematology
                 Surgical Pathology
                 Cytology
                 Microbiology
             Pharmacy All Outpatient
             Radiology Report
      The 'Dept. of Defense Reports' [ORRPW DOD] item will be added 
 to the package level parameter ORWRP REPORT LIST during installation 
 of this patch.  It will be left up to each site using GCPR to add 
 this report to individual users or to the SYSTEM level of the ORWRP 
 REPORT LIST parameter.  Here is the sequence of where this report 
 will be installed at the Package level:
      Sequence                             Value
      --------                             -----

 - NOIS MOU-0102-30322, NHM-1201-10084:
      A new field called MAXIMUM DAYS BACK was added to the OE/RR 
 REPORTS (101.24) file in a previous patch to restrict report queries 
 to a set number of days.  This was done because some reports may 
 take a very long time to build if the date range is to wide, and 
 more critical was the amount of disk storage required to build 
 some reports like the BCMA Med History Report.  In the previous 
 patch, this new field was only being used when the report was 
 initially built upon selection.  It was still possible for a user 
 to select another date range, on the fly, that ignored the MAXIMUM 
 DAYS BACK parameter.  This has been corrected in 2 ways:  1) The 
 user will no longer be able to select a date range beyond the value 
 stored in the MAXIMUM DAYS BACK field.  2) If a remote query is 
 invoked, the value at the remote site for MAXIMUM DAYS BACK will be 
 used regardless of the date range passed in from the remote query.
  
 - NOIS V01-1101-N1872: The 'Active Outpatient Medications' report in 
 'Clinical Reports' on the Reports tab has the columns '[+]' and 'SIG' 
 switched in the display.  This patch corrects this problem.
  
 - NOIS ANN-0202-41190: When printing Outpatient pharmacy reports from 
 the Clinical Reports menu, much of the information in the grid is left 
 off the report.  This has been corrected by limiting the number of 
 fields printed on the report.  The 2 reports affected are 'Active 
 Outpatient' [ORRPW PHARMACY ACT OUT] and 'All Outpatient' [ORRPW 
 PHARMACY ALL OUT].  The fields printed will now be:
 Facility     Drug           RX #       Qty      Rem        SIG
  
 - NOIS ATG-0202-32015: When creating a test group of labs in the 
 worksheet, it is very unclear to the user that only 7 labs are 
 allowed in a test group.  The "New" button is grayed out and is 
 not selectable until the group is below the allowable 7.  To fix 
 this, an instruction box has been added to the window.
  
 - NOIS WRJ-1001-10218: When selecting a date range value in a 
 component in Clinical Reports, and then selecting another 
 component, the date range is not "sticking" (instead it defaults 
 back to a stored 'initial date range' parameter for the selected 
 report.  This nuance was introduced with v16 of the GUI when 
 WebTop functionality was integrated into CPRS, but has proved to 
 be counter-intuitive to the user, leading to confusion on what date 
 range is being used when selecting different reports.  This patch 
 changes the functionality of date range selection to be more 
 consistent with prior versions of CPRS.  The initial date range 
 for a report (where applicable) will be the 'stored' date range 
 parameter for the reports.  (Users can get to these parameters 
 from the TOOLS menu in CPRS.)  If a user selects a different date 
 range, from the Date Range selection box, the new date range 
 will be used for any subsequent reports selected, until another 
 date range is selected.
  
 - NOIS HAM-0202-22145: When trying to reprint a work copy for a 
 pharmacy order that has a parent/child relationship, nothing prints.  
 This problem was introduces with the implementation of complex 
 ordering in Inpatient Meds, as part of the POE project.  This 
 patch will allow a work copy reprint of the subcomponents of 
 the order (children).  The parent cannot be reprinted, because 
 it is hidden from view when the order is released/signed.
  
 - NOIS LEX-0102-41973,
        SHE-0302-50252,
        WRJ-0202-11149,
        BHH-1001-42095,
        SPO-1101-51218,
        TAM-0800-30198,
        OKL-0801-70209,
        JAC-0801-72936:
 The above-referenced NOIS refer to an error occurring in the GUI 
 when trying to access lab data on the Lab tab, using the 'Most 
 Recent ' report option.  Under certain circumstances and error 
 occurs with the following message 'Not a valid floating point.'  
 This usually occurs when a CH & MI subscripted test shares the 
 same collection date/time and has been entered as a 'Not performed' 
 test.  This patch should fix this problem.
  
 - NOIS STC-0102-43218: For the Imaging (local only) report, the 
 set of Time/Occurrence will depend on the parameter ORWRP TIME/
 OCC LIMIT INDV and ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMIT ALL, if these two 
 parameters don't have any value about Imaging (local only), 
 then the value of ORCH CONTEXT REPORT will be count. 
  
 -- MEDS
  
 - For BCMA sites, selecting Medication Administration History 
 resulted in a server error.  This has been corrected.
  
 - For OutPatient Meds orders, if a default location level Route 
 had been set, it will be retrieved instead of the system level 
 Route setting.
  
 - A user placed an IV order, and if the order's schedule had been 
 edited by a Pharmacist through the back door, the changed schedule 
 would not be displayed in the order text on Meds tab. This has 
 been addressed.
  
 --ORDERS
  
 - NOIS CPH-0700-42307, DUR-1001-32175: When an order is selected 
 and "Alert when Results " is chosen from the Action menu, the user 
 is now prompted for Alert Recipient.  The Alert Recipient is the 
 user who will get the alert when the order is resulted (if the 
 Alert Recipient has the ORDERER-FLAGGED RESULTS notification/alert 
 enabled).  The default entry for Alert Recipient is the current 
 user.  Previous to v19, the alert recipient was always the order's 
 ordering provider.  
  
 - NOIS WPB-0298-32525, CIN-0499-41514: When an order is selected 
 and "Flag" is chosen from the Action menu, the user is now prompted 
 for Alert Recipient.  The Alert Recipient is the user who will get 
 the alert because the order was flagged for clarification.  (If the 
 Alert Recipient has the FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION notification/
 alert enabled.)  The default entry for Alert Recipient is the 
 current user.  
  
 - NOIS-0102-41805: The scroll bar was restored to the provider 
 comment box in the PS MEDS dialog.
  
 - NOIS-0302-20833: The arrow key works in the correct order in the 
 PS MEDS dialog.
  
 - NOIS-0302-20836: The cursor was not appearing in the IV ordering 
 dialog as expected. This has been addressed.
  
 - NOIS-0302-51009: The outpatient pharmacy quick order quantities 
 appeared to be limited to 9,999.  The quantity limit is now 32766.
  
 - NOIS WRJ-0202-11131, BUT-0202-21691: When a user placed an order, 
 a "list index out of bounds" error occurred sporadically. This 
 problem, caused by the disable of a Quick Order on the Mumps side, 
 has been fixed in this version.
  
 - NOIS DAY-0102-40752, LOM-0202-62565: If a user created a 
 Quick Order without an orderable item tied to it, a mumps error 
 "The variable OI is undefined" could occur in CPRS when the user 
 placed the Quick Order. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS CLE-0102-41202: The Meds route window in the medication 
 order dialog was too narrow to display the default of 
 INTRAMUSCULAR/INTRAVENOUS for an orderable item.  To fix this 
 problem, only INTRAMUSCULAR now displays in the med route window.  
  
 - NOIS CLE-0302-41265: For Quick Orders, if an orderable item 
 has a default schedule tied to it, the schedule will be entered 
 into the QO dialog's Schedule field.
  
 - NOIS HIN-0202-42336: For an IV quick order, if no dosage is 
 selected or an additive dosage equals zero, the order will not 
 be accepted. 
  
 - NOIS FAR-0302-41285: When transferring an Inpatient order to 
 an Outpatient order, the refill field will be edit-able.
  
 - NOIS HUN-1001-22059: If a Quick order in an OrderSet requires 
 a DEA key, it cannot be created by a user who does not have a 
 DEA key.
  
 - NOIS RIC-0202-22286: If an orderable item is inactivated, the 
 QO for that orderable item will not be created.
  
 - E3R 16998: Providers have requested that the accept and quit 
 buttons on the lower right of the ordering menus be separated.  
 At times they are accidentally hitting the quit instead of the 
 accept button.  Vertically-aligned buttons have been moved 
 further apart, as screen real estate allows.  For Horizontally-
 aligned buttons, the QUIT button has been made smaller to help 
 give the user a visual cue.
  
 - For complex med orders, in the duration field a user can now 
 click the down-arrow button to select a different duration from 
 a popup menu of Days, Months, Weeks, Hours, and Minutes.  
  
 - When renewing a complex order, the Sig was not being displayed 
 correctly.  This has been addressed.  
  
 -- PATIENT SELECTION
  
 -- SAVING CLINIC DEFAULT SETTINGS DURING PATIENT SELECTION: In a 
 previous release, a dialogue was added which only appeared from 
 the patient selection screen when the user clicked on the "Save 
 Patient List Settings" button, and then only when the default that 
 had been selected was a "Clinic."  The dialogue that appeared 
 asked the user whether to save the default clinic for only the 
 current day, or for all days of the week.  An additional choice 
 has now been added: "Cancel" which allows the user to cancel 
 saving the default setting.  
  
 Allergy Entry
 When a user entered a search term that was a synonym, and a matching 
 entry was found in the VA ALLERGIES file, the text returned in the 
 treeview included the synonym in angle brackets, as in "Penicillin 
 <PCN>".  When the order was accepted, this same text was passed to the 
 ART package.  Since the concatenated synonym prevented location of a 
 matching entry, the allergy was stored as free text, and not linked to 
 other related files.  This issue prevented order checks from occurring in 
 some cases, and has now been corrected.
