Description:
============

 This patch will contain the following changes: 
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS 
 ===============
 MOU-1004-31195 (HD# 68348)
                                                                      
 ASSOCIATED E3R 
 ==============
 n/a 
                                                               
 508 Compliance
 ==============
 The CPUser executable is not 508 compliant.
 Working with the 508 team to establish 508 compliance.
 508 Compliance is underway and will be in a future patch.
 
                                                                     
 CPManager.exe 
  
 1. The field in the CPManager parameters screen  Imaging Network 
    Share has been changed to read CP/BGP Transfer Directory which
    stands for Clinical Procedures Background Processor to better
    explain the purpose of the data in that field.  
  
 2. Added Warning screen to inform the user of the implications of 
    adding a new instrument without contacting Enterprise VistA Support
    (EVS). 
                                                            
 3. A reference to National VistA Support (NVS) was in the CRC Values,
    Version Compatibility, and Imaging File Types tab descriptions of
    the System Parameter.  The references were changed to EVS.
  
 CPUser.exe 
  
 1. When selecting a patient by Ward Location, the ward that had the
    first internal entry number in the Ward Location file in the 
    retrieved list from VistA was not displayed. This has been fixed 
    so that all valid wards are displayed in the list from the remote 
    procedure call.
    NOIS: MOU-1004-31195 
  
 2. When Checking in a patient the list of Consults/Procedures and 
    the list of Outpatient Visits are now automatically sorted in 
    reverse order to show the latest orders at the top of the list.  
  
 3. When selecting a Consults/Procedure for check-in a second check 
    is performed to see if that procedure has already been checked in. 
    If the procedure has been previously checked-in an Information 
    screen is displayed showing the number of times it has been 
    checked in.  
 
 Miscellaneous
 
 1. The Implementation Guide was changed with a more detailed
    description and usage of a COUNT and a NON-COUNT Clinic.

 DOCUMENTATION: 
 =============
 There are change pages for the Clinical Procedures User Manual and
 Implementation Guide that document the enhancement provided by this patch.
 The change pages are in files MD_1_P4_UM.PDF, MD_1_P4_UM.DOC, MD_1_P4_IMPG.PDF,
 and MD_1_P4_IMPG.DOC.  The complete User Manual and Implementation Guide that
 contain the change pages are in files CLINPROC1_UM.PDF, CLINPROC1_UM.DOC,
 CLINPROC1_IMPG.PDF, and CLINPROC1_IMPG.DOC.
   
  The following files can be retrieved in 
  BINARY format by File Transfer Protocol (FTP): 
  MD1_0P4.ZIP      (GUI applications and KIDS build) 
  MD_1_P4_UM.PDF   (Change Pages)  
  MD_1_P4_UM.DOC   (Change Pages) 
  MD_1_P4_IMPG.PDF (Change Pages)

  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov    
  
  which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.  
  
  The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP 
  location at the following locations.  
  
         Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov 
         Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov 
         Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
  
  Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
                                                                           
 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL
 ==================
 MD1_0P4.zip file contains the following application files:
  CPManager.exe
  CPUser.exe
  MD1_0P4.KID
  CPManager.hlp
  CPUser.hlp
  CPManager.cnt
  CPUser.cnt
  
 The files can be extracted from the MD1_0P4.zip file into the
 following directory:
           
        "C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures"
 
 The following application files will replace the existing application 
 files in "C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures" directory:
  
  CPManager.exe
  CPUser.exe
  CPManager.hlp
  CPUser.hlp
  CPManager.cnt
  CPUser.cnt
 
 Use FTP and transfer the KIDS build in ASCII file format from the
 "C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures" directory for installation.
                                                                          
 If you are running the software from a server, you should move the 
 following application files to the server:
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\CPManager.exe
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\CPUser.exe
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\Help\CPManager.hlp
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\Help\CPManager.cnt
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\Help\CPUser.hlp
     C:\Program Files\vista\Clinical Procedures\Help\CPUser.cnt
                      
 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
 ==========================
  Users may remain on the system but this patch should be installed at 
  non-peak hours due to the high volume use of the routines included.  
  Installation should take less than 3 minutes.  
  
     1. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
        select the Installation menu. 
     2. From this menu, use Load a Distribution option.
     3. When prompted "Enter a Host File:", enter MD1_0P4.KID.
     4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*4): 
              a.  Backup a Transport Global 
              b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
              c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the patch MD*1.0*4 
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
        install? YES//", respond NO 
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
        Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond NO.
 
  Client GUI applications can be extracted from the MD1_0P4.zip file. 
  These files (CPUser.exe and CPManager.exe) should replace the existing 
  application files of the current system.
 
  By replacing the existing application (.exe) files on your system, 
  the shortcuts on your desktop along with their command line switches
  will remain set correctly. If you accidentally delete your CP shortcuts, 
  you must reset the command line switches to be as they were when CP was
  first installed. Refer to the CP Implementation Guide, Appendix A - CP
  Application Startup Options and Command Line Switches for information 
  on resetting the command line switches on your shortcuts.
