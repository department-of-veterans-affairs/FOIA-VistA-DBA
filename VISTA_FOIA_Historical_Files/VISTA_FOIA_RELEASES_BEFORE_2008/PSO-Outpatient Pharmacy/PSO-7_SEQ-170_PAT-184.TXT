Subject: RETURN TO STOCK AND CONTROLLED SUB ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  1. MOU-1203-30359
     When using the Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK]
     option for a controlled substance, the pharmacist is allowed to
     up-arrow ("^") out of the comments field even though it is a
     required field.  When this happens, some Controlled Substance
     files are partially updated and will cause the medication to be
     returned twice.  This patch will resolve this issue by not allowing
     the pharmacist to up-arrow out of the comments field.
     
  2. SHE-0404-51324
     The potential exists to modify the number of refills for a
     controlled substance from a maximum of 5 to 11.  This can happen
     in the Patient Processing Option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] while
     finishing a renewed order.
  
  3. DAY-0604-41287
     An issue was identified in the Imaging software that allowed the
     software to automatically select a patient based on name even if
     multiple patients existed with the same name.  A fix is being
     included in Pharmacy to new the DIQUIET internal variable to prevent
     this behavior.  This change does not affect the pharmacy application
     in any way.
  
  4. CLL-0604-40968
     When using the Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK]
     option it is possible to get the following message:
     
     Original Fill CANNOT be Returned!
     This fill entered before installation of version 6.  There are no
     refills.
     
     This message is generated when the pharmacist try's to return a
     medication to stock for a prescription that has a fill date that
     is less than the date Version 6.0 of the Outpatient Pharmacy
     application was installed.  This message will be removed.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
  
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*184) 
  
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*184.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
