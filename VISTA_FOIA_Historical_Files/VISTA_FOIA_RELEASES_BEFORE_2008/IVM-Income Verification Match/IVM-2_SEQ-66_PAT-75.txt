   OVERVIEW
   ========
  
   The purpose of the Geographic Means Testing Phase II project is to define
   the functionality required to implement automation to support the concept
   of a new category of veterans being termed User Enrollees.
  
   Veterans who do not utilize the VA health care system will not be required
   to submit financial information on an annual basis.  Assessment of
   financial status is only considered necessary for veterans who are
   actually utilizing their health care benefits, that is - receiving care
   through VA.  VHA will establish the concept of the "User Enrollee" to be
   utilized for enrollment communication purposes.
  
   This project addresses the identification of the User Enrollee and
   subsequent changes to reflect the business process of only sending MT
   renewals and GMT conversion communications to those veterans identified as
   User Enrollees.
  
   The Geographic Means Testing Phase II project will flag veterans who are
   actively using the system through appointments, Fee Basis authorizations,
   or Encounters as User Enrollees.  The user enrollee information will be
   shared with the Health Eligibility Center, who will share the same
   information with all sites of record.  Means Test renewal letters and GMT
   conversion letters will only be sent to veterans who are designated as user
   enrollees by the site that so designated the veteran.
  
   A one-time seeding of the user enrollee data by each site will be done.
   A Z07 HL7 message will be sent to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) for
   each veteran designated as a User Enrollee.  After the HEC receives the one-
   time seeding from all VISTA sites, the user enrollee data will be 
   synchronized with all sites of record by triggering a Z11 HL7 message for
   each veteran.
  
   The software for this patch, IVM*2*75, and associated patches,  are
   being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file
   DG_53_P497.KID). This patch contains the informational portion of
   IVM*2*75 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to
   acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
   The enhancements are being distributed in several patches that will be
   installed in three phases as outlined below:

   FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
   ======================
   The functionality that will be introduced with this patch is the modification
   of the background process of HL7 messages to support the sharing of the 
   User Enrollee fields and will not be visible by users.
  
  
   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
   =====================
   New sequences for User Enrollee data are being added to ZEL segment of 
   Z07 HL7 message. This modification will allow User Enrollee data to 
   transmit to HEC via Z07 HL7 message. This functionality is not visible
   to users.
