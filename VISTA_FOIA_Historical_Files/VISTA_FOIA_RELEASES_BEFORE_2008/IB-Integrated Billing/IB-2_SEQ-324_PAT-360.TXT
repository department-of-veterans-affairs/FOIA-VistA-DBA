Subject: REASONABLE CHARGES UPDATE V2.8

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ************************************************************************
 Until the following steps are completed, the charges that are currently 
 being used are the latest active charges.  For new (v2.8) charges, you
 need to load the charges that come with this patch.
        
 1) The installation of this patch from the KIDS menu (see below) will 
 inactivate Reasonable Charges V2.7, effective 09/30/06. This will leave 
 the billing department with no valid charges for Event Dates after 
 09/30/06.
  
 2) Then, after this patch is installed, IRM or the Billing department 
 needs to load the new charges for each division.  The effective date will
 be 10/01/06.
         
 Step 2 needs to be done as soon as possible after Step 1, or billing 
 will likely have problems getting rates to drop on a claim.  To 
 facilitate this, you should have already retrieved and placed the 6 rates 
 files noted in the UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS portion of this document, prior to 
 installing the patch.
      
 All of the Installation and Update instructions are contained in this 
 patch description.
     
 Note: If the new charges are loaded prior to the install of ICD*18*24
 you will receive errors during the upload process (about a few new DRG 
 codes not being on the system). Although it is not mandatory, it is highly
 recommended that ICD*18*24 be installed prior to the upload of the new
 charges to avoid having to upload the charges twice.
 ************************************************************************
      
 Reasonable Charges version 2.8 is a charge update to the existing
 Reasonable Charges billed to Third Party Payers.  This patch contains 
 new DRG charges and new SNF Per Diem charges. All other charges 
 have their effective date updated.  
      
 Effective Date of Reasonable Charges v2.8 is 10/01/06.  
    
 The Reasonable Charges v2.7 loaded on your system will be inactivated 
 with an inactivation date of 09/30/06 when this patch is installed.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD1129611           2007 DRG Grouper Update Request
    
    Problem:
    --------           
    Changes in the national DRG rates need to be distributed to all
    hospitals so that proper billing can take place.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    This patch updates the Reasonable Charges files and distributes
    them with a new version number and a new effective date.
    
 Technical Description
 =====================
 This patch exports 3 routines, one of which is the post-init (IBYPSI).
    
 The post-init will complete the following:
    
 1.  Inactivate all existing Reasonable Charges defined in the Charge 
     Master.  Reasonable Charges v2.7 will be inactivated with an inactivation 
     date of 09/30/06 when this patch is installed.
    
 The following is an example of the post-init portion of the installation.  
    
     Reasonable Charges v2.8 Post-Install .....
    
       >> Inactivating Existing Reasonable Charges, Please Wait...
          Done.  166328 existing charges inactivated
    
     Reasonable Charges v2.8 Post-Install Complete
    
 Note:  The actual number of charges inactivated will vary based on the 
 number of divisions billed at your site.  This will also determine the
 time required for the installation.
    
    
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
   
   This patch can be installed with users on the system, however two 
   options will need to be disabled (see step 4).
   
   Install Time - less than 30 minutes. This time will vary from site to 
   site depending on the size of the Charge Item (#363.2) file.  
   
   Loading the Charge Master (step 4 of the Upload process) is separate 
   from the patch installation and will take additional time per division.

        ------------------------------
        Follow the instructions below.
     
     
   RC Version 2.8 UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
   ==================================
   After patch installation, the RC v2.8 (Reasonable Charges v2.8) charges
   for each division billed at a site will need to be loaded into the Charge
   Master.  
      
   The charges for each Division will require approximately 1.8 - 2.0 MB of
   disk space. Other files will be searched, but the updates will be made to
   the Charge Item (#363.2) file.
      
   Files Required for Upload:
   ==========================
   The charge files are available on the following CIO Field Offices' 
   Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability to 
   retrieve the files (ASCII).
   =============================================================================
       
   OI FIELD OFFICE          FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY

   IBRC0610F.TXT        Site Identification
      
      
   Upload Steps:
   =============
      
   Step 1:  Get Host Files
   -----------------------
   Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v2.8 Host Files in ASCII format (see 
   previous section).
      
   Step 2:  Determine Divisions
   ----------------------------
   Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
   print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and
   Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions
   that will need new charges loaded.
      
   Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
   -----------------------------
   Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option
   to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
   care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for
   each Billing Region. 
   You will see the prompt:
                  
        Select one of the following:
         
              1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
              1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
              1.3       Load RC into XTMP
              1.4       Load TP into XTMP
              2         Assign Charge Set
              3         Check Data Validity
              4         Load into Charge Master
              5         Delete XTMP files
    
   Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of
   selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and waiting until 4 stops before 
   continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output
   for future reference).
      
   Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
   ---------------------------------------
   From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
      
   This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
   for individual Divisions.
      
     - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask
       which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
       Select 2.8
      
     - When loading Reasonable Charges v2.8, the IBRC0610x.TXT files may be
       used for multiple divisions without reloading.  
      
     - If there exist any previously calculated charges (files) for a division,
       they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
          The above files already exist in XTMP.
          Delete the above files and continue with upload?
       Select Yes to delete the previously calculated charges.
      
     - If there exist any previously loaded host files for any RC version,
       they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
       Select No if the files are IBRC0610x.TXT since these are the 
       correct files for v2.8 and you would not want to delete them.
       Select Yes only if the files are from a different version.
      
     - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
       This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing
       Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
       selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
      
   Step 5: Check Data Validity
   --------------------------------------
   This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for
   the first division loaded.
   From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
   If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the 
   latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.  The Error key at the 
   end of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply 
   provides definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the 
   individual line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors 
   have been detected.
    
   Step 6: Load into Charge Master
   ------------------------------------------
   From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
   Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
   Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
      
   It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
   upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
   another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
   complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the 
   charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded
   serially.  
      
   Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
   -------------------------------------------------
   Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer
   to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
   Region Report list determined previously.
      
   In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
   Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
   -  Option 1.3, selection 2, to calculate RC v2.8 charges for a division
   -  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
      permanent files.
    
   However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
   have changed it's division number, then extra care is needed to ensure
   the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide
   some additional information about the upload.
    
 ================ Reasonable Charges v2.8 Upload Information ==============
  
   
  The Charge Host Files should load with the following counts:
   
  IBRC0610A.TXT RC v2.8 Host File Upload, 9/26/06@15:37 by ADES,ROBER   537
  IBRC0610B.TXT RC v2.8 Host File Upload, 9/26/06@15:37 by ADES,ROBER   5695
