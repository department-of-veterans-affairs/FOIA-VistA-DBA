Description: 
============

  Y2K Waiver Request ID#:  Y2KW0001        Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
         This patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium, either
         BEFORE 12/15/99 or AFTER 1/15/2000.
         This patch MAY NOT be installed between 12/15/1999 and 1/15/2000
         (the Y2K Lockdown Period).
  
  This patch contains 3 improvements.
 
  1. Sites that are scheduled to integrate with a primary site can begin
  printing the station number in front of the Internal Entry Number (IEN)
  on the ZEBRA barcode labels.  As released labels would print only the
  IEN as a barcode for the selected medication. After this patch labels
  will be formatted as SiteNumber-IEN if the parameter PSB DEFAULT BARCODE
  SITE is set to yes.
  
  2. Use a different server name for the monthly SAGG reporting. Sites will
  notice no change with the SAGG update.
 
    Old Server: KMP1-BCMA-SERVER@ISC-ALBANY.VA.GOV
    New Server: KMP90-BCMA-SERVER@ISC-ALBANY.VA.GOV
  
  3. Further enhancements were done so the One-Time medications do not 
  appear on the Virtual Due List by discontinuing the order without having
  to mark the order as 'Do Not Give'.
