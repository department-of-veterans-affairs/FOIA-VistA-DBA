Subject: RESOLVE AUSTIN DATA PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

    1)  Visit record length in Austin transmission message was invalid when
        appointment time had number appended to maintain uniqueness within 
        OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68)  (e.g., 2980810.131547 where 47
        is appended).  Post installation routine (HBHCPS12) deletes &       
        regenerates all fiscal year 1998 visit data.  Site will transmit       
        updated data to Austin per HBPC User Information instructions       
        (listed below). 
 
      Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMV, HBHCPS12
 
 
    2)  Potential HBHC VISIT file (#632) cross-reference corruption due to
        incorrect call to ^DIK.
  
      Solution/Routine(s) changed:  re-index all cross-references on HBHC  
      VISIT file (#632), HBHCAPPT routine
   
  
    3)  Handle potential incorrect 3rd piece of the 0 node in HBHC VISIT
        file (#632) which could cause valid data node to be overwritten. 
 
      Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCAPPT
 
 
    4)  Strengthen error checking process to guard against corrupt data in 
        OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68).

    Only HBPC  (Home Based Primary Care, formerly HBHC Hospital Based   
    Home Care)  users need to be off the system.  Patch installation time
    should be minimal.  There is no recommended time of day for
    installation.  Queued post installation routine (HBHCPS12) may take
    several hours to complete.  IRM will receive a mail message upon
    completion.

    HBPC User Information:
    =====================
 
    Background info on 2 Austin data problems:
 
    Problem 1:  zeroes in some total columns on Austin COIN DMS149 report 
 
    Explanation:
      Austin data was not being accumulated properly from 1 processing cycle
      to next
 
    Resolution:  Austin software has been fixed
 
 
    Problem 2:  missing Admissions/Discharges (D/Cs) & Visits for May thru
                July 
 
    Explanation:
      Since HBHC Patch 10 was installed, in certain circumstances a software
      bug created an invalid visit record length in the Austin transmission
      message.  When an invalid visit was encountered, the entire Austin
      message containing 100 records was not processed.  (see HBHC User 
      Manual page 76 for 100 record message information, if needed) 
      Admission/Discharge & valid Visit records were discarded along with
      invalid visits.  This problem makes Austin's data incomplete.
  
    Resolution:
      Austin is working with us to accomplish the following data update.
 
      HBHC software patch 12 will discard & re-create the entire 1998 fiscal
      year visit data, since determining which visits were missing would be 
      extremely time consuming. 
 
      HBPC sites will need to re-flag any admission/discharge records with  
      days of care in fiscal year 1998 that Austin does not have on the latest
      COIN DSM157 report from Austin.  (Remember the HBPC Data Alert (yellow
      sheet) received from Bonnie Ryan, with follow-up message from Mary
      Thomas saying hold off until you're notified?  This is your
      notification!)  See User Steps below for instructions.
 
      Sites will perform the same steps as always to 'Build' & 'Transmit'
      to Austin.  The re-flagged Admission/Discharge records will be
      included.  This patch automatically adds the re-created visits to the
      transmit file. 
 
      An additional transmit cycle to Austin may be necessary depending on 
      when this patch is released.  Sites will be informed by e-mail to the
      HBPC Program Directors mail group of the details if this is needed. 
      Please keep alert to this possibility!
 
      Additional things to note:
        -  patch routine that re-creates visit data may take awhile to 
           complete due to amount of data being processed
 
        -  any old HBHC reports for fiscal year 1998 may not reconcile 
           against reports printed once patch 12 has been installed
 
      
   User Steps:
   ==========
 
    ***  Note:
      Please understand your PROMPT attention to this patch & resolution is
      critical to ensure Austin's HBHC data is complete & accurate prior to 
      fiscal year 1998 close out in October
 
    1)  ensure patch 12 is installed & has run to completion  (IRM will
        receive a mail message when complete & should notify you) 
 
    2)  excerpt from Bonnie's HBPC Data Alert message:
     -  Sites should check their Admission/D/C master (COIN DMS157) list from
        Austin against their local HBHC Episode of Care/Length of Stay report
 
        Any discrepancies should be corrected as follows: 
 
        -  Use latest Austin Admission/D/C report
 
        -  Run local HBHC Episode of Care/Length of Stay Report [HBHCRP12]
           using earliest admission as beginning date, thru current date 
 
        Note:  there will be episodes of care on local report that have no 
               days of care in FY98, although Austin's contains FY98
 
           -  Little Rock (alpha test site) did the following report
              matching using 2 different color highlighters 
              -  highlight all pre-FY98 episodes in one color (e.g., green)
              -  highlight all Active entries in Discharge Date column & all 
                 FY98 episodes in another color (e.g., yellow)
              -  compare all 'yellow' entries on local list with Austin
                 list, checking off entries that Austin has, ensure episode 
                 dates match if multiple patient episodes
              -  any 'yellow' entries not checked should be re-flagged
 
        -  Reset Transmit Status Flag on all episodes on local report that
           are missing from Austin report, using Evaluation/Admission Data
           Entry [HBHCADM] option  (see example on pages 22-23 in HBHC User
           Manual) 
 
           Note:  resetting the flag under Admission will also reset any
                  corresponding D/C
 
    3)  generate Austin transmit file using the following option sequence:
            -  run Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE], setting Number
               of Visit Days to Scan system parameter to 365 (software will
               omit pre-FY98 dates)
            -  print Form Errors Report [HBHCRP1]
            -  correct visit errors
            -  Edit Form Errors Data [HBHCUPD]
            -  repeat sequence as needed
  
    4)  Once 'No errors found' message is received, then Transmit File to
        Austin [HBHCXMT], regardless if it's the proper time of the month or
        not
