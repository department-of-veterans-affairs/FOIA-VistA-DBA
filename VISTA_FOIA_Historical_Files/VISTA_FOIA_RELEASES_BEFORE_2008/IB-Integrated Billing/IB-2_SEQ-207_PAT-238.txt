 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================
    
 1. PUG-0403-50885  Electronic Type not included when moving Ins Plans
    
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    
 1. PUG-0403-50885
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When moving subscribers of one plan/group to another plan/group using
    the Move Subscribers to a Different Plan [IBCN MOVE SUBSCRIB TO PLAN]
    option, there is no opportunity to input the ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE 
    (#.15) field of the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) file.
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE field is being added to the display of the
    'FROM' plan and to the editable field list of the 'TO' plan.  This
    will allow the user to enter the appropriate data without having to
    go to a different menu option.  
    
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
    
 1.  RE:  PUG-0403-50885
     One line of code is inserted into routine IBCNSUR2 to display the
     ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE field.
   W !,?11,"ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE:   ",$$EXPAND^IBTRE(355.3,.15,$P(IBP0,U,15))
    
     Field number .15 is added to the DR string for editing the 'TO' plan.
   S DR=".09;.15;I $P($G(^IBE(355.1,+$P($G(^IBA(355.3,DA,0)),U,9),0)),U,3)...
