Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*106
  
 Y2K Waiver Exemption ID: Y2KWE0010
  
 NOIS:  IVM-1099-31783, IVM-1099-33078
 Test Site:  HEC, Atlanta, GA
  
 There seems to be a problem with getting a lock sometimes, when attempting to
 file a message into or delete a message from a basket.  This patch
 removes MailMan's locks and lets FileMan handle the locking.  If FileMan
 can't get the lock, MailMan will keep calling Fileman until FileMan
 succeeds.
  
 Also in this patch:
 ^XMXBSKT  - When resequencing messages in a basket, use local create date.
 ^XMXSEND  - Additional code to ensure message recycling functions correctly.
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.
