 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
    1. NYH-0102-12550     EXEMPT INT/ADM MULTIPLE TIMES
  
       Problem:
       -------
       Multiple exempt interest/admin. transactions could be generated
       when two users adjusted the costs on the same bill at the same
       time in the Administrative Cost Adjustment [PRCAF ADJ ADMIN]
       option.
    
       Resolution
       ----------
       Modified routine PRCAEXM to put the lock on a bill so the 
       adjustments can be applied to the bill only once.
  
    2. PHO-0702-62860      Receipt Problem
   
       Problem:
       --------
       A site was having a problem with the Receipt Processing software 
       under the Agent Cashier menu. The user didn't see his name
       appearing on the receipt profile after he edited the payment. It
       would be better if the receipt showed the initials for whoever
       else edited the bill as well as opened the bill.
   
       Resolution:
       -----------
       Modified 3 routines to add the person's initials who changed the
       receipt to the receipt profile screen. Modified the header to
       distinguish the person who opens the receipt and the person who
       edits the receipt.
  
       This patch adds a new field to the sub file in the AR BATCH PAYMENT
       file (#344) called EDITED BY (#.14). This field will be used to 
       record the identity of person who edited the payment so that it can
       be displayed on the receipt profile screen.
  
       An environment check routine will be used to check if site has a
       CoreFLS version of software and recommend not to install this patch
       unless an accompanying update is made to the AR-CoreFLS software
       immediately after installation of this patch.
