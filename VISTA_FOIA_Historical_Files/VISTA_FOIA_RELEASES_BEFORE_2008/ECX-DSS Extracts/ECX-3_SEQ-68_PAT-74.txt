 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 MIN-0804-41838: DSS VistA Extract Question
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The documentation for DSS (Decision Support System) VistA Extracts 
    Data Definitions is wrong.  It still says Accession Date, but about
    5 years ago it was changed to the Date Collected. File #727.813 --
    LABORATORY EXTRACT (LAB) Data Definition fields PRIMARY CARE TEAM (20)
    and PRIMARY CARE PROVIDE (21) mention ACCESSION DATE in the technical
    documentation.
  
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The fields that mention Accession Date in file LABORATORY EXTRACT (LAB)
    file (#727.813) are PRIMARY CARE TEAM(20) and PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (21). 
    The patch will change ACCESSION DATE to DATE COLLECTED. 
    The document: FY 2004 Data Definitions Guide and Extract File Formats
    will be updated with this change.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY:
 ================
 ACCESSION DATE in fields PRIMARY CARE TEAM (20) and PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (21) 
 in LABORATORY EXTRACT (LAB)file (#727.813) will be changed to DATE COLLECTED 
 in the technical description of the above fields.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended that
 it be queued to run after normal business hours.
   
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
   
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
   
     4. Select from the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*74)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
   
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*74.
   
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
   
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
   
   
     NOTE:  Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided 
     during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install File
     Print option on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation and
     Distribution System.
