 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD67727 - ISL-0903-52345  CONTRAST MEDIA ORDER CHECK PROBLEMS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users reported that the allergy bulletin is not firing when ordering
 a radiology procedure involving CONTRAST MEDIA, OTHER. The radiology
 order checking routine GMRARAD checks for VA DRUG CLASS values of
 DX100, DX010 and DX102.  CONTRAST MEDIA, OTHER is assigned to VA DRUG
 CLASS DX109 so it does not fire the bulletin.
 Duplicate ticket HD99674 identified a potential safety issue documented 
 in PSI-05-054. This patch will correct the issue.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 GMRARAD & GMRARAD1 will be modified to include VA DRUG CLASS DX109 which
 will trigger the allergy bulletin.
