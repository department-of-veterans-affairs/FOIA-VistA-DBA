Subject: SCHEDULING REPLACEMENT API MODIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch contains the following fixes to the Scheduling Replacement APIs:
  
  1.  API GETPLIST has been modified to correctly exclude cancelled 
      appointments, and to exclude appointments on the Hospital Location
      appointment sub-file (#44.001) that do not have a corresponding entry
      on the appointment multiple of the Patient appointment sub-file (#2.98).
      This API returns appointment data for a specific clinic IEN.
  2.  API NEXTAPPT has been modified to begin looking for the next 
      appointment after the current date/time rather than after midnight of
      the current day.  This API returns appointment data for a specific
      patient DFN.
  
  
  
  PATCH COMPONENTS:
  =================
  Routines SDAMA201 and SDAMA202.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be installed during peak hours.  Installation will take
  less than 1 minute.
  
  Note: SD*5.3*283 is a REQUIRED PATCH.  KIDS will not allow the installation
        of this patch without prior installation of SD*5.3*283.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*316):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
             backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
             (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
             allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
             the transport global.
   
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*316.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES??//', respond NO
  
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO
   
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
