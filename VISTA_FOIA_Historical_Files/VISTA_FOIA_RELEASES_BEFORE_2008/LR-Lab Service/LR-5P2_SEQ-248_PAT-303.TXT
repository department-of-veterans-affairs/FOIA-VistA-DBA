Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*303 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*303 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation
 of this patch.
  
 The Laboratory package, in support of the VA Health Data Repository (HDR)
 efforts, has developed the following reports to support VA Data
 Standardization of laboratory results. These reports/extracts will
 facilitate centralized mapping and data validation of National Laboratory
 Test (NLT) and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
 within VistA Laboratory.
  
 **************************************************************************
 This patch must be installed within five days of receipt in order to
 provide information to a centralized LOINC mapping team which will use
 this information to provide recommended NLT and LOINC mappings for CH
 subscript - chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, serology type
 results) used by each facility.  These recommendations will be sent back
 to the facility for review and action. Installation of this patch is for
 this reporting purpose only and has no effect on current laboratory
 functionality.
 **************************************************************************
  
   
 1. These LRLABSERVER server reports are available with this patch:
  
 LOCAL REPORT
  Send a message to: S.LRLABSERVER@domain name
            Subject:LOCAL REPORT
  
    The body of the message will be ignored.  This will scan the database
 for mapped LOINC data and return the results to the person sending the
 mail message request.
  
  
 LOCAL REPORT DELIMIT
   Send a message to: S.LRLABSERVER@domain name
             Subject: LOCAL REPORT DELIMIT
  
   The body of the message will be ignored. This will scan the database
 for mapped NLT and LOINC data. Results are returned to the person sending
 the mail message request. The extracted data is returned as an attached
 file in a delimited format using the "|" character as the field delimiter.

 RELMA
   Send a message to: S.LRLABSERVER@domain name
             Subject: RELMA
  
   The body of the message will be ignored. This will scan the local site's
 LABORATORY TEST file (#60) and ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY file (#62.06)
 and extract data in a format for input into the Regenstrief LOINC Mapping
 Assistant (RELMA) mapping tool. Results are returned to the person sending
 the mail message request. The extracted data is returned as an attached
 file in a delimited format using the "|" character as the field delimiter.

 2. Lab server mail messages will be purged after successful completion of
 the server request. Supported MailMan API ZAPSERV^XMXAPI will be called to
 delete the message from POSTMASTER server basket S.LRLABSERVER.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 -------------------------
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
         option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*303):
         a. Print Transport Global
         b. Backup a Transport Global
         c. Compare Transport Global to Current System
         d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
       Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*303'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
   6.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  Note: Routine LR303 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
