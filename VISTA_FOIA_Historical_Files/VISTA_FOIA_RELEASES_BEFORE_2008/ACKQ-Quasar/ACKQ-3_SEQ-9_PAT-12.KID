This patch addresses several issues that came up at the VAMC stations as
"BLD",1359,1,3,0)
a result of the initial release of the Audiometric Exam Module (patch
"BLD",1359,1,4,0)
ACKQ*3.0*3). These changes have been made to the GUI(Windows based)
"BLD",1359,1,5,0)
Enter/Edit(ACKQROES3E.EXE) and Display(ACKQROES3.EXE) applications in the
"BLD",1359,1,6,0)
package for both the CPRS Toolbar and Desktop versions, as well as to the
"BLD",1359,1,7,0)
VistA part of the application. The VistA part includes the file data
"BLD",1359,1,8,0)
dictionary, Remote Procedure Calls and routines.
"BLD",1359,1,9,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,10,0)
The Audiometric Exam Module was developed in conjunction with the Remote
"BLD",1359,1,11,0)
Order Entry System (ROES 3.0) at the VA Denver Distribution Center(DDC)
"BLD",1359,1,12,0)
and is only available to run in the Windows environment. The application
"BLD",1359,1,13,0)
can be installed completely from this patch, if ACKQ*3.0*3 was not
"BLD",1359,1,14,0)
installed. Users are encouraged to consult the full Installation Guide
"BLD",1359,1,15,0)
referenced below if AKCQ*3.0*3 was not installed. If ACKQ*3.0*3 was 
"BLD",1359,1,16,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,17,0)
installed, then installing the KIDS build and copying the new executables 
"BLD",1359,1,18,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,19,0)
over the original executables of the same name will complete
"BLD",1359,1,20,0)
the install.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
"BLD",1359,1,30,0)
 ----------------------------
"BLD",1359,1,31,0)
 Problem: When a user without context accessed the Edit Module, they were
"BLD",1359,1,32,0)
 allowed to enter the application and view the screens. They were not able
"BLD",1359,1,33,0)
 to actually edit the data.
"BLD",1359,1,34,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,35,0)
 Solution: The application [ACKQROES3E.EXE] was modified to exit and halt
"BLD",1359,1,36,0)
 the application if the user did not have the appropriate VistA
"BLD",1359,1,37,0)
 application assigned to create context.

 -----
"BLD",1359,1,44,0)
 Problem: Sites encountered a Null Subscript at EN2+4^ACKQAG02 when
"BLD",1359,1,45,0)
 entering a new record and cancels out of entering the date and time of
"BLD",1359,1,46,0)
 the exam.
"BLD",1359,1,47,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,48,0)
 Solution: A fix is applied in routine ACKQAG02 and in the record setup
"BLD",1359,1,49,0)
 to give the appropriate error message and exit the application if a valid
"BLD",1359,1,50,0)
 date and time are not entered.

 -----
"BLD",1359,1,55,0)
 Problem: Some error messages or message prompts were coming up behind
"BLD",1359,1,56,0)
 other screens. The only way for them to show up was to select the
"BLD",1359,1,57,0)
 application from the bottom task bar.
"BLD",1359,1,58,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,59,0)
 Solution: Most of the messages in the Audiogram Edit application are now
"BLD",1359,1,60,0)
 enclosed in code to send them to topmost position and after the message
"BLD",1359,1,61,0)
 ends, to restore the previous topmost setup.  This may not be a complete
"BLD",1359,1,62,0)
 solution, but available documentation indicates it should help, if not
"BLD",1359,1,63,0)
 eliminate the problem from this application.

This patch contains the following enhancements:
"BLD",1359,1,71,0)
===============================================
"BLD",1359,1,72,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,73,0)
The Audiometric Exam Module provided new functionality for Audiology and
"BLD",1359,1,74,0)
Speech Pathology Services(ASPS), to simplify and enhance the entry,
"BLD",1359,1,75,0)
display and use of information obtained during the Audiometric exam of a
"BLD",1359,1,76,0)
patient. This module is comprised of two distinct application functions:
"BLD",1359,1,77,0)
        Audiogram Edit function [ACKQROES3E.EXE]
"BLD",1359,1,78,0)
        Audiogram Display function [ACKQROES3.EXE]
"BLD",1359,1,79,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,80,0)
Records are stored in the local AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file (^ACK(509850.9).
"BLD",1359,1,81,0)
When signed, the records are also transmitted from this global to the DDC
"BLD",1359,1,82,0)
through the VistA Mailman system. At the DDC, data from these records is
"BLD",1359,1,83,0)
included with orders for hearing aids and repairs when the orders are
"BLD",1359,1,84,0)
placed through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package.
"BLD",1359,1,85,0)
They may also be viewed remotely from the ROES Patient Information screen
"BLD",1359,1,86,0)
of the ROES web application.
"BLD",1359,1,87,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,88,0)
ACKQ*3.0*12 implements the following changes:
"BLD",1359,1,89,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,90,0)
 1. Removal of Buttons
"BLD",1359,1,91,0)
 In both audiogram GUI applications, the buttons previously on the screens
"BLD",1359,1,92,0)
 have been replaced by menu options at the top of the form.
"BLD",1359,1,93,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,94,0)
 2. Loop to Another Patient or Record
"BLD",1359,1,95,0)
 In both applications, a menu option (Get New Record) has been added to
"BLD",1359,1,96,0)
 allow the user to go to another record without exiting the application.
"BLD",1359,1,97,0)
 If accessing through CPRS, record selection is limited to the current
"BLD",1359,1,98,0)
 patient. From the Desktop application, users may select another patient
"BLD",1359,1,99,0)
 or go to another record for the same patient.
"BLD",1359,1,100,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,101,0)
 3. Comments
"BLD",1359,1,102,0)
 A comment box has been added to the Edit application where the clinician
"BLD",1359,1,103,0)
 can enter up to 300 characters of text. A checkbox has been inserted
"BLD",1359,1,104,0)
 directly above the comment area for use if the clinician would like to
"BLD",1359,1,105,0)
 automatically insert the words "NOT ADEQUATE FOR RATING PURPOSES". This
"BLD",1359,1,106,0)
 text will be saved to the file and will be imported into VA form 10-2364.
"BLD",1359,1,107,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,108,0)
 4. Update VA form 10-2364
"BLD",1359,1,109,0)
 VA form 10 2364 has been modified to reflect the changes made to the form
"BLD",1359,1,110,0)
 since the release of patch ACKQ*3.0*3. The comment section of the form is
"BLD",1359,1,111,0)
 no longer editable.
"BLD",1359,1,112,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,113,0)
 5. Color Changes
"BLD",1359,1,114,0)
 Color has been removed from the data entry boxes. This allows for a
"BLD",1359,1,115,0)
 cleaner presentation and makes more of the screen available for the edit
"BLD",1359,1,116,0)
 boxes.
"BLD",1359,1,117,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,118,0)
 6. Retransmit Audiogram
"BLD",1359,1,119,0)
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow
"BLD",1359,1,120,0)
 retransmission of a signed audiogram.  This is necessary to transfer the
"BLD",1359,1,121,0)
 speech, word and other readings that were not a part of the original
"BLD",1359,1,122,0)
 transmission.
"BLD",1359,1,123,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,124,0)
 7. Removing Audiogram
"BLD",1359,1,125,0)
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow deletion
"BLD",1359,1,126,0)
 of a signed audiogram. This became necessary because, in their haste to
"BLD",1359,1,127,0)
 enter audiograms under heavy workload pressures, users sometimes entered
"BLD",1359,1,128,0)
 audiograms under the wrong patient and the error was not discovered until
"BLD",1359,1,129,0)
 after transmission. This would then become a problem when data would be
"BLD",1359,1,130,0)
 on duplicate systems for the wrong patient. After installing this patch,
"BLD",1359,1,131,0)
 when a local signed audiogram is deleted, a message with identifying
"BLD",1359,1,132,0)
 information is sent to the DDC to delete the record there also.
"BLD",1359,1,133,0)
 Clinicians should use utmost caution in both entering and removing
"BLD",1359,1,134,0)
 audiograms.
"BLD",1359,1,135,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,136,0)
 8. File Changes
"BLD",1359,1,137,0)
 Numerous fields were added to the AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file to provide the
"BLD",1359,1,138,0)
 additional data needed for diagnostic and reporting purposes. The data
"BLD",1359,1,139,0)
 type of many fields was changed at the request of the national program
"BLD",1359,1,140,0)
 office to more efficiently handle the text and tags required in the
"BLD",1359,1,141,0)
 fields. Many that were numeric are now free text. Refer to the
"BLD",1359,1,142,0)
 CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO FILE section for more detailed information.
"BLD",1359,1,143,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,144,0)
 9. New Fields on Edit Pages
"BLD",1359,1,145,0)
 The new editable fields (bullet 8) and data type screening were added to
"BLD",1359,1,146,0)
 the Edit program.
"BLD",1359,1,147,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,148,0)
 10. Masking Change
"BLD",1359,1,149,0)
 Masking is no longer referenced in the fields with an '*', but will
"BLD",1359,1,150,0)
 instead be indicated by a non-zero numeric value in the 'Masking Level'
"BLD",1359,1,151,0)
 field. Prior instances of the data without a masking level will continue
"BLD",1359,1,152,0)
 to display the '*' sign.
"BLD",1359,1,153,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,154,0)
 11. No Response Change
"BLD",1359,1,155,0)
 The symbol for 'No Response'(+) will now be stored in the text field with
"BLD",1359,1,156,0)
 the numeric value.
"BLD",1359,1,157,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,158,0)
 12. No Testing, No Masking
"BLD",1359,1,159,0)
 'CNM', 'CNT', 'DNT' and 'FLAT; are now accommodated in the appropriate
"BLD",1359,1,160,0)
 text fields in the file as well as in the Edit program.
"BLD",1359,1,161,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,162,0)
 13. Transducer Type
"BLD",1359,1,163,0)
 Users can now indicate if testing was done via inserts or headphones.
"BLD",1359,1,164,0)
 This is also displayed on the 10-2364.
"BLD",1359,1,165,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,166,0)
 14. Eliminate Duplicate Presentation and Material
"BLD",1359,1,167,0)
 One selection of the Presentation Method and Material are now applicable
"BLD",1359,1,168,0)
 to all of the Word Recognition tests, via a single drop down list.
"BLD",1359,1,169,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,170,0)
 15. Tympanogram Type and Other Test
"BLD",1359,1,171,0)
 Tympanogram Type and 'Other Test' types have been added to the Acoustic
"BLD",1359,1,172,0)
 Immittance page.
"BLD",1359,1,173,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,174,0)
 16. Claim Number
"BLD",1359,1,175,0)
 The Claim Number has been added to the Edit form so that it can be
"BLD",1359,1,176,0)
 included on VA form 10-2364.
"BLD",1359,1,177,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,178,0)
 17. Maximum Value Change
"BLD",1359,1,179,0)
 Maximum values allowed have been updated and associated 'Hints' have been
"BLD",1359,1,180,0)
 adjusted.
"BLD",1359,1,181,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,182,0)
 18. Hints
"BLD",1359,1,183,0)
 It is now possible for the user to inactivate or reactivate the hint
"BLD",1359,1,184,0)
 feature.
"BLD",1359,1,185,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,186,0)
 19. Clinician Title
"BLD",1359,1,187,0)
 The title of the clinician and location will now show on the display.
"BLD",1359,1,188,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,189,0)
 20. Presentation Method
"BLD",1359,1,190,0)
 CD and Tape have been consolidated into a single Recorded type.
"BLD",1359,1,191,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,192,0)
 21. About Box
"BLD",1359,1,193,0)
 An 'About' box was added to the main forms to comply with VistA
"BLD",1359,1,194,0)
 convention.

 Installation of this patch will take about 5 minutes. Additional
"BLD",1359,1,265,0)
 time will be needed if the GUI applications have been installed on
"BLD",1359,1,266,0)
 individual client machines or the location of the applications on the
"BLD",1359,1,267,0)
 network has changed. Users need not be off the system when applying this
"BLD",1359,1,268,0)
 patch, but it should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
"BLD",1359,1,269,0)
 disruption to users.

"BLD",1359,1,295,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,296,0)
  7. Following the installation of the KIDS build, the system will
"BLD",1359,1,297,0)
     immediately run routine ACKQAG08. This will move any existing
"BLD",1359,1,298,0)
     'No Response' or 'Masked' tags into the appropriate threshold fields.
"BLD",1359,1,299,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,300,0)
  8. At this point the two revised executables (ACKQROES3.EXE and
"BLD",1359,1,301,0)
     ACKQROES3E.EXE) should be copied over all existing copies on the
"BLD",1359,1,302,0)
     network or client machine. Add the VistA menu options for any new
"BLD",1359,1,303,0)
     application users and setup on their CPRS Toolbar as necessary, as
"BLD",1359,1,304,0)
     detailed in the INSTALLATION GUIDE.
"BLD",1359,1,305,0)
 
"BLD",1359,1,306,0)
  9. We do not anticipate any need to reinstall this patch. However, it
"BLD",1359,1,307,0)
     may be reinstalled if necessary.

This patch addresses several issues that came up at the VAMC stations as
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
a result of the initial release of the Audiometric Exam Module (patch
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
ACKQ*3.0*3). These changes have been made to the GUI(Windows based)
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
Enter/Edit(ACKQROES3E.EXE) and Display(ACKQROES3.EXE) applications in the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
package for both the CPRS Toolbar and Desktop versions, as well as to the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
VistA part of the application. The VistA part includes the file data
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
dictionary, Remote Procedure Calls and routines.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
The Audiometric Exam Module was developed in conjunction with the Remote
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
Order Entry System (ROES 3.0) at the VA Denver Distribution Center(DDC)
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
and is only available to run in the Windows environment. The application
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
can be installed completely from this patch, if ACKQ*3.0*3 was not
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
installed. Users are encouraged to consult the full Installation Guide
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
referenced below if AKCQ*3.0*3 was not installed. If ACKQ*3.0*3 was 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
installed, then installing the KIDS build and copying the new executables 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
over the original executables of the same name will complete
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
the install.

 ----------------------------
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
 Problem: When a user without context accessed the Edit Module, they were
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
 allowed to enter the application and view the screens. They were not able
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
 to actually edit the data.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
 Solution: The application [ACKQROES3E.EXE] was modified to exit and halt
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
 the application if the user did not have the appropriate VistA
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)

 entering a new record and cancels out of entering the date and time of
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
 the exam.

"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
 Solution: A fix is applied in routine ACKQAG02 and in the record setup
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
 to give the appropriate error message and exit the application if a valid

 Problem: Some error messages or message prompts were coming up behind
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,56,0)
 other screens. The only way for them to show up was to select the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
 application from the bottom task bar.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
 Solution: Most of the messages in the Audiogram Edit application are now
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
 enclosed in code to send them to topmost position and after the message
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
 ends, to restore the previous topmost setup.  This may not be a complete
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,62,0)
 solution, but available documentation indicates it should help, if not
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,63,0)
 eliminate the problem from this application.

"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,73,0)
The Audiometric Exam Module provided new functionality for Audiology and
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,74,0)
Speech Pathology Services(ASPS), to simplify and enhance the entry,
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,75,0)
display and use of information obtained during the Audiometric exam of a
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,76,0)
patient. This module is comprised of two distinct application functions:
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,77,0)
        Audiogram Edit function [ACKQROES3E.EXE]
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,78,0)
        Audiogram Display function [ACKQROES3.EXE]
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,79,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,80,0)
Records are stored in the local AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file (^ACK(509850.9).
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,81,0)
When signed, the records are also transmitted from this global to the DDC
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,82,0)
through the VistA Mailman system. At the DDC, data from these records is
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,83,0)
included with orders for hearing aids and repairs when the orders are
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,84,0)
placed through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,85,0)
They may also be viewed remotely from the ROES Patient Information screen
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,86,0)
of the ROES web application.

"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,88,0)
ACKQ*3.0*12 implements the following changes:
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,89,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,90,0)
 1. Removal of Buttons
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,91,0)
 In both audiogram GUI applications, the buttons previously on the screens
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,92,0)
 have been replaced by menu options at the top of the form.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,93,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,94,0)
 2. Loop to Another Patient or Record
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,95,0)
 In both applications, a menu option (Get New Record) has been added to
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,96,0)
 allow the user to go to another record without exiting the application.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,97,0)
 If accessing through CPRS, record selection is limited to the current
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,98,0)
 patient. From the Desktop application, users may select another patient
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,99,0)
 or go to another record for the same patient.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,100,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,101,0)
 3. Comments
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,102,0)
 A comment box has been added to the Edit application where the clinician
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,103,0)
 can enter up to 300 characters of text. A checkbox has been inserted
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,104,0)
 directly above the comment area for use if the clinician would like to
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,105,0)
 automatically insert the words "NOT ADEQUATE FOR RATING PURPOSES". This
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,106,0)
 text will be saved to the file and will be imported into VA form 10-2364.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,107,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,108,0)
 4. Update VA form 10-2364
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,109,0)
 VA form 10 2364 has been modified to reflect the changes made to the form
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,110,0)
 since the release of patch ACKQ*3.0*3. The comment section of the form is
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,111,0)
 no longer editable.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,112,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,113,0)
 5. Color Changes
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,114,0)
 Color has been removed from the data entry boxes. This allows for a
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,115,0)
 cleaner presentation and makes more of the screen available for the edit
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,116,0)
 boxes.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,117,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,118,0)
 6. Retransmit Audiogram
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,119,0)
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,120,0)
 retransmission of a signed audiogram.  This is necessary to transfer the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,121,0)
 speech, word and other readings that were not a part of the original
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,122,0)

 7. Removing Audiogram
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,125,0)
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow deletion
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,126,0)
 of a signed audiogram. This became necessary because, in their haste to
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,127,0)
 enter audiograms under heavy workload pressures, users sometimes entered
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,128,0)
 audiograms under the wrong patient and the error was not discovered until
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,129,0)
 after transmission. This would then become a problem when data would be
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,130,0)
 on duplicate systems for the wrong patient. After installing this patch,
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,131,0)
 when a local signed audiogram is deleted, a message with identifying
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,132,0)
 information is sent to the DDC to delete the record there also.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,133,0)
 Clinicians should use utmost caution in both entering and removing
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,134,0)
 audiograms.

"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,136,0)
 8. File Changes
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,137,0)
 Numerous fields were added to the AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file to provide the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,138,0)
 additional data needed for diagnostic and reporting purposes. The data
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,139,0)
 type of many fields was changed at the request of the national program
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,140,0)
 office to more efficiently handle the text and tags required in the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,141,0)
 fields. Many that were numeric are now free text. Refer to the
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,142,0)
 CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO FILE section for more detailed information.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,143,0)

"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,146,0)
 the Edit program.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,147,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,148,0)
 10. Masking Change
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,149,0)
 Masking is no longer referenced in the fields with an '*', but will
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,150,0)
 instead be indicated by a non-zero numeric value in the 'Masking Level'
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,151,0)
 field. Prior instances of the data without a masking level will continue
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,152,0)
 to display the '*' sign.
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,153,0)
 
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,154,0)
 11. No Response Change
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,155,0)
 The symbol for 'No Response'(+) will now be stored in the text field with
"PKG",322,22,1,"PAH",1,1,156,0)
