 PRCA patch description for PRCA*4.5*201
  
 As per Directive 2001-023, this patch should be installed into the legacy 
 system unless they have not had any "active" or outstanding bills since 
 prior to FY 01 in the AR system.
  
 **PLEASE NOTE** This patch must be installed into the primary production 
 system before installing it into the legacy system(s).
  
 ************************** NOTE ************************************
 *CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation of this patch with the 
 *AR-CoreFLS development team.                                       
 ********************************************************************
  
 Associated Patch:  IB*2.0*233
  
 Interface Overview
 ------------------
 This document describes the design requirements for a software 
 development project where the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has 
 established a new set of revenue metrics for use in monitoring the 
 performance of the VHA revenue cycle at all VHA facilities.  The desired 
 metrics are industry-standard measures that are commonly used in other 
 public and private health care institutions.  VHA has an existing 
 centralized data warehouse that calculated these metrics and provides 
 results via a web-based performance metric site.  This data warehouse is 
 updated on a monthly basis.
  
 VHA's Chief Business Office (CBO) has identified the daily collection of 
 this data as a high priority to support the metrics development process.  
 CBO needs the daily collection of data to populate the centralized data 
 warehouse (database) with billing and collections transactions from each 
 VHA facility.  The calculated metrics would be viewable to field and 
 headquarters staff through an existing website.  An automated daily VistA 
 extract would provide more timely and accurate data to this centralized 
 data warehouse (database).
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 For the national implementation of this project, data will be triggered 
 by normal user processing into a data queue file.  This data will be 
 formatted and placed in a flat file via a nightly process.  This nightly 
 process has been added to PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS - Accounts Receivable 
 Nightly Process Background Job. This nightly process will take any 
 pending batches, format them and ftp them directly to the Boston 
 Allocation Resource Center (ARC).  This ftp process is an automated 
 version of the existing manual FTP method employed by the MCCF Monthly 
 Extract.  If the FTP process fails, a mail message will be sent to the 
 select Mail Group.  If the ARC fails to acknowledge receipt and 
 processing of the data files via an automated mail message, the nightly 
 batch will automatically resend any data not successfully transmitted in 
 previous attempts.
  
 As part of the post-installation process, multiple background jobs will 
 be created.  The first background job is all Active or Suspended bills. 
 The TaskMan description for this job will be CBO ACTIVE BILLS.  It will 
 be queued to start the evening of the installation at 8:00pm.  
  
 Additional jobs will be tasked for Fiscal Year 2004.  The description for 
 this job will be CBO FISCAL YR 2004 and will be queued to start the first 
 Saturday after installation at 6:00am.  Fiscal Year 2004 will be divided 
 by months since these extracts include AR Transactions.
  
 The number of monthly jobs created is dependent on the date of install.
  
 First task is for 9/26/2003-10/31/2003
 Second is for 11/1/2003-11/30/2003
 Third is for 12/1/2003-12/31/2003
 Fourth is for 1/1/2004-1/31/2004
 Fifth is for 2/1/2004-2/29/2004
 Sixth is for 3/1/2004-3/31/2004
 Seventh is for 4/1/2004-4/30/2004
 Eighth is for 5/1/2004-5/31/2004
 Ninth is for 6/1/2004-6/30/2004
 Tenth is for 7/1/2004-7/31/2004
 Eleventh is for 8/1/2004-8/31/2004
 Twelfth is for 9/1/2004-9/27/2004
  
  
 The next job will be for Fiscal Year 2003 and the description will be CBO 
 HISTORICAL EXTRACT FY03.  It will be queued to start the next Saturday 
 after the last CBO FISCAL YR 2004 task at 6:00 am.  The next job will be 
 for Fiscal Year 2002 and the description will be CBO HISTORICAL EXTRACT 
 FY02.  It will be queued to start the next Saturday after the CBO 
 HISTORICAL EXTRACT FY03 at 6:00 am.  The last job will be for Fiscal Year 
 2001 and the description will be CBO HISTORICAL EXTRACT FY01.  It will be 
 queued to start the next Saturday after the CBO HISTORICAL EXTRACT FY02 
 at 6:00am.
  
 NOTE:  If the scheduled time for these historical extracts are 
 inconvenient, they may be 'requeued' via the 'Requeue Tasks' option in 
 TaskMan.  The time frame chosen (Saturdays at 6:00am) was picked to 
 lessen impact on your VistA system.  
  
 **PLEASE NOTE**  A full fiscal year historical extract could take up to 
 25 hours to completely run and send data to the ARC depending on the 
 number of bills in your system.

 *****SPECIAL NOTES****
 **********************
  
 VMS DIRECTORY REQUIREMENTS
 -------------------------
 Discuss the need for a directory with all the appropriate privileges and 
 protections for files with the VMS system manager.  It must allow 'RWED' 
 for World in order to keep the directory cleaned up of already 
 transmitted files.  It might also be beneficial to turn off VMS 
 versioning control so that multiple versions of the same file are not 
 allowed.
  
 GLOBAL REQUIREMENT
 ------------------
 A new global is introduced in this patch, RCXV.  RCXV should be defined 
 with access privileges; RWD for System, World, Group and UCI, using 
 %GLOMAN for DSM and GPROTDEF for Cache.
  
 TEST ACCOUNTS
 -------------
 If this patch is installed in a test account, data will begin to be 
 accumulated and the historical extracts will be set up to run in the test 
 account's TaskMan and sent to the ARC.  The ability to turn this 
 functionality off ONLY in the test account has been provided.  It can be 
 turned off and on as needed for testing purposes.  Turning this 
 functionality off turns off both capture of data into the AR DATA QUEUE 
 File (#348.4) and the transmission of batches.  Batches created from a 
 test account are ftp'd to a separate account at the ARC.
  
 LEGACY SITES MAIL
 -----------------
 Since direct email may be disabled to legacy sites, ARC acknowledgement 
 messages must be forwarded from the primary site.  The primary domain 
 must be entered in order for server acknowledgements to be forwarded to 
 the legacy properly.

 Configuration Requirements
 --------------------------
 This project will use the FTP transfer protocol to transmit data from the 
 VISTA system.  A standard defined directory will be utilized at each 
 facility where the data files will be temporarily placed for the FTP 
 process.  These files will be deleted immediately after each file is 
 transmitted.  The maximum size for each batch file should not exceed 10 
 megabytes.  There are no long term space requirements due to the fact 
 that the files are deleted after each file is transmitted.
  
 Installation Notes
 ------------------
 This patch includes trigger points for two critical Accounts Receivable 
 files, #430 and #433.   It also includes the new AR DATA QUEUE file where 
 all daily entries will be triggered.
  
 Associated Patch IB*2.0*233 includes trigger points for the Bill/Claims 
 File #399.
  
 A new field has been added to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TRANS.TYPE File 
 (#430.3).  Field #5 CBO EXTRACT FLAG is a Set of Codes (1:Include;0:Do 
 not Include) which is used to indicate whether an AR record with that 
 transaction type should be triggered to the AR DATA QUEUE file.  The 
 addition of this new field should not affect program, PRCABJV, which 
 checks that this file has not been modified.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Installation of this patch is mandatory at all sites, including the 
 legacy systems if the legacy system still has "active" or outstanding 
 bills in AR.
  
 This patch should be installed after normal business hours, when all 
 Accounts Receivable Users are logged off the system.
 Ensure that the PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS is NOT running while installing 
 this patch.
  
 ****Installer should check prior to installation with the person who 
 maintains the Operating System configuration to decide on a directory 
 with the appropriate privileges.****
  
 During the install be prepared to answer the CBO AR DATA DIRECTORY with a 
 directory pathname where a data file can be placed and ftp'd from.
  
 For example - PRT$:[SPOOL] for VMS sites or C:\PATCHES\ for Cache sites.
  
 *NOTE:  For Cache sites, if the directory pathname contains a folder as 
 well as a drive, please include the ending '\'.*
  
 IMPORTANT:  This directory should have appropriate read, write, and 
 delete privileges (RWED,RWED,RWED,RWED).  For VMS sites to check the 
 directory protections go to upper directory and do a $DIR 
 NAME.DIR/owner/prot to see protections for the selected directory.
  
 Also, even though a new Mail group is sent in this installation, the IRM 
 can pick an existing Mail group instead.  This Mail Group will receive 
 FTP failure messages and should contain appropriate system level members.
  
 The installer will automatically be added as a member to mail group, 
 RCXVFTP.  The installer must have either the XMMGR or XM GROUP EDIT 
 MASTER security keys in order for this functionality to work.
  
 Install Time - less than 10 minutes in the foreground depending upon the 
 size of the Task file.  It is recommended that this install NOT be queued 
 but run in the foreground.
  
 This patch should not be installed during normal work hours as there are 
 too many options and their descendants that need to be disabled to 
 prevent possible conflicts for AR and IB users while running the KIDS 
 Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
