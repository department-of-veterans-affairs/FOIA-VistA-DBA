Description:
============

 The eClaims Plus project is a follow-on patch to the HIPAA EDI Claims 
 (Institutional & Professional) Enhancements (HECIPE) patch and the
 Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) patch. The acronym HIPAA
 stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
 1996. The acronym EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange.
  
 In order to complete the initial HECIPE project quickly, all requirements
 which were not considered absolutely necessary for HIPAA compliance were
 deferred with the plan to implement more requirements in subsequent
 patches. The initial HECIPE and MRA projects resulted in the electronic
 transmission of primary claims. Both the HECIPE and the MRA projects
 resulted in a need for changes to related Integrated Billing (IB) software
 to support IB personnel in their management of electronic claims. Over
 time, the addition of new payers who accept electronic claims has
 identified the need for IB personnel to have greater control over some of
 the data transmitted in electronic claims.
  
 The first iteration of the eClaims Plus project resulted in the ability 
 to send MRA secondary claims to a payer electronically.
  
 This patch is the second iteration of the eClaims Plus project and it 
 addresses enhancements to the IB software to support the electronic 
 claims process. It provides greater flexibility in the definition of 
 secondary IDs for different insurance companies and it increases the 
 usability of options used to manage electronic claims.
  
 List of Patch Items:
  
 1. The options, Resubmit a Batch of Bills [IBCE RESUBMIT BILL BATCH],
    Resubmit a Bill [IBCE RESUBMIT BILL], and View/Resubmit Claims as Test
    [IBCE PREV TRANSMITTED CLAIMS], have been replaced by a single option,
    View/Resubmit Claims - Live or Test [IBCE PREV TRANSMITTED CLAIMS],
    that allows a biller to resubmit bills as test or production bills.
  
 2. The option Claims Status Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS
    AWAITING] has been modified to included an enhanced display, the
    ability to re-sort the list and a new action that provides access to
    the new option Multiple CSA Message Management [IBCEMC MULT CSA MSG
    MANAGEMENT].
  
 3. Two new security keys have been added, IB EDI INSURANCE EDIT (locks 
    EDI fields in the Insurance Company Editor) and IB MESSAGE MANAGEMENT 
    (locks Multiple CSA Message Management). IRM should coordinate 
    assigning the new security keys with the MCCF Billing Supervisor.
  
 4. The option, Insurance Company Entry/Edit [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT], has
    been enhanced to include the following:
  
    a. A new action, Associate Companies (AC), which provides the ability
       to link insurance companies together in a parent/child relationship
       which gives the child the same Additional Billing Provider Secondary
       IDs and Physician/Provider Secondary IDs as those defined for the
       parent; 
  
    b. Changes to the action, Prov IDs/ID Params (ID), which provide the 
       ability to define Additional Billing Provider Secondary IDs, VA 
       Laboratory or Facility Secondary IDs and new ID Parameters;
  
    c. Changes to the definition of Billing Provider Secondary IDs to allow
       greater flexibility - different ID Qualifiers, IDs by Care Unit;
  
    d. Changes to the Insurance Company Editor display to include display
       of IDs, Parent/Child associations and ID Parameters.
  
 5. The ability to define default Billing Provider Secondary IDs through 
    the option, MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS]
    and Provider ID Maintenance [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT], has been removed.
  
 6. The option, Provider ID Maintenance [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT], has been
    modified in the following ways:
  
    a. Action #3, Facility IDs has been removed;
  
    b. Action #4, Care Unit Maintenance, has been expanded to include the 
       definition of care units for Billing Provider Secondary IDs;
  
    c. Action #6, NON/OTHER VA PROVIDER ID INFORMATION, has been enhanced
       to allow for the definition of Mammography Certification Numbers;
  
    d. Actions #1 (PROVIDER SPECIFIC IDS), #2 (Insurance CO IDs), #5 (INS
       CO BATCH ID ENTRY), and #6 (NON/OTHER VA PROVIDER ID INFORMATION)
       have been modified to prevent the editing of IDs for insurance
       companies that are defined as child companies.
  
 7. The options, Patient Billing Inquiry [IB OUTPUT FULL INQ BY BILL NO]
    and Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY], were
    enhanced to display a history of claims that were cancelled and copied
    to create a new bill.
  
 8. The option, Test Claim EDI Transmission Report [IBCE VIEW PREV TRANS 
    MESSAGE], was enhanced to provide the ability to search for claims in a
    date range.
  
 9. The option, Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO], has
    been enhanced to include the following:
  
    a. The ability to include a predefined Billing Provider Secondary ID 
       based upon a division and care unit;
  
    b. Enhancements to the on demand (?ID) display of IDs that will be 
       transmitted with the claim;
  
    c. Changes to automatically include the predefined VA or Non-VA
       Laboratory or Facility Secondary IDs on the claim;
  
    d. Changes to automatically include a predefined CLIA# from the 
       Institution file (#4) on claims for the Service Type = Lab;
  
    e. Changes to display the predefined VA and Non-VA Mammography 
       Certification Numbers from the Institution file (VA) or Provider ID 
       Maintenance (Non-VA) on claims for Service Type = Rad. The user must
       still enter the number.
  
 10. The extraction of data and the format of the 837 Claims Transmission 
     were modified to accommodate the changes to and addition of claims
     data for transmission.
  
 11. The local printing of a professional claim on a HCFA 1500 form was 
     modified to print the Mammography Certification Number in Box 32 when 
     present on a claim.
  
 12. The IB Electronic Report Disposition file (#361.2) was modified to
     include the R0S2 report.
  
 13. The new option, Multiple CSA Message Management [IBCEMC MULT CSA MSG
     MANAGEMENT], was created. This option provides the ability for a
     biller to perform CSA actions on multiple CSA messages at one time.  
     This option as designed for use in removing erroneous CSA messages
     quickly.  This option is locked.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Both the pre-installation routine and the post-installation routine 
 are automatically deleted after this patch is installed.
  
 The pre-installation routine will remove any locally created output 
 formatter overrides for the transmitted form type (Type="T" in the option 
 Forms Output Utility [IBCE OUTPUT FORMATTER]). Only those fields which
 override the nationally distributed fields released by this patch will be
 deleted. A MailMan message containing the deleted output formatter 
 overrides will be generated and sent to members of the IB EDI SUPERVISOR 
 mail group, as well as the patch installer. Message subject is as follows:
  
 Subj: Removal of  local output formatter overrides (IB*2*320)
  
  
 The pre-installation routine also generates and sends a MailMan message 
 containing the existing billing provider secondary IDs. The storage and 
 maintenance of these IDs is being changed with this patch. The message 
 is sent to members of the IB EDI SUPERVISOR mail group, as well as the 
 patch installer. Message subject is as follows:
  
 Subj: Legacy Billing Provider Secondary IDs and ID Types (IB*2*320)
  
  
 During the patch installation, x-ref  routines (IBXX*) and input template 
 routines (IBXSC*) for the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) will automatically be 
 compiled.

      is running.
  
 Also, make sure the auto-transmit of electronic claims option (Queue Auto 
 Transmit EDI Bills [IBCE 837 AUTO TRANSMIT]) in TaskManager is not 
 scheduled to run while the patch is being installed. It's best to check 
 with your Billing section on this. There is a field called HOURS TO 
 TRANSMIT BILLS (#8.06) in the IB Site Parameter file (#350.9) that may 
 contain specific times to transmit bills. If there are no specific times 
 set up in this parameter, claims will be transmitted when the Queue Means 
 Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP] job runs.
