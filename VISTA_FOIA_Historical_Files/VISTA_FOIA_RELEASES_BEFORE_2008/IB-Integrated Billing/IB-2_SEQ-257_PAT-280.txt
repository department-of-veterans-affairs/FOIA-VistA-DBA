 **************************** IMPORTANT NOTE *****************************
 This patch MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after installing patch 
 IB*2.0*232.  Failure to do so may cause data problems with E_claims that
 will bring the wrath of the clearinghouse down on you.
 *************************************************************************
  
 Associated patches: (v)IB*2.0*263   <<= must be installed BEFORE
                                         `IB*2.0*280'
                     (v)IB*2.0*240   <<= must be installed BEFORE
                                         `IB*2.0*280' 
                     (v)IB*2.0*232   <<= must be installed BEFORE
                                         `IB*2.0*280' 
  
 This patch will correct problems discovered very late in the testing
 of patch IB*2.0*232 (EDI Enhancements).
  
    1. Some users were not able to add care units to the IB PROVIDER ID 
       CARE UNIT file (#355.95).
       This was because a variable allowing the addition of the record
       (DLAYGO) was not set.  This has been added to the code and the
       problem was corrected.
       Routine affected: IBCEP4A
  
    2. The correct secondary provider id was not being pulled for pharmacy
       claims when the pharmacy id was assigned to a care unit AND another
       id was set up with the following characteristics for the same
       provider/insurance company:
       - it was assigned to the same form type as the pharmacy id
       - it was assigned to either an INPATIENT, an OUTPATIENT or both care
         types (the pharmacy id would be an 'RX' care type)
       - it had a care unit assigned to it also
       The code was changed to pull the correct pharmacy secondary provider
       id onto a pharmacy claim.
  
      Note the check sum for routine IBCEP3 will remain unchanged after 
      the patch is installed because only comments were changed in that
      routine. Routines affected: IBCEP2, IBCEP3
  
    3. Output Formatter changes have been made for the transmitted bill
       form.  These changes are made in the pre-installation routine
       IBY280PR.
       - Two entries in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT file (#364.7) are being
         deleted as they were moved by patch 232 and the old data was not
         removed.  The entry #'s deleted from this file are 158 and 210. 
         In addition, entry #390 was sent to replace entry #158.
       - The entry for the billing facility provider id has been changed to
         allow the site to use the output formatter override on this data
         for the transmission form.  The data is output in the CI1-7 
         record in the 837 IB TRANSMISSION form and the change was made in
         entry #1316 in the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION file (#364.6).
       - The transmission fields for the institutional data for Form
         Locator 56 will no longer allow any data to be transmitted.  The
         entry #'s changed in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT file (#364.7) are
         906, 907, 908, 909, 910.
          
    4. A problem has been found when storing electronic explanation of
       benefits (EEOBs) where multiple line item remark codes are being
       sent by the payers.  Up until this point, all but the last one was
       discarded. This patch allows for all of the remark codes to be
       stored.  The post-installation will move all existing data 
       in the LINE ITEM REMARK CODE field (#3.01) and the LINE ITEM REMARK
       CODE TEXT field (#3.02) of the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS file
       (#361.1), 835 LINE LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS SUB-FIELD (#361.115) to a new
       multiple field so the data in the existing electronic explanation of
       benefits (EEOBs) is not lost.  Once moved, the old LINE ITEM 
       REMARK CODE data is deleted.  Routines affected: IBCEOB0, IBCECSA5,
       IBY280PO
  
    5. A new edit has been added to the billing authorization edits that
       prevents an insurance bill from being authorized if the COB payer
       sequence is not one of the following: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, TERTIARY. 
       A new error entry for IB324 has been added to the IB ERROR file
       (#350.8) to report the error.  Routine affected: IBCBB1
  
    6. A few of the TRICARE intermediaries are requiring the sites to
       send a network id as a performing provider secondary id.  This
       id must be the provider's SSN, but must still be identified as a
       network ID on the electronically submitted claims.  Since this data
       already exists in VistA and it would be a huge burden on sites to
       enter this data a second time as a network ID, the system will
       automatically output the provider's SSN qualified as a network ID if
       the following two conditions are true:
          1) The insurance company's ELECTRONIC PLAN TYPE field (#.15) in 
             the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN file (#355.3) is identified as a
             TRICARE insurance.
          2) There is no other network ID defined for the insurance
             company/provider combination.
  
    7.  When patch IB*2.0*240 was installed, it changed the EDI code to
        identify CHAMPUS/TRICARE insurance from CH to TR.  This caused all
        electronic TRICARE claims to be rejected.  This patch returns the
        EDI code for TRICARE (CHAMPUS) back to CH in the ELECTRONIC PLAN
        TYPE field (#.15) in the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN file (#355.3) and
        changes any 'TR' data in that field in the entries in the file
        back to 'CH'.
  
    8. The pre-install also corrects several data-related problems
       introduced by the original EDI Enhancements patch IB*2.0*232.
       a.  All provider id types in the file (#355.97) have been updated
           with the correct X12 codes.
       b.  A trigger cross reference (#1) on the field now called 
           DELETE 2006 4.1 (#4.1) in the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) is
           deleted. This cross reference triggered a field that no longer
           exists (ALTERNATE PERF PROV ID SOURCE).
       c. In the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36), if this is the first time
          patch IB*2*280 has been installed at the site, the data for the
          parameters for PERFORMING PROVIDER SECONDARY ID TYPE (UB) (field
          #4.02) and for PERFORMING PROVIDER SECONDARY ID TYPE (HCFA)
          (field #4.01) is deleted.
       d. In patch IB*2.0*232, the remote mail group member for mail group
          MCR was removed mistakenly.  This patch puts it back in to
          prevent loss of receipt of status messages at the site for claims
          that were sent before the patch 232 installation.
