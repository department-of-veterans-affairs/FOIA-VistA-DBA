Subject: EXTENSIBLE EDITOR - ELIMINATION OF PACKAGE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

  Installation of patch RGED*2.6*1 is OPTIONAL.
   
  Extensible Editor 2.6 was initially released to support
  functionality within Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
  (MPI/PD) 1.0.  The dependencies by MPI/PD on the Extensible Editor
  product have been  eliminated.  All formal integration agreements
  have been retired.  Extensible Editor 2.6 is no longer supported
  nationally, making it Class II software.  If you choose to do so,
  you can install patch RGED*2.6*1 to remove the Extensible Editor
  package from VistA.  This is a local decision, and the installation
  of this patch is OPTIONAL.
   
  It is STRONGLY recommended that all facilities install this patch.
  The Extensible Editor application contains a global that has embedded
  control characters.  This violates the VA Standards and Conventions
  (SAC) and it is also in violation of the current ANSI MDC X11.1
  Portability Standards.
   
  The Extensible Editor package consists of files, dialogs, help
  frames, routines and an option in the RGED* namespace.  Please 
  follow all steps listed below to remove this application.
   
  Help Frames:
  ============
  A total of 112 help frames with the "RGED" namespace are deleted
  by this patch.  These help frames are sent as DELETE AT SITE.
   
  Option:
  =======
  The Purge Terminated User Settings [RGED PURGE] option is
  deleted by this patch.  This option is sent as DELETE AT SITE.
   
  Routine Summary:
  ================
  The following is a list of the routine(s) included in this patch.
  The second line of each of these routine(s) will look like:

  Manchester, NH
  Montana HCS

  Tennessee Valley HCS
   
  NOTE: Step #1 through Step #7 should be followed for complete
  elimination of the Extensible Editor.
   
  Step #1 Determine Usage:
  ========================
  To determine if you should install this patch, find out if anyone
  at your facility is using the XTENSIBLE EDITOR as their preferred
  editor.  Use VA FileMan to conduct the search listed below.
   
  VA FileMan 22.0
  Select OPTION: SEARCH FILE ENTRIES<RET>
                 ------------------------
  OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: NEW PERSON<RET>
                         ---------------
   -A- SEARCH FOR NEW PERSON FIELD: PREFERRED EDITOR<RET>
                                    ---------------------
   -A- CONDITION: EQUALS<RET>
                  -----------
   -A- EQUALS ALTERNATE EDITOR: XTENSIBLE EDITOR<RET>
                                ----------------------
   
   -B- SEARCH FOR NEW PERSON FIELD: <RET>
                                    -----
   
  IF: A<RET>    PREFERRED EDITOR EQUALS (XTENSIBLE EDITOR)
      ------
   
  STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: <RET>
                                       -----
   
  SORT BY: NAME// <RET>
                  -----
  START WITH NAME: FIRST// <RET>
                           -----
  FIRST PRINT FIELD: NAME<RET>
                     ---------
  THEN PRINT FIELD: PREFERRED EDITOR<RET>
                    ---------------------
  THEN PRINT FIELD: <RET>
                    -----
  Heading (S/C): NEW PERSON SEARCH// <RET>
                                     -----
  DEVICE: <Queue or print this report if you think it might be lengthy.>
   
   
  Step #2 Change Preferred Editor:
  ================================
  If individuals at your facility are using the XTENSIBLE EDITOR
  as their preferred editor, a decision must be reached.  If the
  Extensible Editor package is to be eliminated, then the preferred
  editor for the identified individuals must be changed.  If the
  consensus at your facility is that the Extensible Editor is useful
  to your users, then you should NOT install patch RGED*2.6*1.
  Keep in mind however that this Class II software is no longer
  nationally supported.
   
  If you choose to proceed, use VA FileMan to edit the PREFERRED EDITOR
  (#31.3) field in the NEW PERSON (#200) file as listed below.  You can
  change the preferred editor to one agreed upon at your facility.
  Alternately, you can enter the "@" to remove the current editor and
  leave the field blank.  If this field is blank, then the default
  editor will be either the FileMan screen editor when editing within
  ScreenMan format, or the standard FileMan line editor in all other
  cases.
   
  VA FileMan 22.0
  Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES<RET>
                 -------------------------------
   
  INPUT TO WHAT FILE: NEW PERSON<RET>
                      ---------------
  EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// PREFERRED EDITOR<RET>
                          ---------------------
  THEN EDIT FIELD: <RET>
                   -----
   
  Select NEW PERSON NAME: <Enter a name from the report in Step #1.>
  PREFERRED EDITOR: XTENSIBLE EDITOR// <Change OR delete.>
   
  Repeat this process until all individuals on the report are updated.
   
   
  Step #3 Eliminate Entry:
  ========================
  Repeat Step #1 to confirm that no one has the XTENSIBLE EDITOR as their
  preferred editor.  Use the following process to eliminate the XTENSIBLE
  EDITOR entry in the ALTERNATE EDITOR (#1.2) file.
   
  VA FileMan 22.0
  Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES<RET>
                 -------------------------------
   
  INPUT TO WHAT FILE: ALTERNATE EDITOR<RET>
                      ---------------------
  EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <RET>
                          -----
   
  Select ALTERNATE EDITOR: XTENSIBLE EDITOR<RET>
                           ---------------------
  NAME: XTENSIBLE EDITOR// @<RET>
                           ------
    SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'XTENSIBLE EDITOR'
    ALTERNATE EDITOR? YES<RET>  (Yes)
                      --------
  SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN 'POINTED TO'
  BY ENTRIES IN THE 'NEW PERSON' FILE,
  DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD TAKE
  QUITE A WHILE)? No// <Answer as you choose.  If you answer NO, pointers
                        are not updated.  If you answer YES, you can delete
                        pointers or change them to a different entry.  If
                        you have just completed step #1 and step #2, we
                        suggest you answer NO.>
   
   
  Step #4 Install Patch:
  ======================
  If you choose to eliminate the Extensible Editor version 2.6 help
  frames, option and routines follow the instructions listed below.
       
  NOTE: Prior to installation, you should ensure that the Purge
  Terminated User Settings [RGED PURGE] option is not tasked to run. 
  Use the Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] on the Taskman
  Management [XUTM MGR] menu to unscheduled this task.
       
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 5 minutes.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed above 
      are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this
      time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RGED*2.6*1).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RGED*2.6*1.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//', respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
   
  Step #5 Files and Dialogs:
  ==========================
  The following is a list of the Extensible Editor files.
      996     EXTENSIBLE EDITOR                 Global ^RGED1(
      996.2   EXTENSIBLE EDITOR SPELL CHECKER   Global ^RGED3(
      996.1   Global ^RGED(      file is not VA FileMan compatible.
   
  As these are unsubscripted globals, they cannot be deleted in
  a KIDS post-install.  Make sure that the system on which you
  plan to do the deletion does not restrict the killing of these
  unsubscripted globals.  Use the following procedure.
   
  In DSM use %GLOMAN to set user protection on the globals
  RGED, RGED1 and RGED3 to "RWP".  In OpenM (Cache), to enable
  unsubscripted global kills, type in the command S X=$ZU(68,28,0).
     
  In programmer mode, run routine RGEDPST to delete the files,
  data dictionaries and data for 996 and 996.2 and the file and
  data for 996.1.  The routine also removes DIALOG entries 9960001
  through 9960070 in the DIALOG (#.84) file.  These entries were
  distributed by the Extensible Editor.
   
      *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****
   
  >D ^RGEDPST
     
  Before running this routine, you must set protection to
  allow deletion of the unsubscripted globals as directed.
   
  Are you sure you want to continue? NO// YES
   
  Deleting file 996.
  Deleting file 996.2.
  Deleting file 996.1.
  Extensible Editor files have been deleted.
   
  Deleting Extensible Editor dialog entries.
  ......................................................................
   
  DIALOG entries 9960001 through 9960070 have been deleted.
   
      *****     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****
   
  In OpenM, to disable unsubscripted global kills, type in the command
  S X=$ZU(68,28,1) or halt out of the process and create a new process
  before continuing.
   
   
  Step #6 Package File:
  =====================
  The Extensible Editor package entry may be deleted from
  the local PACKAGE (#9.4) file using VA FileMan as listed below.
   
  VA FileMan 22.0
  Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES<RET>
                 -------------------------------
   
  INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PACKAGE<RET>
                      ------------
  EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// <RET>
                          -----
   
  Select PACKAGE NAME: EXTENSIBLE EDITOR<RET>       RGED
                       ----------------------
  NAME: EXTENSIBLE EDITOR// @<RET>
                            ------
    SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'EXTENSIBLE EDITOR' PACKAGE?
    YES<RET>
    --------
  SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN 'POINTED TO'
  BY ENTRIES IN THE 'DIALOG' FILE, ETC.,
  DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD TAKE QUITE A WHILE)? No//
  <Answer as you choose.>
