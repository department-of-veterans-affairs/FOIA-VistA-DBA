Subject: TEAM CLOSED NOT WORKING IN LIST MANAGER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix a functionality problem that exists when assigning a 
 patient to a closed PCMM Team via Appointment Management.  The user is 
 allowed to assign the patient without receiving any warning message that 
 the team has been closed.  This warning message is properly displayed 
 when doing the assignment using the PCMM GUI functionality and the 
 functionality in Appointment Management should mirror the GUI 
 functionality.

 NOIS/REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ============================
 HD63115 (NWI-0500-41451) - TEAM CLOSED NOT WORKING IN LIST MANAGER
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user attempts to assign a patient to a closed PCMM Team via the
    PCMM GUI, they are presented with a warning message that the selected
    team has been closed and asked if they still want to assign the
    patient.  However, when a user attempts to assign a patient to a
    closed PCMM Team using Appointment Management, they are not presented 
    with any kind of warning and are allowed to proceed with the assignment.
    Although the user should have the option to still assign the patient
    to a closed PCMM Team, they should first be presented with the warning
    message like they are via the PCMM GUI logic.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    New logic has been added to routine SCMCQK1, which will present the
    user with a warning message, when applicable, that the selected PCMM
    Team has been closed.  They will also be asked if they still want to
    continue with the team assignment.  This will now function as it
    does in the PCMM GUI.
