Subject: Fix Copay Test Transmission

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Non Service Connected Veterans, who are in an Enrollment Priority Group 5 
 or Group 6, do not require a Means Test but they are required to have an 
 Rx Copay Test.  Currently the Full Data HL7 Transmission (ORU/ORF~Z07) 
 from VistA to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) is not including the 
 test.
  
 The Full Data HL7 Transmission is only sending the Rx Copay Test to the 
 HEC when the test is linked to a valid Means Test. This link is 
 identified when the LINKED RX COPAY/MEANS TEST field (#2.06) of the 
 ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (408.31) in the Means Test contains a pointer to 
 the Rx Copay Test and vice versa.
  
 This patch (IVM*2.0*116) is correctly identifying Priority Group 5 and 6 
 veterans who only require an Rx Copay Test, and those tests will be 
 included in the Full Data HL7 Transmission.
