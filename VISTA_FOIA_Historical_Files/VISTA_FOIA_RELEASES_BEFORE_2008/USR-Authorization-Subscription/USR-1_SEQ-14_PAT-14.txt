Subject: AUTHORIZED/SUBSCRIPTION - CORRECT UNDEFINED VARIABLE USRCHNG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch will correct the problem of a undefined variable, "USRCHNG", when 
 removing users from their current Authorized/Subscription role.  The problem 
 is caused by a invalid reference to a field in the file 
 "USER CLASS MEMBERSHIP(8930.3)".  If a invalid reference is detected an error 
 message will be generated and emailed to the clinician who is removing the 
 individual from their current role.  The email message will show the 
 individuals name and the invalid reference.  The email message will contain 
 instructions for the user and IRM personnel.
  
 This patch will include a Post Install routine that will check the file
 references (AUC & ACU) in "USER CLASS MEMBERSHIP(8930.3)", for any missing 
 pointers. If a invalid file reference is found the entry in the cross 
 reference will be removed.
