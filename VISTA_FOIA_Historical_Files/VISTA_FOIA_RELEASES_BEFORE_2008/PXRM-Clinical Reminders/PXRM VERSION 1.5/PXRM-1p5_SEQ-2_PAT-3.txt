Subject: Reminder Expanded Taxonomy Delete

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch must be loaded if the DRG Grouper Version 18.0 
 software has already been loaded. If the DRG Grouper Version 18.0 
 software has not yet been loaded then this patch should be loaded 
 IMMEDIATELY after the DRG Grouper globals have been loaded. 
    
 There is a possibility that the EXPANDED TAXONOMIES file (#811.3) could
 have been rebuilt incorrectly during the install of the DRG Grouper
 Version 18.0 software. The install of the ICD package deleted the globals
 for ICD Operation/Procedure (#80) and ICD Diagnosis (#80.1) and if a
 reminder evaluation for a taxonomy was performed at that time the EXPANDED
 TAXONOMY list for that taxonomy would be rebuilt with no codes or with an
 incomplete set.
    
 The impact of this is that reminders that include the taxonomy as a
 finding item will not evaluate correctly.
    
 The EXPANDED TAXONOMIES file is rebuilt whenever a taxonomy is edited or one
 of the source files has changed since the expansion was last done. The source
 files are ICD0, ICD9, and ICPT.
    
 The post install routine in this patch will delete the entries in the EXPANDED
 TAXONOMIES file (811.3).  The entries in the EXPANDED TAXONOMIES file
 will be added as reminders using the codes are evaluated, either through 
 the use of health summaries or on the CPRS coversheet.
