Description: 
============

  Note: This patch should only be installed at sites running CPRS.
   
   This patch includes routines, protocols, options, and data
   dictionary updates.
   
  FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
  ========================
   
  Printing:
  1) This patch introduces the printing of TIU results.
  2) Multiple results including addenda to Consult results will be printed.
  3) Added Requester Title, Room Bed, ward, Date plus time of request,
     Primary Care provider, team, enhanced page numbering, patient address
     info on first page footer and pager/phone number of requester.
  4) Cosignature information will be printed for TIU results and their
     addenda.
  5) When a consult is discontinued through CPRS or the Consults package,
     the SF-513 will be reprinted to the receiving service indicating that
     the request is cancelled.
  6) All additional signers of Consult results will print on the SF-513.
   
  Actions:
  1) The receive action is corrected to disallow receiving a consult
     multiple times or receiving a consult that is not in a pending status.
  2) The administrative complete actions are introduced. This allows a
     consult to be completed without attaching a TIU note.
  3) New logic for significant findings to allow administrative users to
     indicate unknown.
  4) Added logic to allow edit/resubmit of cancelled consults from
     notifications in the CPRS GUI.
  5) Corrected problems with the edit/resubmit logic for cancelled consults
     in the CPRS List Manager interface. 
  6) The Change View action in GMRC SERVICE TRACKING has been enhanced to
     allow easier choice of statuses to sort by.
  7) Corrected the display of Consult and Procedure requests through CPRS
     to properly identify entries as Consults or Procedures.
   
   
  Notifications:
  1) Correction to alert processing to delete according to CPRS
     Notification Mgmt parameters.
  
   
   
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  
  1) CONSULTATION REQUEST (#123) file
  
     a) A new field #.1, DISPLAY TEXT OF ITEM ORDERED has been added. This
        field stores the type of consult requested for a particular
        request.
     b) A new cross-reference has been added to field #2, FROM. The "H"
        cross-reference allows tracking of requested consults by the
        location that sent the consult.
     c) A new cross-reference has been added to field #10, SENDING
        PROVIDER. The "G" cross-reference allows lookup of entries by
        sending provider.
     d) A new multiple field #50, ASSOCIATED RESULTS has been added. This
        multiple field contains one sub-field: #.01 ASSOCIATED RESULTS.
        This field is defined as a variable pointer but currently only
        stores entries from the TIU DOCUMENT (#8925) file. This field is
        indexed by a whole file cross-reference. The "R" cross-reference
        allows lookup of a consult request by its associated result.
     e) Two New sub-fields have been added to field # 40, REQUEST
        PROCESSING ACTIVITY. Sub-field #9, RESULT records a TIU document if
        the activity is a completion action. Sub-field #10 ACTION METHOD is
        used to record the method used to perform the activity.
  
  
   2) REQUEST ACTION TYPES (#123.1) file
  
     a) Field #2, RELATED ACTION PROTOCOL is deleted with this patch.
     b) Field #99, INSTALL PROTOCOL FOR FIELD 2 is deleted with this patch.
     c) A new field, #7 ACTION PRINT NAME has been added. This field is
        used on the SF-513 form as a header for comments.
     d) Data entries are exported for file #123.1. The following new
        entries will be added:
         SIG FINDING UPDATE  
         COMPLETE/UPDATE  
         DISASSOCIATE RESULT  
         ADDENDUM ADDED TO  
         NEW NOTE ADDED  
  
   
   3) REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file:
  
     a) The .01 field NAME has been changed to SERVICE NAME. 
     b) A new multiple field, #101 PROCEDURE TYPE has been added. This
        field is used to record the procedures that can be performed by a
        particular consulting service. This field has one sub-field: .01
        which is a pointer to the PROTOCOL (#101) file. This .01 field is
        indexed by the "APR" cross-reference which lists the procedures
        that can be performed a by a service.
     c) The name of field #123.5, SERVICE PURGING INDIVIDUAL has been
        changed. The new name is SPECIAL UPDATES INDIVIDUAL. This
        field contains an individual from the NEW PERSON file that can
        perform group status updates for a given consulting service.
     d) A new multiple field, #123.33 ADMINISTRATIVE USERS W/O NOTIF Has
        been added. This multiple field is used to list those users that
        may complete consult or procedure requests without associating a
        TIU document. This field contains one sub-field. The .01 sub-field
        is a pointer to the NEW PERSON file.
  
  
  Options included:
  1) GMRC MGR
  2) GMRC PRINT TEST PAGE  - this is a new option. It allows a user to
     select a printer for reviewing print parameters. A report is generated
     which includes the current device print parameters and a ruler to
     verify the length of the current print page. A description of how to
     use the ruler is included in the report.  It is useful for assuring
     printer definitions are defined correctly.
  
   
             
   
  Protocol menus included:
  1) GMRCACTM CHANGE VIEW
  2) GMRCACTM DISPLAY ACTIONS
  3) GMRCACTM HIDDEN ACTIONS
  4) GMRCACTM SERVICE ACTION MENU
  5) GMRCACTM USER REVIEW SCREEN
   
  All of the actions that were under these menus are redistributed in
  this patch. The exit, entry, and header logic has been standardized
  across the actions.
   
   
  The functionality of the following protocols has been changed: 
  1) GMRCACT COMPLETE - Changed print name to Complete/Update
  2) GMRCACT PRINT CONSULT FORM - Changed to call new print 513 logic
  3) GMRCACT SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS - Adds new action "Sig Finding" 
              
   
  List Templates Included:
  1) GMRC DETAILED DISPLAY
  2) GMRC RESULTS DISPLAY
  3) GMRC CONSULT TRACKING
  4) GMRC ALERT ACTION

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded as soon as possible after CPRS V1 has
  been successfully loaded.  It should be run before letting users back on
  the system after the CPRS V1 install. The installation will take about 5
  minutes.  The post-init will queue a job that will move the TIU NARRATIVE
  RESULT into the ASSOCIATED RESULTS narrative.  Users need not be off-line
  until the queued job is finished.  The post-install job that is 
  processing will do "on-the-fly" conversions as needed.
   
  1. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  2. Use the Load a Distribution option. When prompted for a Host File:
  
       Enter a Host File: GMRC3_P4.KID
   
  3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRC*3.0*4
   
  4. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//", respond YES. When prompted to select the options
     you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
       OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN            CPRS Clinician Menu
       OR OE/RR MENU NURSE                CPRS Nurse Menu
       OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK           CPRS Ward Clerk Menu
       GMRC MGR                           Consult Management
       GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES        Set up Consult Services
       GMRC GENERAL SERVICE USER          Consult Service Tracking
      
     During the time routines and protocols are being installed, no
     updates should be done to consults from CPRS or the Consults package.
  
  5. Installation should take less than five minutes.
  
  
  POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ================================
  1. The pre-install routine GMRCYP4 may be deleted following successful
     installation of GMRC*3*4.
