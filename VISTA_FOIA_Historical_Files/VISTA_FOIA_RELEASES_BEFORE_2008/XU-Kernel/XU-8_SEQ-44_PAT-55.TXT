Subject: Re-issue of E-Sig Improvements

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  This is a reissue of Patch XU*8*14 without the code that requires the
  users to change their E-SIG every 90 days.   You may install this patch
  whether or not you previously installed XU*8*14.  (Sites who installed
  XU*8*14 prior to it being marked 'Entered in Error' were advised that they
  need not de-install the patch.)
   
  The new E-SIG functions allow developers to follow the General Counsel's
  guidelines on E-SIG.  The guidelines are the result of a meeting held in
  Birmingham on 9/18-20/95.  A new routine, XUSESIG1, is included in this
  patch.
   
  Changes to the New Person file:
   Added a DEGREE field to hold MD, RN, LPN...
   Added a DATE E-SIG LAST CHANGED field. This field is just for on-line 
   documentation purposes.  Sites may use this field for local reporting 
   and management, but the Kernel does NOT perform any action aside 
   from updating the field when the E-sig is changed by the user.
   
  The option XUSESIG BLOCK is included in this patch.
  The forms XUEXISTING USER, XUREACT USER, and XUNEW USER are included in
  the patch.  The new field DEGREE has been added to the Forms.
    
  KERNEL functions to help developers.
   
  $$CHKSUM^XUSESIG1($name_value,flag)
  This EXTRINSIC FUNCTION will take a root ($name_value) and build a
  checksum for all data in the root. (Not used now, flag would be used when
  there is more than one checksum algorithm.) 
   
  $$ESBLOCK^XUSESIG1(ien)
  This extrinsic function will return the set of fields from the new 
  person file that are needed as part of the hash for an acceptable E-Sig. 
  If IEN is not passed in, then DUZ is used.
  (E-Sig block, E-Sig title, Degree, Current Date/Time)
   
  $$EN^XUSESIG1(checksum,esblock)
  If the ESBLOCK is not passed then the function would get the ESBLOCK. In 
  either case this extrinsic function would encode the ESBLOCK using the 
  checksum as the KEY.  Returns an encoded string.  
   
  $$CMP^XUSESIG1(checksum,$name_value)
  This extrinsic function will compare the checksum passed in to the 
  calculated value from the $NAME_VALUE.  Return 1 for match, 0 for no 
  match.
   
  $$DE^XUSESIG1(checksum,encoded_string)
  This extrinsic function would decode the string using the checksum as 
  the key.  Return a decoded string.

  ========================================================================= 
  Installation:
   
  1.  Some of these routines are usually mapped on systems that allow
  mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
   
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
  option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.
  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
  options:
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
    
  4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and
  installed at any time.  
   
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
  options:
            Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*55'
                                 =========
   
  6.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to other
  CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
   
  7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
