Under certain circumstances, if an entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
"BLD",910,1,3,0)
was reactivated - that is if the INACTIVATION DATE field (#21) was deleted -
"BLD",910,1,4,0)
this deletion was not captured in the VA FileMan audits and therefore was
"BLD",910,1,5,0)
not transmitted to the field.  The cause of this problem has been removed.
"BLD",910,1,6,0)
This patch corrects those entries which have an inactivation date but
"BLD",910,1,7,0)
should not.
