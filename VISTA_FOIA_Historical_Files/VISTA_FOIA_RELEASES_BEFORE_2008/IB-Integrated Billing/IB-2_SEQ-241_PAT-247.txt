 CV2 project Overview
 --------------------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat 
 Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation 
 From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service 
 Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other 
 medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of 
 service connection.
  
 Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed 
 and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this 
 type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the 
 number of product line dependencies.  Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim 
 Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in 
 the Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  
 It provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for 
 the combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports 
 cross-referenced against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing 
 process.  Phase II of this initiative will involve multiple product lines 
 and additional VistA only development.  The main goals of Phase II will 
 be to fully automate the copayment billing processing of combat vets 
 based on episode of care by providing the appropriate questions at 
 check-out as supplied by CPRS.
  
 Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include 
 Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE), 
 Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF.  The National Patient 
 Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload 
 reporting.  The patches are listed below in the order that they must be 
 installed:

     DG*5.3*565     / released
     EC*2.0*54     /
  
 Product Features
  
 There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
 a. Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical care
 -The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those veterans 
 who qualify as such per the directive
 -The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate 
 audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel, 
 schedulers, etc.)
 -Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran was 
 for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same manner 
 as identification of exposure related care; care for SC conditions, etc.
 b. Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as 
 Combat Related
 -Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to 
 identify these patients and services provided care for a combat related 
 condition
 c. Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care, 
 prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose 
 treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless 
 changed by pharmacist.
  
 This patch IB*2.0*247 is the IB portion of the Combat Veterans (CV)-Phase
 II project.
  
 CV2 Patch Overview 
 ------------------
 A. Inpatient Encounters
 -----------------------
 1. Preclude appropriate CV related 1st party copays.
 All necessary modifications have been made in the CVIS patch IB*2.0*234.
 2. Preclude appropriate CV related 3rd party bills.
 All necessary modifications have been made in the CVIS patch IB*2.0*234.
 3. Preclude 1st party copays for O&E OBSERVATION and EXAMINATION 
 admissions. The CV patients will be shown in [IB OUTPUT EVENTS REPORT].
 4. The discharge bulletin for special cases will contain a 
 warning message if COMBAT VETERAN status has expired during inpatient 
 stay.
  
  
 B. Outpatient Encounters.
 ------------------------
 1. Preclude 1st party copays for CV Outpatient Appointments (non-pharmacy)
 -Modifications have been made to preclude 1st party copays if treatment 
 is related to CV. 
 -Modifications have been made to display CV classification result in [IB 
 OUTPUT EVENTS REPORT]
 "Outpatient/Registration Events Report"
 -Modifications have been made to create or cancel copays due to editing 
 of classification questions 
 in "EC  Edit Classification" option of "Appointment Management"  [SDAM
 APPT MGT]  and "Make Appointment" [SDM] (check-out screen) menu options.
 -If the stop code for the clinic prevents asking classification questions 
 then the outpatient encounter will be billed even if the patient has an 
 active CV status. In this case the user will be notified by e-mail 
 bulletin about the charges made to that CV veteran. IB staff needs to 
 consider the case and cancel the copay if necessary.
  
 2. Preclude 3rd party billing for CV Outpatient Appointments 
 (non-pharmacy)
 -Modifications have been made to Claims Tracking to preclude the 3rd 
 party bill by flagging 
 with CV status [IB MT NIGHT COMP] "Queue Means Test Compilation of 
 Charges". The same modification should be made for "Head Neck Cancer" 
 cases.
 -The text regarding CV and Head Neck Cancer has been added to the 
 bulletin that is sent 
 by [IBT SUP MANUALLY QUE ENCTRS] "Manually Add Opt. Encounters to Claims 
 Tracking" 
 -Modifications have been made to preclude appearance of CV treatments in 
 [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED REPORT] 
 "Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report".
 -Modifications have been made to display CV condition in [IBT OUTPUT 
 BILLING SHEET] "Print CT Summary 
 for Billing" menu option.
  
 C. Outpatient Pharmacy.
 -----------------------
 1. The Alert message to the mail group IB COMBAT VET RX COPAY for Pharmacy
 staff was introduced by the CVIS project  (IB*2.0*234). The decision has
 been made to keep this message in the CV2 project and enhance this
 functionality including Prescription number  (RX#) in its text.
 2. CV related pharmacy prescription entries in Claims Tracking will be
 marked as "NEEDS SC DETERMINATION" if the veteran doesn't have Service
 Connected status and has Combat Veteran status active to preclude 3rd
 party billing.
  
 D. Updating files
 -----------------
 1. The new charge removal reason "COMBAT VETERAN" has been added in file 
 #350.3 .
 2. The new non-billable reasons "HEAD/NECK CANCER" and "COMBAT VETERAN" 
 have been added in file #356.8 .
  
 E. CV Billing Verification Report
 --------------------------------- 
 There was a problem with the Registration API that was delivered in the
 CV-Interim Solution project. The problem is that if a veteran gets
 treatment that is CV related on the FINAL day of the two year coverage
 period, the Registration API returned that the veteran is NOT covered.  
 Therefore there is a chance that IB created co-payment charges and sent
 out bills for the FINAL day of a patient's CV status. This error in the
 Registration API has been corrected but this report should be run after
 the patch installation to provide the site with  a list of veterans that
 potentially could be billed incorrectly (if any).
  
 PLEASE NOTE that copayment charges and/or insurance bills printed in the 
 report are not necessarily related to the COMBAT VETERAN status. Before
 making a decision about their cancellation, IB personnel needs to review
 these copayments/bills to check whether they were related to the COMBAT 
 VETERAN status or not.
  
 The CV Billing Verification Report is a one-time report to assist billing
 clerks in finding potential bills generated by mistake. The report will 
 include Patient Name, SSN, bill number and PATIENT/INSURANCE indicator 
 (PATIENT - for copayment, INSURANCE - for 3-rd party). To run the report 
 the user needs to execute the subroutine RPT^IB20P247 from programmer 
 mode manually. Here is an example:
 >D RPT^IB20P247
  
 ...Please wait...
                >> CV Billing Verification Report <<
 ----------------------------- ------------ ----------- ------------------
 Name                          SSN          Date        Bill #
 ----------------------------- ------------ ----------- ------------------
 PATIENT,AAAAAA                000-00-0000  JAN 14,2004 K3008T5 PATIENT
 PATIENT,BBBBBB                000-00-0000  JAN 25,2004 K300C51 PATIENT
 PATIENT,CCCCCC                000-00-0000  JAN 23,2004 K300C5W INSURANCE
 ----------------------------- ------------ ----------- ------------------
 Total: 3 bills/copays
 >
  
 Note:   The probability of a veteran inappropriately receiving copayments/
 bills on the FINAL day of CV status is quite small so most sites will
 generate a blank report.  However, if bills are reported and they were
 related to CV, the user should use the existing manual process for
 reversing the ramifications of sending an inappropriate bill.
