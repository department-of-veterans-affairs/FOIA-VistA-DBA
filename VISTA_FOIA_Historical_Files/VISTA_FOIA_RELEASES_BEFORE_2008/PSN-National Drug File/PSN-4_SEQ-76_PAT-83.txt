Description:
============

 ***********************************************************
 PLEASE NOTE: 
 This patch should only be loaded during NON-PEAK hours.
 Installation time will take possibly 30 minutes or more.
 ***********************************************************
  
 Certain products added to the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) by patch
 PSN*4*79 should have caused an interaction warning but did not.
 This patch addresses that problem.
  
 Corrective Action
 =================
     This patch will automatically re-index the "APD" cross reference in
     the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56), which is what triggers the order
     check warning.  Re-indexing this cross reference will properly
     rebuild the index and resolve this problem.
  
 Routine PSN4P77 has been created to automatically re-index the "APD"
 cross reference in the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) via a VA FileMan call.

 ***WARNING*** This patch should only be loaded during NON-PEAK hours.
               Installation time will take possibly 30 minutes or more.
  
    1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
    4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*83)
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure
            the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSN*4.0*83.
  
    6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
  
    7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  Enter the Device you want to print
        the Install messages.  You can queue the install by entering a 'Q'
        at the device prompt.  Enter a "^" to abort the install.
  
    8.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
