Subject: APPROVE REQUESTS OPTION AND FMS TRANSMISSION CODES

Category: 
  - Print Template
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct two issues.
  
 The first issue is an error in the Approve Requests [PRCSAPP] option which
 causes it to fail when the | character is used in an item description.
  
 The second issue is inconsistencies in Transaction Type codes between 
 IFCAP and FMS.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HD55516  <UNDEF>BEGIN+30^PRCST5:3
    
    Problem:
    --------           
    There is an <UNDEF> error which can occur in the Approve Requests option
    when an item description contains a vertical bar ( | ) character.  The
    underlying problem is a FileMan call to format the output.  FileMan uses
    the vertical bar character as a special indicator and gets confused when
    it occurs in normal text.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    This patch changes the PRCS APPROVE REQUEST print template so that the 
    output is displayed without resorting to the FileMan call.
    
  
 2. HD103244  IFCAP routine update needed
    
    Problem:
    --------           
    In November 2004 the Financial Management System (FMS) changed the set of 
    Transaction Type codes which it will accept for Standard Voucher (SV)
    transactions generated for inventory activity.  The IFCAP development team 
    was unaware of this change and thus did not upgrade the matrix for 
    assigning Transaction Type codes to be compatible with what is now in the 
    Production FMS account.  
    
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    This patch will restore consistency between IFCAP and FMS in
    Transaction Type code assignments on SV transactions.  The routine
    PRCPSFSV has been updated to contain and transmit the correct set of
    codes.
