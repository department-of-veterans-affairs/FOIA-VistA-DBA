  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1. ISP-0404-N0472    NEW REPORT TYPE FROM AAC
  
     Problem:
     --------
     There is an electronic billing results report available from Austin
     Automation Center that is not in the IB ELECTRONIC REPORT DISPOSITION
     (#361.2) file.  This report is labeled R0S0.  Currently the data is
     being sent to the sites mixed in on another report.  So although sites
     have been receiving the information, it may have been overlooked since
     it was not separated out.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The Austin Automation Center will begin to send the R0S0 data in a
     separate message using the R0S0 designation.  This patch will add the
     report to the IB ELECTRONIC REPORT DISPOSITION (#361.2) file so that 
     the system will recognize it and so that the parameters can be edited
     with the Electronic Report Disposition option [IBCE ELEC REPORT
     DISPOSITION]. The name of the report will be PRF GVT WEBMD/PAYER
     INFO/EDIT. The default disposition value for the new report will be
     MAIL REPORT TO MAIL GROUP.  The R0S0 report will be mailed to the IB
     EDI mail group as are the other reports that are flagged to be mailed.
  
  TECHNICAL:
  ==========
  1.   ISP-0404-N0472    NEW REPORT TYPE FROM AAC
    
  A new record is added to the IB ELECTRONIC REPORT DISPOSITION
  (#361.2) file.  The new entry will look like this:
  ^IBE(361.2,nn,0) = R0S0^1^PRF GVT WEBMD/PAYER INFO/EDIT
    
  Report details and usage:
  a)  The report contains claim rejection information received by the
  payer via X12 997 from their preprocessing system.  These rejections do
  not appear on standard payer reports (as they are created before claims
  actually enter payer's processing/adjudication system).  It is critical
  that sites review these reports, correct any claim errors reported and
  resubmit claims.
  b)  The report also contains informational data from the WebMD 
  professional government clearinghouse.  This information can include
  notice of new edits/requirements implemented for specific payers, notice
  of claim processing delays, etc.
