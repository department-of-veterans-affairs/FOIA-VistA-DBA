 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD87423   Status of original consult changes from closed to active 
              when cloned. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The status of original consult changes from closed to active when it is 
 cloned and an Initial Action is taken on the suspense record.  Also,  
 same occurs if posting initial comment to cloned suspense record via
 Prosthetics GUI Suite.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR9CA and RMPREOS to only post note of initial action
 and not change status to pending in the 668 file.
  
  
 2. HD174902  Prosthetics ordering issue for multiple orders against 
              suspense
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When multiple orders are processed against the same suspense record, the
 first order does not close out the suspense item and the related items 
 (660) appear to be unlinked to the 668 record.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRSP7 to check actual suspense link between issue in 
 the Record of Prosthetics Appliance/Repair File (#660) and the Prosthetics
 Suspense File (#668) instead of complete/pending flag in issue
 record.
  
  
 3. HD180643  Prosthetics GUI Delayed Order Report problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Prosthetics GUI Delayed Order Report in the Prosthetics Vista Suite
 have Prosthetics cancelled consults that have growing number of delayed
 days in the DOR grid because there is no Initial Action Date entered.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR9DO to set the calculated days using the cancel date
 when the initial action date does not exist. Add aging calculation to
 RMPREOU to calculate between suspense creation date and cancellation date.
 ** The cancel date WILL NOT display in the 1st Action date field when
    used for aging calculation in lieu of a null initial action date.
