Subject: Outpatient Pharmacy Automated Refill Back Billing

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will allow for Outpatient Pharmacy Copay back-billing for 
 refills that were completed through the Outpatient Pharmacy Automated
 Interface (OPAI v2.4) two way interface only.  Executing the back-billing
 process is optional when installing this patch.  Each site can determine
 if they would be better suited to run this automated back-bill process or
 correct them manually.
  
 If you answer N (No) to running the back-billing and later change your
 mind and would like to run the back-billing, then you must re-install
 the patch.
  
 This patch will re-examine the Prescription file (#52) for refills that
 qualify to be back-billed and then bill them.  A Mailman message will be
 sent at the conclusion with a summary of the billing and you may manually
 run a detailed report option at that point.  The data will be stored in
 the ^XTMP("PSOCPBK3") global for 90 days, and the data will be purged
 after this time period.
  
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. HD113243  Back Billing of missed RX Copays
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the new OPAI interface and a refill is dispensed by an
 External dispensing machine and auto-release is enabled, Co-pays are not
 being billed.  The fill # variable used by the Co-pay Logic was not being
 initialized and therefore was not billed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Patch PSO*7*209 was released to correct the problem and patch PSO*7*215 
 produced a Tally report of the unbilled automated refills.  This patch 
 re-runs the same logic in PSO*7*215 to determine what refills should be 
 billed and then bills them.

 Features of this patch:
 1.  Prompts at install whether to run the Back-Bill process.
 2.  Summary mailman messages.
 3.  Detailed Results Report by Veteran can be run from Programmer mode.
 4.  Query Status of job while it is running.
 5.  Stop Job command.
  
 * See samples section below for images of these features.
  
 1. The Back-Bill process will produce a summary mail message of its 
    findings and display instructions on how to print a detailed report by 
    Veteran.  This MailMan message will be sent to all users that hold the 
    'PSO COPAY' security key and the installer of the patch.
  
    
    A summary management mailman message, with the billing results by year 
    and 30, 60, and 90 day fills, will be sent back to individuals to 
    facilitate Management spreadsheet creation.
  
    A third mail mailman message will also be sent to Management who will 
    cut and paste this information into a .TXT file to send to AAC
    personnel, in Austin, for letter generation.
  
 2. A detailed report by Veteran and refill number can be produced on 
    demand by entering D RPT^PSOCPBK4 at the programmer prompt.  Reviewing 
    this report will aid you in identifying patients who may need to have
    their medication copayment charge released.
  
 3. To check the status of the back-billing background job while it is
    running, then type from the direct programmers prompt the command
    D STATUS^PSOCPBK3.
  
 4. If you need to stop the back-billing background job for any reason,
    then from the direct programmers prompt, type the command
    D STOP^PSOCPBK3.

 Installation will take less than 2 minutes, but the back-billing job may 
 take several hours.
  
 Once the back-billing job has completed and you receive the Mailman 
 messages defined in the above Technical Detail and Samples Sections, if 
 any fills were billed please run the routine RPT^PSOCPBK4 from 
 programmers mode to generate a detailed report for retention by your 
 facility's billing office. See sample of report in above Samples 
 Section.  Please produce this report so that your billing office will 
 have it as a reference to use if patients should call with  questions 
 regarding the back-billing. The information needed to generate this 
 report will remain on your system for 90 days after the patch is 
 installed, and then will automatically be deleted.
  
 A stop command has been provided in case the system needs to be shutdown 
 for an emergency or other reasons such as this.  Then when the system
 is back up and you are ready you may restart the job and it will resume
 where it left off.  You may restart by entering D ^PSOCPBK3 at the
 programmer's prompt.
