Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 APIS FOR NATIONAL DRUG FILE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will
 be used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or
 writes to the National Drug File (NDF) files. Since the VA GENERIC file
 (#50.6) and other NDF-related files are being replaced by a vendor
 product, any direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be
 replaced by calling the APIs provided in this patch.
  
 When the new data source is in place, the calling applications will not 
 be required to make any changes, because these APIs will be flexible 
 enough to retrieve the requested data from the vendor product, when the 
 time comes.
  
 These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
 direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
 replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation includes:
  
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PSN_4_P80_TM_CP.pdf              Technical Manual (change pages)
   PSN_4_TM_R1004.pdf               Technical Manual (updated)
   PHARM_REENG_1_API_MANUAL.PDF     Pharmacy Re-Engineering API Manual
