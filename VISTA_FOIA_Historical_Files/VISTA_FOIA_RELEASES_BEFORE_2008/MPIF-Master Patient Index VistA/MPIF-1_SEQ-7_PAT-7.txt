Subject: ACK on for MPIF ICN-A02 SERVER and Local/Missing Job Fix

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

   Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
   release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
   installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
   Implementation Manager for CIRN.
   
   
   Issue 1:  It is possible for messages being sent to the MPI to not be 
   completely received and the HL7 package is not aware of this and will
   not automatically resend the message.  To prevent messages from being
   lost, HL7 level acknowledgements are being enabled for the messages
   sent during the implementation seeding process as well as the Local/
   Missing ICN Resolution job.  These ACKs just inform the sender that
   the message has been successfully received.  If the ACK is not received
   at the sending site, the message will be sent again.  The Protocol 
   (#101) file entry "MPIF ICN-Q02 SERVER" will be modified to have the
   field ACCEPT ACK CODE set to AL.  Protocol MPIF TEST is a subscriber
   of MPIF ICN-Q02 SERVER and is being exported to be sure the link
   remains.
  
   Issue 2:  Washington DC reported that an undefined error happens in HL7
   with the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Job when the associated protocols
   are out of order.  The error happened in HL7 because the MPIFRES routine
   did not quit after the INIT^HLFNC2 routine returned the error message
   that the protocol was disabled.  This has been corrected in MPIFRES.
  
   Issue 3:  The HL7 Application Parameter (#771) file entry MPIF CMOR CHNG
   was exported with the Facility Name field set to 662. It should be the
   station number at the site it was installed at.  This is not causing any
   hard errors, but will be corrected in the Post-Init (MPIFPST7) of
   this patch. Reported by Chris Link - CIRN Developer, ISC-BIRM.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
   
    2.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    3.  Verify that the Local/Missing ICN Resolution job is not currently
        running or scheduled to run in the next 5 minutes.  If it is
        running, wait until it has finished to install this patch.  If it
        is scheduled to run in the next 5 minutes, reschedule the job to
        run in 15 minutes.
   
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
   
    5.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    6.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
   
    7.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
    8.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*7.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond No.
  
    10.  The Post Init routine MPIFPST7 will automatically be deleted upon
         successful completion of the patch installation.
