Subject: NAME EDIT CORRECTION IN EXCEPTION HANDLER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
 systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
 Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
 or subscribers.
    
 This patch corrects the name edit in the [MPI/PD EXCEPTION HANDLING] 
 RG EXCEPTION HANDLING process. This patch aligns this process with the
 other name edit process, i.e.:[DG REGISTRATION MENU] Registration Menu,
 [Load/Edit Patient Data]

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1. MAC-1004-60387  MPI doesn't follow naming standardization  bdj
  
    
    Problem:
    -------
    The current RG EXCEPTION HANDLING, name edit process did not conform to
    the standard name edits of registration. For example it allowed extra
    comas in the name.
     
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The process was updated to use the same edits as the: [DG REGISTRATION 
    MENU] Registration Menu   [Load/Edit Patient Data] process.
