Description:
============

     +----------------------------------------------------------------+
     |  VACO needs to collect 2nd quarter (April 15) summary reports  |
     |  with station numbers on them, so if at all possible, please   |
     |  install this patch before April 15.                           |
     +----------------------------------------------------------------+
  
 This patch provides enhancements and fixes to the Radiology Performance
 Indicator reports.
  
  
 OVERALL CHANGE TO THE SUMMARY REPORT
  
  
 1.  A check for the beginning date has been added, so that it must be at 
     least 10 days before today, to coincide with the same 10 day
     restriction for the ending date.  This is done to fix a bug 
     identified in NOIS BHS-0703-11033.
  
  
 OVERALL CHANGES TO BOTH SUMMARY AND DETAIL REPORTS
  
  
 2.  A new prompt has been added to the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA
     PERFORMIN RPTS] option:
           Select Primary Interpreting Staff Physician (Optional):
  
     The user may enter a physician's name here to generate a summary or 
     detail report only for this physician's exams.  If the user bypasses
     this prompt by pressing the return key, then all radiologists' exams
     would be counted.
  
  
 3.  A new footnote has been added to explain that only 1 report is
     expected from a printset of several exams that share the same report.
  
  
 4.  Station and VISN numbers have been added to the report header, on the 
     same line as the "Facility:" field.
  
  
 5.  The calculation for elapsed time to verification has been changed so
     that the first verified date is always used.  Previously, if a
     verified report was un-verified, then later verified again, the latest
     verified date was used in calculating the elapsed time.
  
  
 OVERALL CHANGE TO THE DETAIL REPORT
  
  
 6.  A new column, "Procedure Name", has been added to the Detail Report.  
     The procedure name is truncated to the first 11 characters.  In order 
     to fit the new column in this report, the Imaging Type column has
     been shortened so that the Imaging Type is truncated to the first 3
     characters. 
  
     E3R: 18563
  
  
 NEW OPTIONS
  
  
 7.  The 'Run Previous Month's Summary Report' [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM] option
     has been added to the 'Performance Indicator...' [RA PERFORMIN MENU]
     option.
  
     This option calculates the previous month's Summary Report and sends
     it to the Outlook Mail group(s) defined for Performance Indicator
     reporting.  If there is no Outlook Mail group defined, then nothing
     would be sent.

     Select Performance Indicator Option: 
        RUN Previous Month's Summary Report

     The Summary Report of Last Month's data will be sent to the following
     Outlook mail group(s) defined in File 79's PERF INDC SMPT E-MAIL

     Do you want to continue? YES
                              ---
      The requested start time must be within day 10 through the last
      day of the current month.
  
      Enter date/time to start this Task:  (1/10/2004 - 1/31/2004): 1/30

 8.  'Schedule Perf. Indic. Summary for 15th of month' [RA PERFORMIN
     SCHEDULE] option has been added to the 'IRM Menu' [RA SITEMANAGER]
     option.
  
     This allows the IRM staff to schedule the "RA PERFORMIN TASKLM - Run
     Previous Month's Summary Report" task, if it got deleted from the 
     Taskman queue.  This option will automatically display the scheduled
     run date/time and task number.

 ROUTINE ADDED   
  
 9.  RA44PST is the post-installation routine.  It will add the option
     [RA PERFORMIN TASKLM] to the OPTION SCHDULING file #19.2.  Then,
     it will task off a background job to schedule the option to run
     on the 15th of the current month or the next month, whichever is
     the closest date in the future.
  
  
 ROUTINES CHANGED
  
 10. Routines RAPM, RAPM1, RAPM2, and RAPM3 have been changed to make 
     the enhancements and fixes described above.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   The install time for this patch should take less than 5 minutes.  
 However, if you choose to rebuild Menu Trees, the installation may take a 
 long time.  Please check with your IRM supervisor regarding rebuilding
 Menu Trees.  Since the changes apply only to the Performance Indicator
 menu, this patch can be installed when there are few Rad/Nuc Med users on
 the system.  These few users will be able to continue their work within
 the current Radiology option, but will not be able to choose a different
 Radiology option during the installation.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*44.
   
        When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
        Install? YES//, respond NO if you don't want to rebuild menu trees
        now; otherwise, respond YES.
  
        When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
        YES//", respond YES.      
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med
        options:
      
           RA*
   
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
           RA*
   
     5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*44).
  
     6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
     7. Check the Taskman Queue for the following 2 tasks:
      
  
        (1) This task should appear after the install, but should disappear
            about 2 minutes later:
  
            SCHED^RA44PST, RA*5.0*44 Schedule RA PERFORMIN TASKLM on 15th.
  
  
        (2) This task should appear about 2 minutes after the install:
  
            RA PERFORMIN TASKLM - Run Previous Month's Summary Report.
  
        After task (2) appears, you may delete routine RA44PST.
