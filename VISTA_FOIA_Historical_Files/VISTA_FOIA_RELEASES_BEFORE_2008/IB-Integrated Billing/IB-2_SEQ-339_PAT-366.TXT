Subject: SCHEDULING ENCAPSULATION UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a follow-up in response to the Scheduling Encapsulation
 project.  The Integrated Billing package is being enhanced to utilize new
 Scheduling APIs.  Previously patch IB*2*249 was released to utilize those
 APIs.  Since then two additional touch points have been identified.  Users
 should see little change in the Integrated Billing options they currently
 use as a result of this change.

 Options/Routines Affected
 -------------------------
 Patients Without MEDICARE (WNR) Insurance [IBCEM PATIENTS W/O MEDICARE]
 Routine:  IBCEMMR
 This report shows living patients that have active insurance, but no
 MEDICARE (WNR) insurance on file.  The other active insurance must be
 Medigap, or Medicare Secondary type insurance.  In these cases, MEDICARE
 (WNR) should be the primary insurance.  This was released for the MRA
 project.  The change made to support the new scheduling APIs may result 
 in some patients not showing a next/last appointment date on the report.  
 The scheduling APIs require that a patient be assigned a national ICN 
 (Integration Control Number) before appointment information can be 
 obtained.  Additionally the report previously displayed appointments that 
 were cancelled, an additional screen was added to avoid those 
 appointments.
  
  
 Two internal IB APIs were created to provide support for the IB package to
 look up the patient's LAST or NEXT appointment.  The internal APIs are 
 $$LAST^IBSDU and $$NEXT^IBSDU.
  
 Routine IBACKIN is obsolete and is being deleted with the install of this
 patch.  You may not have this on your system, but if you do, the routine 
 will be deleted.
