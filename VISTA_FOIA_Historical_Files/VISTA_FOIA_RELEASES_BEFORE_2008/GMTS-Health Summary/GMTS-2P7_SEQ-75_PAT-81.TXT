Subject: VHA Enterprise Standard Title Display in Health Summary Components

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch exports changes to the displays for the Progress Notes (PN),
 Selected Progress Notes (SPN), and Discharge Summary (DCS) components.  
 Both the Local TIU Title and VHA Enterprise Standard Title will be 
 displayed in the above components with a caption of Local Title and 
 Standard Title respectively. 
   
 This patch is an important successor to TIU*1*211, which maps local 
 document titles to Standard Titles in preparation for the upcoming unified
 Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository of computable patient
 data.
