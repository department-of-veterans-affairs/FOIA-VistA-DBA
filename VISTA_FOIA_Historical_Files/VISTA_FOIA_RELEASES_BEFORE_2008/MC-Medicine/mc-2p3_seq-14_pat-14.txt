============

 PATCH 5 AND 6 SHOULD BE INSTALLED BEFORE PATCH 14.                           
                                                                             
 This patch will fix the following:
                                                                             
 1) NOIS # MAR-0697-22511  WHEN PRINTING EP REPORT                           
    ROUTINE: MCARP and MCARP1                                                  
    OPTION: Results of EP Tests [MCFPEP]
                                                                             
    An undefined variable MCY error occurs when the option Results of EP Tests
    [MCFPEP] is used and the report is printed or queued to a printer.
                                                                             
 2) NOIS NCH-1197-41215 Pulmonary Function formula (BSA) Body surface
    ROUTINE: MCBPFTP1, MCPFTP1, and MCPFTP1A                                     
    OPTION: PFT Report [MCFPPFT], and Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT]
                                                                             
    An undefined variable BSA would occur when the user selects the PFT Report
    and Brief PFT Report.  This only happens if the site used the variable
    BSA in a formula in both the PFT Formula file (#700.2) and in PFT        
    Predicted Values file (#700.1).

  This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:    
  1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build 
      onto your system.                                                      
  2) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the                
     option 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all        
     routines have the correct checksums.                                    
  3) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option                    
     'Install Package(s)'.  Select the package 'MC*2.3*14' and proceed 
     with install.                                                           
  4) If you are a MSM site move the routines to the other servers.       
  5) On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
