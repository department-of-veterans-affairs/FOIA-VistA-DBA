Subject: ERROR WHILE VIEWING CLAIM [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW]

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 *************************NOTE***************************************
 This patch does NOT conflict with CoreFLS and can be installed at 
 CoreFLS sites.
 ********************************************************************
 
 This fix addresses all DGBT routine calls to COMMA^%DTC.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
 1. SBY-0304-30527     COMMA+3^%DTC:2
  
  Problem:
  --------
   When running the [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW]  View of Claim option a 
   %DSM-E-STRLEN was generated at COMMA+3^%DTC:2. The variable X3 is
   being leftover from some other option. (Please note that in a CACHE 
   system this error will not occur, but the display will be mis-aligned.)
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
   The variable X3 is an optional variable used by the routine COMMA^%DTC. 
   It is not used or set by DGBT routines with the exception of one. In 
   that case the variable is set and killed correctly. This patch addresses
   the remaining 22 calls from DGBT routines to COMMA^%DTC. In these cases
   the variable will be NEWED prior to calling COMMA^%DTC. In this way we 
   will prevent a left over copy of the variable X3 from being used 
   inadvertently by COMMA^%DTC when called by DGBT routines.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes, and can be installed at 
  any time. Users can be on the system when installing.
  
  Patch DGBT*1.0*7 is OK to install at CoreFLS sites.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution 
           Backup a Transport Global  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DGBT*1.0*7):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DGBT*1.0*7 .
  
    a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//', answer NO.
    b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? YES//', answer NO.
  
  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
