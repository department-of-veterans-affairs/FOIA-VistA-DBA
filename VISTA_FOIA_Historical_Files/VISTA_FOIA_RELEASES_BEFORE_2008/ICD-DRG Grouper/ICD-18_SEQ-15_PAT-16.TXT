 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that Medical Records coders be off the system. 
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Review your mapped set.
     If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE section are mapped, they
     should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*16):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the Transport Global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*16.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO. 
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS;
 ==========================
 Please refer to informational patch DG*5.3*660 which is repeated below
 for your convenience:
  
 The following statement was omitted from the Installation Instructions
 in patch ICD*18*14 released February 8, 2005:
  
     Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs option in order to make the transfer DRGs
     correspond to the appropriate grouper.
  
     This should be done soon after installing the patch, but should 
     be run at a time when PTF options are not in use.
     
     This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records
     opened during the current fiscal year (since 10/1/2004).
     
     The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
     is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
     current FY
