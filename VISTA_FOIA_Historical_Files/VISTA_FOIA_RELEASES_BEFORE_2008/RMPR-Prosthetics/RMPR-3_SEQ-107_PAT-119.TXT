Description:
============

 1)    This patch is a follow-up to patch RMPR*3.0*90 GUI Purchasing to 
 remove the VISTA Purchasing Option; Purchase Card Form [RMPR4 PC].
 The removal of this menu option has been approved by the Prosthetics Data
 Validation Committee.  This option must be removed to ensure the new 
 functionality introduced with GUI Purchasing is used nationally.  Further 
 submission of PURCHASE CARD PROSTHETICS PURCHASE ORDERS should take place 
 through the provided (GUI) Graphical User Interface options known as the 
 Prosthetics VISTA Suite.
  
  
 2) It was discovered that when picking 'Windows Printer' in Purchasing if 
 the following occurred the program would error with an Undefined error. On
 the Purchase Order Screen if any of these 4 fields are filled in and some
 are left blank the error occurred. After this patch any variation of 
 this data will print on the 'Windows Printer' Purchase order.
 MANUFACTURER 
 MODEL 
 SERIAL # 
 LOT # 
  
 3)  Also in the GUI 'Windows Print' if a Purchasing Agent picks the 
 Delivery to:   Other location at this site.  The Attention to:  would not
 print on the Purchase Order.  It will now print.
  
 4)  The Option WD     Display Prosthetic PO Information [RMPR WH DISPLAY]
 has been modified to display the Attention:  when the Purchasing Agent 
 Picks Other Location at this Site during the purchasing process.
  
 5) The post install routine ^RMPR119P in this patch will be run to check
 and make sure there is not any corruption to the package file.  This
 routine will be transported with all Prosthetics released patches until
 further notification.
