Associated patches: (v)DG*5.3*579  <<= must be installed BEFORE `DG*5.3*591'

Subject: Fix overlayed Means Test Thresholds

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will identify tests that were corrupted by Future dated Means
 Tests transmissions from the HEC.  Duplicate transmissions were uploading
 a previous Income Year, but with the current year's Means Test Threshold
 Values.  This test will be deleted and the correct previous Income Year
 test will be marked as Primary again and sent back to the HEC.
  
 This patch will also restore dependent income to a Means Test that was, 
 erroneously deleted by the Duplicate Income Test Purge Utility, while it 
 was removing a duplicate Means Test.  
  
 During installation, in step 6b, you will receive the following prompt: 
  
         Do you want to run the Post-install cleanup now? YES//
  
 If you chose not to run the post-install cleanup at the time the patch 
 is installed, you may start it manually from a programmer's prompt with 
 the following command:  D POST^DG53591
  
 This patch will send four bulletins when complete or stopped.  The first 
 two will deal with the bad Threshold cleanup and the second two will 
 deal with the restoring of the spouse income, when the spouse income
 became inactive or dis-associated, with the Veterans means test.
  
 The format of the two bulletins, per each cleanup, is basically the same.
 The first bulletin is a summary of how many records were processed and
 the second is detail showing which records were fixed and how.
  
 Note: If the first (summary) bulletin indicates there were no records
 cleaned up by the processes, the detailed message will not be generated.
  
  
 Example bulletins:
