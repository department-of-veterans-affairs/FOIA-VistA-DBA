Subject: TASKMAN FIX FOR XU*8*163

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Numerous NOIS's found a problem in the TaskMan Monitor after installing 
 XU*8*163.  Patch *163 set the %ZTSCH node rather than %ZTSK node.  This 
 patch should be install immediately after *163 is installed.
  
 POST^ZTMS2 was added to ZTMS2 to clean-up nodes that were corrupted by 
 patch *163.  The KIDs post-init will call this tag to clean-up the nodes.
   
 NOIS CHA-0800-30357 is the primary NOIS tracking this fix.
