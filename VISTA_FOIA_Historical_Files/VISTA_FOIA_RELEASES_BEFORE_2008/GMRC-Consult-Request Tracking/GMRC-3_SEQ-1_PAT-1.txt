  GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  ===================
  
  This patch contains all of the routines for GMRC 3.0, one Input
  Template, and one Option. This patch fixes the following problems:
  
  1.  All of the routines that were distributed in the released 3.0
      version of CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING were inadvertently distributed
      with "3.0T9;CONSULTS/REQUEST TRACKING" in the second line, rather
      than "3.0;CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING".
  
      The routines in this patch are all of the routines that should be
      defined at the sites after CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING V3.0 is
      installed. The GMRC namespaced routines are redistributed in this
      build with the following version and patch information on the second
      line:
           ;;3.0;CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING;**1**;DEC 27, 1997
  
   2  The following changes were made to correct errors found by CPRS test
      sites.
  
      GMRC513U - Corrects an error which occurred when the patient's
                 location was not defined in the order
      GMRCADC -  Corrects the repeating prompt, "Select item", which
                 occurs when the user has selected an alert, and enters an
                 action before selecting the item from the list
      GMRCQCST - Resolves NOIS PUG-1297-50502: Taking <UNDEF> in
                 STS+5^GMRCQCST; Corrects an error which occurred when
                 a consult had a status of unreleased. 
      GMRCSLDT - Corrects code that displays the DOB on header.
      GMRCSLM1 - Changes the status displayed in List manager to 99 (No
                 status) if the status is not defined in a consult entry.
                 There should never be a consult without a status.  This
                 change to "99" is used for list manager display purposes
                 and does not update the consult entry in 123. Prior to
                 this correction, the logic used to set the status to
                 "Pending" in the consult entry in 123. The "99" for No
                 status is also used in CPRS for display purposes.
      GMRCT -    Removed logic that was stopping notifications to be sent
                 to the notification users, logic matches 2.5 now.
  
   3. The following routines were changed to call one location for message
      handling. It will now display the message and ask the user to press
      return to continue.  This was in response to sites saying they could
      not see the message being returned because it scrolled off the
      screen too fast.
  
      GMRC101C, GMRCA1, GMRCADC, GMRCAFRD, GMRCAR, GMRCASV, GMRCEDT1,
      GMRCEDT2, GMRCMCP, GMRCP513, GMRCPR0, GMRCR, GMRCR06, GMRCSLDT,
      GMRCSLM, GMRCSLM2, GMRCSLM3, GMRCSSP, GMRCSTU, GMRCTIU
  
   4. The following routines have added logic to clean-up variables:
  
      GMRCHL7, GMRCHL7A, GMRCMER, GMRCP, GMRCTIU
  
   5. The following routine was deleted in error when V3 was installed:
  
      GMRCA2    Resolves NOIS CTX-0198-71513: No such compiled routine
                error
  
   6. The following routine contains purge logic which will not actually
      be used until GMRC*3*3 is released. This routine is distributed in
      this patch so sites will not be able to run the purge used in 2.5.
  
      GMRCPURG  New logic - makes the 2.5 purge obsolete.
  
   7. The following routine contains updated logic for the Consults GUI
      interface:
  
      GMRCGUIA
  
   8. The following seven routines are deleted:
  
      GMRC11PS, GMRCFP, GMRCNTEG, GMRCPOR1, GMRCPRE, GMRCQCK,
      GMRCXMF
  
      Note: The post routines, GMRCPOS, GMRCPOS1 and GMRCPOST are not
      deleted because of the need to reuse the code for orderable item and
      consult service and procedure synchronization.  They will be deleted
      in a future patch.
  
   9. The GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE input template from the REQUEST
      SERVICES file (#123.5) was changed to remove a prompt, "PROTOCOL MENU
      OF REQUEST ITEMS", which should not have been prompted for, and add
      a new prompt 'SERVICE PURGING INDIVIDUAL'.  The new SERVICE PURGING
      INDIVIDUAL field will not be used until the purge and status
      management patches are available.
  
  10. The GMRC SITE PARAMETERS option is deleted from the Option File.
      The site parameters are not yet used in any of the 3.0 functionality.
      The GMRC SITE PARAMETER option is removed from the GMRC MGR menu
      items.
