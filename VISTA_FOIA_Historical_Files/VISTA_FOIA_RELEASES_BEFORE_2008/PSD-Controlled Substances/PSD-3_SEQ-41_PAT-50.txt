 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 HIN-0704-40700     NURSES ABLE TO WITNESS THEMSELVES
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Delayed Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DELAYED
 DISPENSE] option from Nursing Supervisor Menu [PSD NURSE SUPR MENU]
 option, the nurse that signed out the drug can also be entered as the
 witness.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 PSDRFS and PSDRFU will be modified to correct this problem.  If the
 nurse that signed out dose is the same as the witness, a message
 will be displayed of 'Witness and Sign Out Nurse can not be the 
 same person'. The user will then be sent back to the prompt to
 enter a new nurse.
