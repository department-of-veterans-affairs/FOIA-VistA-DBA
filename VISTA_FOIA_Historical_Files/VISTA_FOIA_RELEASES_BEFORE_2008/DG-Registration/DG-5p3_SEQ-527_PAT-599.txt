Description:
============

 This patch resolves the following issue:
 
 1.  Routines released in patch DG*5.3*559 changed the date in line 2 from 
     Aug 13, 1993 to Oct 20, 2003.
        
       o  Routines DGPTDRG,DGPTFIC,DGPTICD,DGPTOLC2 display the wrong date   
          in the second line. 
  
 2.  NOIS
     ----
     PRE-0704-61679  PTF 501 file problems
     HWH-0704-41974  PTF SCREEN FAILS TO PROMPT FOR ICD 1 ENTRY
     SAM-0804-20253  ptf menu-when adding dx code on MAS screen, defaults to icd2
     BOI-0804-50594  ICD 1 diagnosis not on 501 screen of PTF
     
     Sites reported that since Combat Veteran patch DG*5.3*565 has been 
     released, they are only allowed to add 4 diagnosis codes instead of 5 on 
     the MAS screen of the Load/Edit PTF Data option.  When the user selects 
     an "A" to Add Code, they are prompted with 'ICD2 ICD3 ICD4 ICD5' instead 
     of 'ICD1 ICD2 ICD3 ICD4 ICD5'.  Input template DG501 for PTF FILE #45 was 
     modified to correct this problem.
 
     To TEST:
     o  Select the Load/Edit PTF Data option from the PTF Menu.
     o  Select a patient.
     o  Go to the MAS screen.
     o  Select A from the bottom of the screen to Add Code.
