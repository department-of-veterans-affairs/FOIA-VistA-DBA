    non-peak time. It will take about one minute to install the
    patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
  
 2. DSM/AXP sites - Review your mapped routine set. If the routine
    in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section is mapped, disable mapping for
    the affected routine.
  
 3. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 4. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
    option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
 5. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
    You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
    menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Backup a Transport Global

                 Install Package(s)  
                 Select INSTALL NAME:XT*7.3*91
                                     ==========

 6. After installing this patch,
       Cache/GT.M Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
       DSM sites - you need to move the routine from
       your production account to each manager account:
  
       ZTP1
  
 7. And in the manager account,  (Cache/GT.M sites remain in VAH)
       All sites:
       DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
       Select the System
       Patch number to load: 91
                             === 
 8. If the routine was unmapped per STEP #2, the mapped set should be 
    rebuilt once the installation has run to completion.
