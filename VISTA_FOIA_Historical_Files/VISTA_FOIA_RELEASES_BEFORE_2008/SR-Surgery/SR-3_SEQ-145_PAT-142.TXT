  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) project.
 PFSS patches are being released on various schedules. Some patch
 functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is activated
 during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented at select
 pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for the
 implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing replacement
 system. The project consists of the implementation of the billing
 replacement system, business process improvements, and enhancements to
 VistA to support integration with the COTS billing replacement system.
 Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and ancillary packages are
 necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The ability
 for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at the
 appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/billreplace/
  
 Features of patch SR*3*142 are listed below:
  
 1. Modified Surgery Coding Option
    Coders currently use the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes 
    [SRCODING EDIT] option, which updates coded data directly in the 
    SURGERY file (#130). However, the SURGERY file (#130) does not
    currently make a distinction between procedure and diagnosis data
    entered by clinicians and that entered by coders. Today, coding a
    surgical case impacts the clinical data for the patient and causes an
    addendum to be generated because each code is directly associated with
    a free-text procedure or diagnosis entry. This patch separates final
    coded procedures and diagnoses from the clinically captured procedures
    and diagnoses.
  
    A new file, the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136), is
    created to store coded procedure and coded diagnosis data for a Surgery
    case. Data entered into this file will be the new source coding data
    sent by the Surgery package to PCE. In the SURGERY file (#130), the
    existing PRINCIPAL CPT Code field (#27), PRIN DIAGNOSIS CODE field 
    (#66), OTHER PROCEDURE CPT CODE field (#3 of sub-file #130.16) and ICD
    DIAGNOSIS CODE field (#3 of sub-file #130.18) are modified to include
    the word "PLANNED" in the field labels and titles.
    
    The Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes [SRCODING EDIT] option is 
    modified to allow entry of final billing Current Procedural 
    Terminology (CPT) codes for surgical procedures and International
    Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis codes in the SURGERY
    PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).
  
    Modified features of the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes
    [SRCODING EDIT] option are listed below:
    - Upon record creation for a case in the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
      CODES file (#136), the record will be auto-populated with clinician
      entered coding data, if any, from the SURGERY file (#130).
    - A principal ICD code and a principal CPT code are initial
      requirements for coding a surgical case. 
    - An unlimited number of ICD codes may be entered for other diagnoses
      and an unlimited number of CPT codes may be entered for other
      procedures performed.
    - Each CPT code entered must be assigned the associated ICD code(s)
      related to the procedure performed.
    - An unlimited number of CPT modifiers may be entered for each CPT code
      entered.
    - For every ICD code entered, the following questions must be answered
      as appropriate for the patient based upon enrollment indicators:
      o Treatment related to Service Connected condition?
      o Treatment related to Agent Orange Exposure?
      o Treatment related to Ionizing Radiation Exposure?
      o Treatment related to Environmental Contaminant Exposure?
      o Treatment related to Military Sexual Trauma?
      o Treatment related to Head and/or Neck Cancer?
      o Treatment related to Combat?
    - Upon completion of coding for a case, the coder is allowed to mark
      the record as complete and to send the record immediately to PCE.
    - Before allowing the record to be marked as complete, the option
      checks to see if a specific code, 065.0 CRIMEAN HEMORRHAGIC FEV, is
      entered as a diagnosis code. If it is entered, the software prompts
      the user to make sure that the code is correct for the case. This
      check is added to prevent the inadvertent assignment of code 065.0
      when "CHF" is entered for the Principal or Other ICD Diagnosis
      codes.
    
 2. Modified Surgery Reports and Other Options
    - The following Surgery reports and options as modified to use the
      coder entered CPT and/or ICD codes from the SURGERY 
      PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136):
      o Cumulative Report of CPT Codes [SROACCT] option
      o Report of CPT Coding Accuracy [SR CPT ACCURACY] option
      o List Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes [SRSCPT] option
        Note: The option descriptions are updated to read "The List
        Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes option generates a report of
        completed cases that are missing the Principal CPT code for a
        specified date range."
      o Annual Report of Surgical Procedures [SROARSP] option
      o PCE Filing Status Report [SRO PCE STATUS] option
      o Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] option
      o Report of Missing Quarterly Report Data [SROQ MISSING DATA] option
        Note: The Other CPT Codes no longer affect this report and 
        references to Other CPT Codes are removed. The display of "I" in 
        the footer of this report is removed.
      o Annual Report of Non-O.R. Procedures [SRONOP-ANNUAL] option
      o List of Invasive Diagnostic Procedures [SROQIDP] option
    - The following Surgery reports and options are modified to remove CPT 
      and/or ICD codes from the display.
      o Update Status of Returns within 30 Days [SRO UPDATE RETURNS] option
      o Update Operations as Unrelated/Related to Death [SRO DEATH RELATED]
        option
      o Non-OR Procedure Information [SR NON-OR INFO] option
      o Deaths Within 30 Days of Surgery [SROQD] option
      o Admissions Within 14 Days of Outpatient Surgery [SROQADM] option
      o List of Operations Included on Quarterly Report [SROQ LIST OPS]
        option
  
 3. Modified Risk Assessment Options
    - Surgery case CPT and/or ICD codes used in the following options are 
      displayed from the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136):
      o Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option
      o List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST] option 
      o Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT REASON] option
        Note: The new CPT code fields will not be editable from this
        option.
      o Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE] option
        Note: The new CPT code fields will not be editable from this
        option.
      o Queue Assessment Transmissions [SROA TRANSMIT ASSESSMENTS] option
    - In the following options CPT codes are removed from the screen
      headings:
      o Preoperative Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA PREOP DATA] option 
      o Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB] option
      o Operation Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA OPERATION DATA] option
        Note: The CPT code and Postoperative Diagnosis fields will not be 
        editable from this option. 
      o Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS] option
      o Intraoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO INTRAOP COMP] option
      o Postoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO POSTOP COMP] option
      o Clinical Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION]
        option
      o Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC] option
      o Enter Cardiac Catheterization & Angiographic Data [SROA 
        CATHETERIZATION] option 
      o Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE 
        RISK] option
        Note: The CPT code fields will not be editable from this option.
      o Cardiac Procedures Operative Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC 
        PROCEDURES] option
      o Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] option
      o Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC RESOURCE] option
    - The Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT]
      option is modified to remove the ability to edit CPT and ICD codes 
      from this option.
  
 4. Functions that are currently part of the Surgery Nightly Cleanup and 
    Updates [SRTASK-NIGHT] option are modified as follows:
    - Store Operation Times function uses the CPT code fields in the 
      SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).
    - File Surgery Data in PCE function is removed.
  
 5. The Surgery to PCE interface is modified to send coding data from the 
    SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136). The interface now passes
    data to PCE in real time when the coder completes the coding process
    for a case. After a case is filed with PCE, if certain data passed to 
    PCE is changed within the Surgery software, the Surgery to PCE
    interface sends an update to PCE immediately. ICD coding related data 
    is updated through the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes
    [SRCODING EDIT] option.

 Note: This patch includes a pre-installation process and a 
 post-installation process. The pre-installation process removes the 
 following MUMPS type cross references from the SURGERY file (#130): 
 "APCE14", "APCE25", "APCE28", "APCE15", "APCE2", "APCE24", "APCE26" and 
 "APCE8".
  
  The post-installation process performs the following tasks:
  - Files Surgery data in PCE for cases that are queued to file
  - Converts coding data in the SURGERY file (#130) to the new SURGERY
    PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136) for all completed cases

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed with Surgery users off the system. 
 Installation times may vary depending upon the number of cases converted 
 during the post-installation process. Installation of this patch may be
 queued.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*142):
  
    (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
        installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
        templates, etc.).
  
    (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
  
    (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
        components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*142.
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? NO//" respond YES.
  
 7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu options, and
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
    completion.
