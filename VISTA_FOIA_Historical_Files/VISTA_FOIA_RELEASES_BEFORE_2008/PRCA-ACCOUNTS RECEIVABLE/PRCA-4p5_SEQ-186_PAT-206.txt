 This patch modifies Patient Statements that are transmitted from the sites
 to the Austin Automation Center (AAC). The account number on these
 statements currently contain the patient's Social Security Number (SSN).
 This patch replaces the SSN portion of the account number with the
 patient's Data File Number (DFN).
  
 To display the new format, the following options have been modified to
 display the statement account number, which contains the patient's DFN.
  
    1. FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE  [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE]
    2. BRIEF ACCOUNT PROFILE [PRCAY ACCOUNT PROFILE]
  
  
 RATIONALE
 ---------
 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Central Office has requested
 modifications to the Patient Statements that are transmitted from the
 sites to the Austin Automation Center (AAC). Their purpose is to
 increase security of patient account information. 
  
 On each of these patient statements, there is a patient account number
 that consists of a Medical Center identifier, patient SSN, and the last
 5 letters of the patient's name. This is used to identify the patient
 record when they call in to inquire about their account, as well as to
 track them for billing purposes. There is a need to replace the SSN, as
 this is a privacy issue.  
  
 Removing SSNs from patient account numbers will increase security, and
 support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
 requirements for protection of individually identifiable patient
 information.
  
  
 WHAT IS A DFN?
 --------------
 Whenever a new patient is registered, VistA will assign a new DFN for that
 patient. The DFN is a sequentially assigned number ranging from 1 to 10
 digits that VistA uses to identify and track a patient. It functions as an
 internal system ID.
  
  
 IMPLICATIONS
 ------------
 Agent Cashiers and Call Centers can still use the SSN on all patient
 lookups. This functionality has NOT changed, only the statements have
 been modified. All options associated with the Agent Cashier Menu [RCDP
 AGENT CASHIER MENU] will continue to accept the patient's name and SSN.
  
 Since the last 4 digits of the patient's SSN will no longer appear on the 
 statement, the patients, Agent Cashiers, and Call Centers will reference
 the statement by the DFN. Remember, the DFN is now part of the account
 number. Please review the following examples:
  
 FORMAT:
 -------
 Station number - Leading zeroes - DFN - Last Name (1st five characters)
  
 Example 1:  500 - 00000000000 - 42 - SMITH    
 Example 2:  619 - 000000 - 7169982 - JONES
 Example 3:  688 - 0 - 7168771.8992 - LOWEA
  
 * For example 1, the station number is 500, and the patient's DFN is 42.
  
 * In example 2, the station number is 619 and the patient's DFN is 7169982.
  
 * Example 3 has a station number of 688, and the patient's DFN is 7168771.8992.
   Some DFNs will contain a decimal, but this is extremely rare.
  
  
 SSN vs. DFN 
 -----------
 The DFN may be used for patient lookup. However, please be advised that
 DFN use differs from that of using a SSN. Entering the last 4 digits of
 the SSN will provide a partial match of patients from which to choose.
 This is not true for the DFN because the entire number must be entered.
 For the sake of this discussion, all references to patient lookup refer
 to the options under the Agent Cashier Menu [RCDP AGENT CASHIER MENU].
  
      
       AGENT CASHIER MENU
       ------------------
       Account Profile    [RCDP ACCOUNT PROFILE]
       Bill Profile       [RCDP BILL PROFILE]
       Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING]
  
  
       EXAMPLE 1: Joe Smith => DFN = 732145
                   John Doe => DFN = 2145
  
       In the 1st example, Joe Smith has a DFN of 732145, and John Doe
       has a DFN of 2145. The entire DFN, 732145 must be entered for
       Joe Smith because he last 4 digits of 732145 belong to another
       patient name John Doe.
  
       Also, unlike the SSN, the user must identify the DFN to VistA.
       This is accomplished with the use of special characters. There
       are 2 of them. They are semi-colon DPT and the grave (`).
       Please see special characters 1 and 2.
  
       SPECIAL CHARACTERS
       ------------------
       1. ;DPT (Semi colon joined with the letters "DPT)
       
       2. ` (Grave)
  
       Special character 2 is known as the grave. It is the character under
       the tilde (~), which is located on the upper left portion of the
       keyboard.
  
       When using "Account Profile", ;DPT must be entered with the DFN.
       Please see examples 3 & 4.
  
       EXAMPLE 3:
       Account Profile => Select ACCOUNT or BILL NUMBER: 732145;DPT
       
       EXAMPLE 4:
       Account Profile => Select ACCOUNT or BILL NUMBER: 2145;DPT
                    
       When processing a new patient under "Receipt Processing" the
       grave must be used with the DFN.  Please see examples 5 & 6.
                    
       EXAMPLE 5:
       Receipt Processing => PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER: `732145
  
       EXAMPLE 6:
       Receipt Processing => PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER: `2145
  
  
       REMINDER: Use of the DFN for patient lookup is NOT required.
                 The patients SSN or name may still be used. Lookup
                 functionality has NOT been changed.
  
  
 USING THE DFN FOR PATIENT LOOKUP
 --------------------------------
 When using the DFN for patient lookup, the user must enter the DFN in 
 conjunction with one of the special characters. Table 1 contains a list
 of commonly used AR options. It identifies which special character the
 user should invoke when the DFN is used for patient lookup.
  
 Special Note:  When using the DFN with a special character, the lookup
                will work with one or the other, NOT both. For example
                if the lookup for an option works with semi-colon DPT,
                it with not work with the "grave".  
  
                The reverse is also true. If the lookup for an option works
                with the "grave" and DFN, it with not work with semi-colon DPT.
