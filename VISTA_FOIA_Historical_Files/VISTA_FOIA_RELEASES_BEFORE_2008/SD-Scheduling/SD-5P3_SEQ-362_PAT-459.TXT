Subject: EMERGENCY RESPONSE INDICATOR-HURRICANE KATRINA ACRP WORKLOAD REPORTING

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Chief Business Office has requested that a new Emergency Response 
 Indicator (ERI) be created and populated with a "Hurricane Katrina" 
 designation for all those that we identify as being within the known 
 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated disaster areas.  A
 search has been run on a backup copy of the Health Eligibility Center's
 (HEC) production system to find those in the affected zip code regions.  
 The indicator will be populated on the HEC production system, transmitted
 to all medical centers that have seen the affected patient, and made
 available to all interested application groups (Patch DG*5.3*677).  As the
 patient moves from place to place, the indicator will follow to ensure the
 proper processing of billing, etc.  An option to enable users to manually
 set this indicator for veterans and non-veterans affected by the hurricane
 who were not identified through the automated mechanism will also be
 included in the above-mentioned patch.  In addition, the inclusion of this
 flag in workload transmissions (inpatient, outpatient, etc) to the 
 National Patient Care Database (NPCD) to facilitate workload and cost 
 capture for hurricane support will be added with these patches (DG*5.3*678
 & SD*5.3*459).
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to provide enhancements to the VistA 
 Scheduling v5.3 package to support the Emergency Response Indicator for 
 "Hurricane Katrina".
  
 These enhancements include the following functionality.
  
 *  Modify the outpatient ARCP transmission to Austin to include the ERI 
    flag of 'K' when available.
  
 *  Outpatient encounters transmitted after 8/25/05 will be re-queued for
    transmission if they contain an ERI flag of 'K' for the Ambulatory Care
    Reporting Project (ACRP).  These transmissions will automatically be
    sent to Austin Automation Center (AAC) via the AmbCare Nightly
    Transmission process and will not require manual intervention.
  
 PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE RE-TRANSMISSIONS INCLUDED WITHIN THIS PATCH WILL 
 NOT IMPACT CLOSE-OUT, THE REPORTING OF PTF/PCE RECORDS FOR THE ALLOCATION
 RESOURCE CENTER (ARC) OR ANY OTHER POST CLOSEOUT REPORTING.
  
  
 TECHNICAL OVERVIEW (ACRP Transmission)
 --------------------------------------
  
 The following section provides an overview of the functionality that will
 be provided with this patch.
  
 1. ACRP data is currently transmitted from VistA to the Austin Automation 
    Center (AAC) in an Update Patient Information (A08) HL7 message using 
    the Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission to NPCDB [SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY
    XMIT] option. The VA-Specific Patient Information Segment, ZPD, in the
    A08 message contains Patient Demographics related to the encounter.
  
    The following functional enhancements will allow the transmission of 
    the Emergency Response Indicator (ERI): 
  
    a.  The ZPD segment building routine for ACRP has been modified to
        include segments beyond 1 through 21.
  
    b.  The Emergency Response Indicator (ERI) flag - 'K' will be placed 
        in the ZPD Segment, piece 40.  It will be sent in the ACRP
        transmission if available.
  
    c.  Validation error checking will be added for a valid Emergency
        Response Indicator.
  
 2. The Post-Install routine of patch SD*5.3*459 will perform a one-time
    re-queue of patients effected by 'Hurricane Katrina" outpatient
    encounters. Additional information on this one-time re-queue process
    can be found within the Post Installation section in the patch
    description for patch DG*5.3*678.
