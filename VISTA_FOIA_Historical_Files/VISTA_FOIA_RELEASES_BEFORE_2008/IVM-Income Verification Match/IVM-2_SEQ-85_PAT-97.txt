 * In order to ensure that exemptions for unemployable veterans are      *
 * updated by the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) processes, coding      *
 * changes were necessary in 5 VistA software modules (DG, SD, IVM, IB   *
 * and PRCA) as well as the software at the HEC.                         *
 * The compliance date has been shortened due to the urgent nature of    *
 * the enhancement, and the fact that the HEC cannot install their       *
 * enhancements until ALL sites have completed installation of the VistA *
 * patches.                                                              *

 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
 HEC VistA Enhancements (HVE) provides software to support several critical
 business processes associated with congressionally mandated initiatives.
 Through the course of a three phase roll-out, a series of system
 application updates have been and are being made to support enhanced
 Enrollment functionality, both within VistA and the Health Eligibility
 Center (HEC), and updates to a series of veterans' enrollments, including 
 continuous enrollment, and eligibilities, including statuses of Combat 
 Veteran, former Prisoner of War (POW), Unemployable Veteran and Filipino 
 Veteran.
  
 The HVE Phase 3 project functionality enhancements include:
  
 - Unemployable Veteran Service Connection (SC) Priority Group Change
 - POW Veteran Pharmacy Copayment Exemption and Dental Treatment
 - Filipino Veteran Data Sharing with the HEC
 - Combat Veteran (Phase III) Enrollment Priority Updates and Data Sharing
   with the HEC
 - Military Service Date (MSD) Sharing with the HEC and, 
 - Continuous Enrollment Priority Updates 
  
 The HVE Phase 3 functionality will be introduced at all sites as part of 
 a combined effort that encompasses updates to:
  
 - Registration (Patch DG*5.3*564); IVM (IVM*2.0*97); Scheduling 
   (SD*2.0*395) (Distributed as Host File DG_53_P564.KID);
 - Integrated Billing (Patch IB*2.0*275); and, 
 - Accounts Receivable (Patch PRCA*4.5*218). 
  
 As there is no hard dependency between the patches, it is important to note 
 that some functionality respective to a given patch may not be fully functional
 until all patches are installed at the respective site. Each patch description
 will reference any such dormant functionality as part of its more detailed 
 functional explanation.
