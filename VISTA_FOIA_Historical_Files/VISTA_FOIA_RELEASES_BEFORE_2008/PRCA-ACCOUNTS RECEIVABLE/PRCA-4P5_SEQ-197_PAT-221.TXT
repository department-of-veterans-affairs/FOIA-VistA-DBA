 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
 1. MAR-0604-21979     BILL NUMBERS NOT BEING RECOGNIZED
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site couldn't access a bill when they entered a bill number in lowercase
    letters through the Brief Account Profile [PRCAY ACCOUNT PROFILE] option
    or the Full Account Profile [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE] option. The 
    bill will display if they used uppercase letters.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routine PRCAAPR to convert the user's entry from lowercase
    letters to uppercase letters by using $$UPPER^VALM1 extrinsic function.
  
 2. MOU-0904-30115     problem with RCDPURET routine
    
    Problem:
    --------
    While the EP (Edit Payment) under the Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT
    PROCESSING] option menu is running, if the payment on a receipt has
    an EEOB Worklist decrease adjustment associated with it, the variable
    RCXERA which stores a warning message causes an undefined error at line 
    <UNDEFINED>BR+1^DIE0.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCDPURET to define the variable in the main routine
    instead of the DO command line so the stored message regarding an EEOB 
    Worklist decrease adjustment can be displayed without an error.
