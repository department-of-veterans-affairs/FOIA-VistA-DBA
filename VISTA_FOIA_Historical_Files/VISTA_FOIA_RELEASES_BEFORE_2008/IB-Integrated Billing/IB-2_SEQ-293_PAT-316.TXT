Subject: IIV ENHANCEMENTS & PURGE ADJUSTMENT

Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses several items related to the Insurance Identification
 and Verification (IIV) functionality that were identified as problems or
 concerns. To prevent users from sending out unlimited IIV inquiries in a
 given day, the HL7 MAXIMUM NUMBER (#350.9, 51.15) field has been modified
 to be a required field. To prevent users from extracting unlimited IIV
 inquiries in a given day for an IIV data extract, the MAXIMUM EXTRACT
 NUMBER (#350.9002, .05) field has been modified to be a required field.
 Based on a decision from the VA Chief Business Office, it was decided that
 the most popular payer function should be removed. Any mention of this
 functionality should be eradicated from the IIV system. IIV routines will
 automatically disable and enable journaling while doing the purge. A log of
 when the IIV Purge is executed will now be kept in global ^XTMP("IBCNEKIT").
  
 The manual associated with this patch may be found in the OI Field Office 
 Anonymous.Software directories listed below.  The information contained 
 in IB_2_316_UM.PDF replaces "Section 1 - Site Parameters" of the existing 
 eIIV User Manual, IB_2_184_UM.PDF.

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD90144 - Problem with disabling journaling for the Purge IIV
 Transactions option
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD90144 - Problem with disabling journaling for the Purge IIV
 Transactions option
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Problem with disabling journaling for the Purge IIV Transactions option.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Disabling journaling at the global level in a cluster mounted CACHE
 configuration, is not supported. The user disabled journaling for their
 interactive process, but the routine tasked the purge to run at 8 P.M.
 which will run under a different process and therefore will be journaled.
 IIV routines will automatically disable and enable journaling itself while
 doing the purge.
  
  
 Overview of Patch Items:
 ------------------------
 1. MAXIMUM EXTRACT NUMBER (#350.9002, .05) and HL7 MAXIMUM NUMBER
 (#350.9, 51.15) fields should require responses.
  
 Prior to this patch the MAXIMUM EXTRACT NUMBER (#350.9002, .05) and HL7
 MAXIMUM NUMBER (#350.9, 51.15) fields were not required entries. The
 fields identify the maximum number of inquiries to be generated per
 extract and the maximum HL7 messages to be generated through the interface
 (this supersedes the total number identified for all extracts)
 respectively. If they were left blank, there was no limit imposed. This
 could be particularly problematic for the HL7 maximum as it could
 negatively impact HL7 traffic. In addition, the corresponding responses
 could flood the Insurance Buffer which would negatively impact the
 Insurance Verification staff. This will not set a default maximum value
 for those sites that currently have no value set. It will, however,
 require them to enter a value the next time they access those prompts
 within the IIV Site Parameters.
  
  
 2. PURGE IIV TRANSACTIONS - clustered cache systems can not disable
 journaling for a single global as requested by the Purge IIV Transactions
 [IBCNE PURGE IIV DATA] option.
  
 IIV routines will automatically disable and enable journaling itself while
 doing the purge. A log of when the IIV Purge is executed will now be kept
 in global ^XTMP("IBCNEKIT" for seven days.
  
  
 3. Removal of Most Popular Payer functionality. Based on a decision from
 the VA Chief Business Office, it was decided that the most popular payer
 function should be removed. Any mention of this functionality should be
 eradicated from the IIV system.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation process will turn off the most popular payer
 functionality and remove all external traces of the most popular payer
 including the previously built Most Popular Payer list.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
        IIV NIGHTLY PROCESS               [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS]
        MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit  [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS]
        Purge IIV Transactions            [IBCNE PURGE IIV DATA]
  
 In addition, the 'IIV EC' HL Logical Link must be stopped using the
 Start/Stop Links [HL START] option prior to performing the install and
 restarted once the installation process has completed.  This is required
 as the routines that perform response processing have been altered in
 this patch.
  
 * NOTE:  If the 'IIV SERVER' HL Logical Link exists, it should be stopped
 and should remain stopped. (IB*2.0*300 patch will delete 'IIV SERVER')
