Subject: ERROR TRAP ON DOCUMENT UPLOAD

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Under certain conditions errors (error trap) can occur on uploads to the 
 file 8925 (TIU Document File).  The problem occurs when the IEN for file 
 8925 is larger than 9999999 and the uploaded document has missing 
 fields.  When the uploaded document has missing fields it is stored in 
 file 8925.4 (TIU UPLOAD LOG).  File 8925.4 has a multiple Missing Fields 
 (8925.42).  Field .02 of the multiple is Record Number.  This is the IEN 
 of the document in file 8925.  The input transform for Record Number is 
 1-9999999.  When the IEN for file 8925 is greater than 9999999 nothing is 
 stored so the following trap occurs.

 REMEDY/NOIS OVERVIEW:

 Problem:
 --------
 Sites are having problems with their uploads. When the upload has an error,
 such as mispelled physician name, the upload alert filer is blowing up.
 The problem occurs when the IEN for file 8925 is larger than 9999999.
 When the uploaded document has missing fields it is stored in file 8925.4
 (TIU UPLOAD LOG).  File 8925.4 has a multiple Missing Fields (8925.42).  
 Field .02 of the multiple is Record Number.  This is the IEN of the
 document in file 8925.  The input transform for Record Number is
 1-9999999.  When the IEN for file 8925 is greater than 9999999 it fails 
 the input transform and does not get stored.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A Data Dictionary change will be made in File 8925.4 (TIU UPLOAD LOG). 
 The Record Number upper range input transform will be increased to 
 accomodate the growing number of TIU records seen at sites. See Technical
 Summary.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 Changed Record Number in the Missing Fields multiple:
 From:
 ^DD(8925.42,.02,0)=RECORD
 NUMBER^NJ7,0^^0;2^K:+X'=X!(X>9999999)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1
 N.N) X
                 3)=Type a Number between 1 and 9999999, 0 Decimal Digits
 ^DD(8925.42,.02,21,0)=^.001^2^2^3050330^^^
 ^DD(8925.42,.02,21,1,0)=This is the internal entry number of the record 
 that was filed with one or
 ^DD(8925.42,.02,21,2,0)=more missing fields.
