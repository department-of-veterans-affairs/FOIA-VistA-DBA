Description:
============

  Routine Fixes
  -------------
  A problem has been found in the supported API for begining the
  standardization process (EN^HDISVCMR).  This problem causes the API to
  error out when it encounters an entry in the file that does not have a
  zero node (i.e. the entry wasn't completely deleted).
  
  A problem has been found in the supported API for obtaining the
  implementation status for a given file (GETSTAT^HDISVF01).  This problem
  causes the API to not yield a complete output when the implementation
  status for a file whose standardization process has not begun is
  requested.
  
  Text problems have been found in the HDIS ERRORS and HDIS XML MSG PROCESS
  ERROR bulletins.  The bulletins themselves are not contained in this
  patch because the text being corrected is generated within the software.
  
  Routine HDISVCMR was also modified to fix an IF/ELSE statement that did
  not work correctly and to replace a reference to the ^DD global with a
  supported FileMan call.
  
  
  Additional VUIDs
  ----------------
  The post installation portion of this patch will store VUIDs
  for the values contained in the following Set of Codes fields
  in the XTID VUID FOR SET OF CODES file (#8985.1):

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch modifies routines used when processing XML formatted MailMan
  messages relayed to/from a centralized system (FORUM).  Although the
  installer is instructed to disable the server options used to process
  these messages, installation of this patch should be done at least one
  day after patch GMRV*5.0*8 has been installed.
  
  This patch can be installed with users on the system with installation
  taking less than 10 minutes.
  
  Note: The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for HDI*1.0*1.
        KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
        without the prior installation of them.

            XT*7.3*93
            GMRV*5.0*8
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.]
  
   2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter HDI*1.0*1):
  
        a.  Backup a Transport Global
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global

      There are no protocols that need to be placed out of order.
   
   8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
