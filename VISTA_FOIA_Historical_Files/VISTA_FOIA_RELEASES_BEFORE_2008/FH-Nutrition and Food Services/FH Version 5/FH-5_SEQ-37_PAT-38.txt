Subject: Laser Label Modifications

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch resolves the following NOIS calls:
    
  SAJ-0902-71284  STANDING ORDERS PRINT ORDER ON TT
  ALB-1002-50484  CUR+1~FHORD7:1 UNDEFINED ERRORS
  UNY-1102-10561  Question on patch FH*5*37
   
 This patch contains the following items:
    
 1) LASER LABEL MODIFICATIONS
 This patch provides functionality to print labels on laser label sheets.
 The existing options which print labels may currently only be printed on 
 track-fed printers/labels.  These seven options are now modified to print
 to laser label sheets as well.  To set up this functionality two new choices 
 have been added to the SIZE OF LABELS field under the LABEL PRINTERS site 
 parameter.  The new sizes are as follows:
   
 2-5/8 x 1  --  Avery 5160 (30 Labels per sheet)
 4 x 1-1/3  --  Avery 5162 (14 Labels per sheet)
   
 Sites may use the Modify Site Parameters [FHSITE] option to set up
 printer(s) to be used with the laser labels.  Example:
    
 Select System Management Option: SP  Modify Site Parameters
   
 Select LABEL PRINTERS: DEV-PORT-80// <- SELECT THE NAME OF A PRINTER
   LABEL PRINTERS: DEV-PORT-80//      <- DEVICE TO SET-UP
   SIZE OF LABELS: ?
      Choose from: 
        1        3-1/2 x 15/16 (Single strip labels)
        2        4 x 1-7/16 (Single strip labels)
        3        2-5/8 x 1 (Laser labels - 30 labels per sheet)
        4        4 x 1-1/3 (Laser labels - 14 labels per sheet)
   SIZE OF LABELS: 3  2-5/8 x 1 (Laser labels - 30 labels per sheet)
 Select LABEL PRINTERS: 
 WILL YOU USE TRAY TICKETS?: YES// 
 HEADING ON BOTTOM OF TICKET?: YES// 
 
 The device/terminal type which is set-up should be 10-Pitch, 80
 Characters per line.  This is one EXAMPLE of a DEVICE and TERMINAL TYPE
 set up for that will work correctly for these labels.  THIS IS ONLY AN
 EXAMPLE:
 
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: DEVICE//
 NAME: HPLASERJET5-LABEL                 $I: _LTA4103:
   ASK DEVICE: YES                       ASK PARAMETERS: YES
   VOLUME SET(CPU): DEV                  QUEUING: ALLOWED
   LOCATION OF TERMINAL: DEVELOPMENT     SUBTYPE: P-HPLASER-P10-LBL
   TYPE: TERMINAL
 
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: TERMINAL TYPE//
 NAME: P-HPLASER-P10-LBL                 SELECTABLE AT SIGN-ON: NO
   RIGHT MARGIN: 80                      FORM FEED: #
   PAGE LENGTH: 62                       BACK SPACE: $C(8)
   OPEN EXECUTE: W *27,"&l0z0u0o0E",*27,"(8U",*27,"(s0p10h0s3b4099T",*27,"&l8.0C"
   CLOSE EXECUTE: W *27,"&10z0U" U IO K IO(1,IO) S IO=$ZIO C IO S QUE="/QUEUE="_$
 P(ION,"-",2)_"/DELETE",QUE=$ZC(%PRINT,IO,QUE)
   DESCRIPTION: HP Laserjet 5P Label Printer
  OPEN EXECUTE DESCRIPTION:   Used to print out Dietetics Labels on Avery
  5160/8160 sheets.
   
 The list of label printing options modified for this functionality is
 as follows:
   
    DA     Diet Activity Report/Labels [FHORD13]
    DR     Reprint Diet Labels [FHORD14]
    EL     List Early/Late Trays [FHOREL1]
    LA     Run SF Labels/Consolid Ingred List [FHNO2]
    SL     Print Standing Order Labels [FHSP8]
    TL     Print Tubefeeding Labels [FHORTFM]
    WP     Print Bulk Feedings/Cost Report [FHNO10]
   
 When label printing options are used the printer(s) set up for laser
 labels in the Modify Site Parameters option can be selected at the
 "Select LABEL Printer: HOME//" prompt.  An EXAMPLE:
   
 Select Dietetic Lists/Reports Option: DR  Reprint Diet Labels
   
            R E P R I N T   D I E T   L A B E L S
   
 Reprint by COMMUNICATION OFFICE, PATIENT, or WARD? PATIENT// C
                                                              =
 Select COMMUNICATION OFFICE:  HINES COMM OFFICE  
                               =================
   
 Select LABEL Printer: HOME// DEV-PORT-80  <-THE NAME OF THE PRINTER WHICH
                              ===========  <-HAS BEEN SET UP.
   
   
 2) NOIS SAJ-0902-71284  STANDING ORDERS PRINT ORDER ON TT
 In the Print Tray Tickets [FHMTKP] option the Standing Orders previously 
 displayed in the order in which they were entered.  This patch will modify 
 the Print Tray Tickets option so that Standing Orders are displayed in 
 alphabetical order.
   
    
 3) NOIS ALB-1002-50484  CUR+1~FHORD7:1 UNDEFINED ERRORS
 In the Order Diet [FHORD1] option if a patient who is not currently an 
 inpatient is selected an undefined variable error would occur.  This is 
 fixed.  Now if a patient who is not currently an inpatient is selected a 
 message stating "NOT CURRENTLY AN INPATIENT" will appear and then the 
 option will be exited.
   
    
 4) EXPAND FREE TEXT FIELDS IN THE DIETETICS PATIENT FILE
 This patch will expand two fields under the ADMISSION (#1) multiple field
 in the Dietetics Patient (#115) file from 80 characters to 160 characters.
 The fields expanded are:
   
 COMMENT (#4) subfield of the TUBEFEEDING (#40) multiple
 ORDER (#2) subfield of the ADDITIONAL ORDERS (#85) multiple
   
 NOTE:
 **************************************************************************
 "To make this field greater than 160 characters would mean creating a new 
 field, requiring involved changes to the FH Tubefeeding and Additional 
 Orders options.  Modifications to expand the field length to greater than 
 160 characters will be included in a future Nutrition & Food Service patch".
 **************************************************************************  
   
      
 5) NOIS UNY-1102-10561  Question on patch FH*5*37
 In Dietetics Patch 37, functionality was added to display the diet
 pattern in parentheses on any "No Diet Pattern" messages in the List
 Patient Events [FHORX2] and Diet Activity Report/Labels [FHORD13] options.  
 However, diet orders placed through CPRS which did not have a diet pattern
 would not display the diet pattern in parentheses in these options.  This
 patch will add that functionality for orders placed through CPRS as well.
