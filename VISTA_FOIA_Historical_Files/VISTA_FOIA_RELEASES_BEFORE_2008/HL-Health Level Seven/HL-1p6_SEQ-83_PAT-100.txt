 NOIS calls(s): MAR-0802-21383
  
 Some sites have experienced an undefined error at DELETE+16^HLCSQUE1:1.  
 The undefined variable is HLX.  The error occurs while a hybrid lower 
 level protocol background process is $ORDERing through the IN QUEUE 
 multiple (#870.019) of the HL Logical Link file (#870.)
  
 Routine Summary:
  
 The first and second lines of the HLCSQUE1 routine included in this

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
    NOTICE:  Do not proceed unless patches HL*1.6*59 has been installed.
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  Install the KIDS build onto your system as follows:
  
        - Using Mailman, read the KIDS build message.
        - At the 'Enter message action' prompt, enter 'INSTALL/CHECK
          MESSAGE' and press RETURN.
        - At the 'OK to continue with Load?' prompt enter 'YES' and press
          RETURN.
        - You will be asked 'Want to continue with Load?' immediately
          before installation begins.  If you want to continue, enter 'YES'
          and press RETURN.  If you wish to stop, enter 'NO' and press
          RETURN.
    
    3.  Check the integrity of the just loaded build, and compare this
        build to the software on your system.  You will need to use the
        following options (which are all on the 'Installation [XPD 
        INSTALLATION MENU]' menu option):
  
         - VERIFY CHECKSUMS IN TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routine(s) that are in the
           transport global using calculated checksums for every routine.
           If the transport global checksums are incorrect, do not 
           continue with installation, and contact the patch developer
           for a new patch.  If the checksums are correct, continue to 
           the next step.
   
         - BACKUP A TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
         - COMPARE TRANSPORT GLOBAL TO CURRENT SYSTEM - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch,
           including routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.
   
         - PRINT TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
        If all the above steps have been done, continue to the following
        steps.
  
    4.  AXP/DSM SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If the
        routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    5.  Stop all background processes (logical links and incoming
        and outgoing filers) using the 'Filer and Link Management
        Option's 'Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]'
        menu option.
  
    6.  Stop the link manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
        [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
  
    7.  AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this
        installation.
  
    8.  The patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. This is done using the 'Installation' menu's 'Install
        Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD]' menu option. When using this
        menu option to install the patch build, you will be asked
        several questions.  The questions, and the answers you should
        supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*100>
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
  
    9.  Start all background processes (logical links and incoming
        and outgoing filers) using the Filer and Link Management
        Option's 'Restart/Start All Links and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]'
        menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
   10. AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: If you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
       for this installation, you may enable it now.
  
   11.  AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: After the patch has been installed, rebuild
        your map set, if necessary.
  
   12.  Start the link manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
        [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option.
