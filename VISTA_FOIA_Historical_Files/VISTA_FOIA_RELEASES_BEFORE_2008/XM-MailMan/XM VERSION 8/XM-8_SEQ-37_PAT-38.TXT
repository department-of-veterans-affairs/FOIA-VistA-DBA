 Problem:
 --------
 Messages being produced out of AUSTIN (PAID or otherwise) are being 
 affixed with a message number that has been used at some time in the 
 past.  These message numbers, upon arrival at the site, are evaluated by
 the Mailman application for duplication. If that message number continues
 to exist in the AI xref of the MESSAGE (#3.9) file, the site's Mailman
 will consider it a duplicate message, deliver the old message to the
 appropriate server, and consequently not deliver the appropriate new
 message.  Also, the appropriate server will not be able to process the old
 message since it will, most likely, not be the correct type of message and
 thus will assume and report that the message number was not received. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 It is highly recommended that each site immediately initiate the 
 following two processes.  First, schedule the XMAUTOPURGE option to run
 automatically, once per day, using Taskmanager.  Second, interactively 
 run, (do not schedule), the AI x-Ref Purge, [XMMGR-PURGE=SI=XREF], to run
 at least once per year.
  
 The following steps will assist you in scheduling the XMAUTOPURGE:
  
   1.  Using Taskman Management, go into Schedule/Unschedule Options.
  
   2.  At the "Select OPTION to schedule or reschedule:" prompt, enter
       <XMAUTOPURGE> and press <Enter>.
  
   3.  A screen will appear with several options.  In the "QUEUED TO RUN 
       AT WHAT TIME:" option, enter the day and time you would like the 
       process to run.  We suggest you start it as soon as possible and 
       choose a time late in the evening like 2300.  An example would be 
       to enter the following: <T@23:00>.  This entry would start the 
       process today at 11:00pm.
  
   4.  At the "RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY:" prompt, to set up daily at 
       11:00pm for example, enter "D@23:00"
  
   5.  Exit the screen after saving this scheduled process.
  
 The following steps will assist you with interactively running the AI 
 X-Reference purge which is suggested to be run at least once per year.
   
   1.  From the programmers prompt, enter <D ^XUP> and press <Enter>
  
   2.  From the "Select OPTION NAME:" enter "XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF" and 
       press <Enter>.
   
   3.  From the "Kill all XMBX 'AI' nodes older than:  <date>//" 
       press <Enter> which accepts the default date which should be two
       years prior to the current date that you are running the process.
    
   4.  The process will run immediately after pressing <Enter> and upon
       completion will give you a total count of the nodes reviewed, the 
       number of deleted nodes and the number of remaining nodes.
