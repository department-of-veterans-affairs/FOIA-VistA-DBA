Subject: USERS CANNOT DISPOSITION DECEASED PATIENTS FROM THE WAIT LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix two issues and reverse a change that was introduced
 with patch SD*5.3*424. 
 1. Users cannot disposition deceased patients from the Wait List when
    using the Disposition Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Entry 
    [SD WAIT LIST DISPOSITION ENTRY] option.  .
 2. Using Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT] 
    option or WE Wait List Entry option in Appointment Management[SDAM 
    APPT MGT] an invalid date is stuffed into the DESIRED DATE OF
    APPOINTMENT(#22) field in the SD WAIT LIST file(#409.3) when placing a
    patient on the Wait List, selecting priority of future and making a
    null entry at the Desired Date of Appointment prompt.
 3. Adding back logic to allow users to enter past dates at the Desired
    Date of Appointment prompt, which had been removed with patch
    SD*5.3*424.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD98012 -  Users cannot disposition deceased patients from wait list
     duplicate - HD102750 - Death entries put in before disposition
                 HD107920 - Wait List - Date of Death
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When using the Disposition Wait List(Sch/PCMM) Entry [SD WAIT LIST 
     DISPOSITION ENTRY]option users cannot disposition deceased patients.
     They are presented with the message: "PATIENT'S DATE OF DEATH HAS 
     BEEN RECORDED" and then are prompted to enter another patient name.
     This problem does not occur when using the WD Wait List Disposition
     option in Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT].
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine SDWLDISP so that the user is still presented with the
     message indicated above, but allowed to disposition the patient.  
     Routine SDWLD will also be modified so that the above message does not
     scroll off the screen.
  
 2)  HD107760 - Allowing <CR> at desired date - stuffs date of '1699'
     duplicate - HD108500 - Invalid date entry accepted
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user places a patient on the Wait List, selects Priority of
     Future and makes a null entry at the Desired Date of Appointment
     prompt an invalid date is stuffed into the DESIRED DATE OF 
     APPOINTMENT(#22) field in the SD WAIT LIST(#409.3) file.
     This problem occurs using both the Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM)
     [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT] option and the WE Wait List Entry option in
     Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT].
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDWLE110 will be modified so that the user is forced to
     either enter a valid future date or change the priority to ASAP.
  
 3)  HD94355  - Can no longer enter past dates with SD*5.3*424
     duplicate - HD96406 - Unable to input past date
                 HD97394 - Problem after SD*5.3*424
                 HD111702 - Modify code to allow past date to be entered
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Remedy ticket HD0000000063702 requested that past dates not be allowed
     when entering a Desired Date of Appointment when placing a patient on
     the Electronic Wait List, which generated patch SD*5.3*424.  The
     PCMM/EWL work group has decided that this capability needs to be
     available to users and has requested that the changes made with patch
     SD424 be changed back.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     The logic changes made in patch SD*5.3*424 that removed the ability to
     enter past dates will be reverted back so that past dates can once
     again be entered at the Desired Date of Appointment prompt.
