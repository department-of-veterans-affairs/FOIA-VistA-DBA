Subject: Q4 - ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch checks for the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR field (#.121) of the
 PATIENT file (#2) being set or for the patient having a foreign address
 when queueing transactions to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
 (CMOP). If found, the fill stays on suspense for CMOP, but only prints the
 reject MailMan message the first time for the fill. The reject MailMan
 message is sent to holders of the PSXMAIL key and the person who queued
 the CMOP transmission. An entry is made into the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) 
 activity log the first time the fill cannot be transmitted due to one of 
 these two conditions.
  
 This patch corrects the numbering of refills in the RX REFERENCE field 
 (#.04) of the ACTIVITY LOG multiple (#52.3) of the PRESCRIPTION file
 (#52). A number 6 in the field should mean a partial and any refills 
 greater than the 5th refill should be stored as 1 plus the actual refill 
 number. 
  
 This patch also removes a call to a routine that is not used (related to 
 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 6.0 sending information to the CLINICAL INFO
 RESOURCE NETWORK (CIRN) package). Outpatient Pharmacy will be removed as a
 subscriber to Data Base Integration Agreement (DBIA) 2382.
