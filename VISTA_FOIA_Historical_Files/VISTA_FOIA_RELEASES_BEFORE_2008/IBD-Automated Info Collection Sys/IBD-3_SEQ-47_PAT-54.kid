Enter a picture clause specific to Paper Keyboard.  A picture clause

describes the intended format for the data type.  This is similar to

an M pattern match.  For example, a CPT code is 5 characters, the
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.02,21,4,0)
first character may be an alpha or numeric followed by 4 numeric
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.02,21,5,0)

When using print formats for paper keyboard you should enter the 
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.04,21,2,0)
picture clause in this field.  For example, the print format for
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.04,21,3,0)
a SSN might look like ___-__-____.  This would cause the dashes to
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.04,21,4,0)
be printed and user input to be accepted in three subfields with
"^DD",358.99,358.99,10.04,21,5,0)
lenghts of 3, 2, and 4 numerics.  You would then enter the picture

in this field as ###-##-####.  (note the # sign is used as the

This file contains a description of all of the interfaces with other packages.

The form will invoke the proper interface routines by doing a lookup on
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",7,0)
this file and then invoking the routine by indirection. The INPUT VARIABLE
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",8,0)
fields are for documentation purposes and to verify that the proper
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",9,0)
variables are defined. Data will be exchanged between the encounter form
"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",10,0)
utilities and other packages by putting the data in a predefined location.

"^DIC",358.6,358.6,"%D",15,0)

these items of data can have its own entry in the Package Interface file,
