Description:
============

  
   ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
   executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately 
   after the KIDS install for the Patch to function. 
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
  
  
 This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration 
 (BCMA) Health Systems Committee (HSC) Phase III project.  The main
 function of PSB*3*32 is to provide the BCMA user with additional BCMA
 Coversheet and reporting support.
  
  
 1.  Problem:  PSI-06-029/HD0000000126326
     Processing the BCMA Missed Medications Report causes the client to 
     "time-out" when the report is to display within the BCMA GUI 
     Application and prior to sending the report to a printer.
  
     Corrective Action:
     Make the Missed Medications Report process faster so the client 
     does not "time-out".
  
  
 2.  Problem:  PSI-06-019/HD0000000130671
     There is difficulty determining the application of a medical patch 
     that has not been marked as REMOVED when that order has expired or 
     discontinued.
  
     Corrective Action:
     Allow the user to view and act on patches for expired or discontinued 
     orders when the patient's BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) first opens.
  
  
 3.  Problem:  PSI-06-056/HD0000000131075
     Issues related to extra Pro Re Nata (PRN) doses of medication 
     ordered as QDPRN or BIDPRN and reports of nurses missing the last 
     administration time, have cause patient safety concerns. 
  
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA PRN administration dialog box will be enhanced to provide the
     following features for all PRN administrations:  Icon, Schedule, Last
     Given and Reminder checkbox and statement.
  
  
 4.  Problem:  PSI-06-014/HD0000000128909
     Administration problems have been caused when Med Route abbreviations
     on the VDL have been confused.
  
     Corrective Action:
     Display the expanded version of the Med Route.
  
  
 5.  Problem:  PSI-06-060/HD0000000143603
     Due to a limitation in the Delphi application, there is a 255-pixel
     limit on the row height in the BCMA GUI VDL that results in truncation
     of an order when there are a large number of additives/solutions on
     the order.
  
     Corrective Action:
     Adjust display area of medications on the VDL to compensate for orders
     with a large number of items to display.
  
  
 6.  Enhancement:  New Coversheet Overview Reports.
     As a part of the BCMA HSC Phase III, patch PSB*3.0*32 and 
     PSB.3.0.32 GUI will provide BCMA users with reports that display 
     Coversheet Overview data.  There is a new Coversheet Report for each 
     Coversheet Overview.
  
  
 7.  Enhancement:  Global Report Enhancements.
     Various enhancements have been made to BCMA reports in general.  These
     enhancements are presented in BCMA HSC Phase III documentation.
  
  
 8.  Enhancement:  Coversheet and Other Miscellaneous Enhancements.
     A variety of new Coversheet and miscellaneous feature will be 
     supported with the installation of this patch.  The BCMA HSC Phase 
     III documentation provides details of these new features.  In support 
     of BCMA enhancements, the CRITERIA field (#.61) of the BCMA REPORT 
     REQUEST file (#53.69) and the sub-file INPUT LIST (#53.692) of the 
     BCMA REPORT REQUEST file (#53.69) have been added.
