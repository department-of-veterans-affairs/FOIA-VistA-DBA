Subject: Fix Alert related undefine in ORBSTAT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Print Template

Description: 
============

  
   
  The routine ORBSTAT was transported as a part of Kernel 8.0 to insure that
  the alert statistics would perform correctly with the movement of alert
  data from file 200 to file 8992.  Unfortunately, a couple of references to
  file 200 were not converted, resulting in no output for the total alert
  count.  This patch includes correction of these references within the
  routine and a print template for file 8992 which is used by this routine.
   
  ========================================================================= 
  Installation:
   
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.
   2. Answer NO to the question:
      'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'
   3. From the 'Installion Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
      'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
      have the correct checksum.
   4. Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      user are on the system and the posibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
   5. Do ^XPDKRN and run the option 'INSTALL PACKAGE(S)'.
      Select the package 'XU*8.0*7' and proceed with install. 
   6. Enable user's login if inhibited.
