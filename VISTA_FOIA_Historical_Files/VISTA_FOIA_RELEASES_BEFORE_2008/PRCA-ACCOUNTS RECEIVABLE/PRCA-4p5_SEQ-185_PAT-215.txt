Description:
============

 **************************** NOTE ************************************
 * CoreFLS sites must coordinate the installation this patch with the *
 * AR-CoreFLS development team.                                       *
 **********************************************************************
  
 The Finance Office reported an issue found in the AR Bad Debt Report. The 
 report was printing zero amounts in the LTC (Long Term Care) section of
 the report since October 1, 2003. This patch corrects this issue.
  
 This patch also corrects the help message displayed prior to printing the
 Bad Debt Report. The updated screen message is:
  
 "This option will print the Bad Debt Report.  This report is automatically
 generated on the day after the EOAM.  The estimated value can be locally
 changed on the first workday after the EOAM. On the next to last workday
 of the month, the report is transmitted to FMS."
  
 This patch also corrects the issue with negative Write-Offs amounts in 
 the Bad Debt Report calculation reported by some sites after the patch 
 PRCA*4.5*193 was installed. The patch PRCA*4.5*193 modified the logic of 
 Write-Offs calculations by subtracting re-establish amounts from 
 Write-Off totals. This patch discarded the above code change implemented 
 by PRCA*4.5*193 in regards to Write-Off calculation.
  
 Please be aware that the amount reported in the Bad Debt Write-Off (Plus)
 line in the Bad Debt Report (BDR) may not match what is reported in the
 FMS, WRITEOFFS/CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS (WR) DOCUMENT portion of the AR Data
 Collector.  The amount reported by the AR Data Collector represents the
 amount for only the current month.  The amount on the Bad Debt Report is a
 historical figure that represents many months.  Due to the way write-offs
 and re-establish transactions may be utilized, these amounts may differ.  
 After the patch is loaded stations should be able to take the Write-Off
 (WR) amount from the current Bad Debt Report and add it to the previous
 month's BDR Write-Off (Plus) amount, and this should equal the Bad Debt
 Write-Off (Plus) amount for the current month.  If there is a difference
 between these 2 numbers, it should be equal to the WR-04 amount for 3rd
 party bills.

 Problem/Resolution overview
 ----------------------------
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Bad Debt Report does not print correct amounts for the Long Term Care
 section (Fund 4032). All amounts related to Fund 4032 incorrectly printed
 as zero. All other sections of the Bad Debt Report printed correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The problem is related to the cancellation of the HSIF in the report. The
 section printing comparison percentage charts for HSIF and LTC was
 disabled on 10/01/03. However, calculation of LTC amounts was being done
 within that block. Therefore, LTC amounts stopped calculating after
 10/01/03. This patch enables the code calculating LTC amount for the
 report. This patch also removes the date-sensitive code related to HSIF
 and SGL 1319.1 from the routine RCRJRBDR.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some sites reported incorrect (negative) Write-off amounts on the Bad 
 Debt Report after the patch PRCA*4.5*193 was installed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch PRCA*4.5*193 modified the logic of Write-Offs calculations by 
 subtracting re-establish amounts from Write-Off totals. This patch 
 discarded the above code change implemented by PRCA*4.5*193 in regards to 
 Write-Off calculation.
