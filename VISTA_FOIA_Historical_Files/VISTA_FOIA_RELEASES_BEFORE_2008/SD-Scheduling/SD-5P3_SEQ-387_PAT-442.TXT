Subject: UPDATE D00 & D000 ERROR MESSAGE TEXT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will modify the text description for error codes D00 and
 D000.  This patch will also fix the Vista side validation logic so
 that it checks if a Person Class has been inactivated and, if applicable,
 flag the encounter for Vista error D000.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1) HD134702  Modify D000 error message
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was requested that the text description for error codes D00 and
    D000 be changed, as follows:
  
    From:  Provider Type Code is missing or invalid.
    To:    Provider Type Code is missing, invalid or inactive.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-init routine SC442PST was created to make this change. 
  
  
 2) HD134182  D00 Errors
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The existing Vista validation logic does not check if the provider's
    Person Class has been inactivated in the Person Class file (8932.1) and
    allows such encounters to be transmitted via the Ambulatory Care
    Nightly Transmission, which are consequently rejected by Austin (AAC)  
    for error code D00 - Provider Type Code is missing or invalid.  
    Note: this text description is also being updated as part of this patch
    (see Remedy ticket HD134702).
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    The Vista validation logic in routine SCMSVUT1 will be modified to
    check if the provider's Person Class has been inactivated in the
    Person Class file (8932.1).  When this occurs, the encounter will now
    fail the validation check and be flagged for Vista error code D000 -
    Provider Type Code is missing, invalid or inactive.
