                            XU*8*87
  
       Patch XU*8*46 should be installed before this one.
  
       This patch contains two new fields to the Option File
  XQUIT MESSAGE and XQUIT EXECUTABLE that were inadvertently
  left out of Patch XU*8*46.  The documentation for using
  these fields is found in the option Kernel New Features.
       This patch also contains a single routine that fixes
  a bug that went out with that patch.  Dayton discovered
  that XQUIT processing did not work with queued options.
  Frankly, it never occurred to me that XQUIT would be 
  used in that manner.  They were publishing a report that
  they did not want on holidays, so they set the XQUIT 
  variable in the Entry Action if it was a holiday.
    
       Checksums were obtained using CHECK^XTSUMBLD.

  Installation Instructions:
    
  1.  Users are allowed on the system, and this patch may be queued.
  
  2.  This routine is not usually mapped, so you shouldn't have to
      disable mapping.
    
  3.  Use the "Install/Check Message" option on the PackMan menu to 
      load the package.
    
  4.  On the KIDS menu use the following options:
    
       Veryify Checksums in Transport Global
       Print Transport Global (Optional)
       Compare Trasport Global to Current System
       Backup transport Global
    
  5.  MSM sites answer 'YES' to the question: "Want to MOVE routines 
      to other CPUs?"   AXP sites answer 'NO'.
    
  6.  Rebuild mapped set if necessary.
