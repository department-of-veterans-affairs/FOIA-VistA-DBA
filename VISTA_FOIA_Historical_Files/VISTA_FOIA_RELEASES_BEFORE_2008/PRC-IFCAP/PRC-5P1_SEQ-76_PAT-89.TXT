 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 HD55259    OIS-1101-N1485  error in PRCHRPTA
     
    Problem:
    -------- 
    When running the Public Law 100-322 Report [PRCHOUT P.L. 100-322], a
    NULL SUBSCRIPT error will occur if there are no records to report for
    the selected Station Number.

    The report has been modified to verify that there are records to be

    no records were available.
