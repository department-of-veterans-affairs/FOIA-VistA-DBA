Subject: IV Stop date Issues

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 HD000000104291 - Stop Date calculation can be in the Past
 Potential PSI - PSI-05-069
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following applies to IV orders where Solution is a 'starred' field. 
 When editing the Additive or Solution of a previously renewed active IV order, 
 the stop date/time can erroneously be re-calculated to a date in the past. 
 This will cause the order to be expired immediately upon verification. During 
 testing of this issue, it was discovered that the problem existed during the 
 edit of any active IV order.
  
 The solution involves two changes. The first is to modify the Stop Date/Time 
 calculation to use the "Last Renewed" date as a starting point.  The Stop 
 Date/Time calculation occurring during Additive and Solution edits will now 
 be consistent with edits to other 'starred' fields.
  
 Second, it is still possible for a stop date to be calculated in the past. 
 If this occurs, the Pharmacist will be asked if they still wish to continue.  
 If they continue, the order will automatically expire immediately upon 
 verification.  If they select to not continue, they may go back to the profile 
 and edit the Stop Date/Time.
