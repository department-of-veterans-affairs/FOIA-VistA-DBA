Description: 
============

  
  
  PATCH DESCRIPTION:   
    
  If you are not an integrating site, installation of this patch will not affect
  Library package functionality or have any impact on your data files.  For
  integrating sites, this patch merges data from substations' Library files into
  the primary station's Library files.  The temporary global, XTMP("LBRY" must 
  have been imported into the primary station's database prior to installation
 of this patch.  XTMP("LBRY" is the temporary file containing the Library data
 from  all integrating substations.  
    
  There is a detailed Installation Guide/Release Notes manual on the Hines 
  SOFTWARE.ANONYMOUS directory (address 152.129.1.110) named LBR2_3.DOC in MS 
  Word Version 6.0 format.  You may obtain it by ftp.  Please print the manual 
  and keep the Installation Guide portion for the IRM staff and give the
 Release  Notes portion of the manual to the Chief, Library Service.  
   
  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PRINT AND READ THIS DETAILED INSTALLATION
  GUIDE/RELEASE NOTES AS THERE ARE STEPS THAT IRM SHOULD PERFORM PRIOR TO 
  INSTALLATION.
   
  **IMPORTANT**   PATCHES 2 & 3 ARE DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER.  YOU SHOULD 
  EXPECT TO INSTALL THESE ONE AFTER THE OTHER.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
  ===================================================
    
  Installation time for non-integrating sites should be less than 5 minutes.  
     
  Installation time for integrating sites is directly affected by the number of
  integrating sites (if more than one) and the number of records in File #682.  
   
  1.      Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed 
          above in the Routine Summary if they are included in your mapped 
          routine set.  
      
  2.      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke 
          the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  Answer 
          YES to the question Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
          separate back-up message ? 
      
  3.      From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
          select the Installation menu.  
     
  4.      Use the option Verify Checksums in Transport Global to verify 
          that all routines have the correct checksum values.  
     
  5.      If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
          patch prior to installation, you should use the Backup a 
          Transport Global option at this time.  You may also compare 
          the routine in your production account to the routine in the 
          patch by using the Compare a Transport Global to Current 
          System.  
      
  6.      Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package, 
          LBR*2.5*3.  When prompted Want to DISABLE Scheduled

  7.      MSM sites:  You should respond YES to Want to MOVE 
          routines to other CPUs? and specify CPUs.  Alternately, 
          you may move the routines to your other systems after KIDS 
          has finished the installation.
