Description: 
============

     *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new GUI.
         Installation of this GUI is required in order to see the full
         functionality of this patch. ***
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
 
 1.  Problem:  Any order displayed as Provider Hold on the GUI Virtual 
     Due List (VDL) is also marked as "Refused" when multiple medication 
     orders are marked as "Refused."
 
     Corrective Action:  The GUI VDL will not apply the status of "Refused" 
     to medication orders placed on Provider Hold when marking multiple
     medication orders. 
 
 2.  Problem:  Comments entered when a ward stock IV bag is completed 
     and another ward stock IV bag begins infusing, are carried from one IV
     bag to another. 
 
     Corrective Action:  Comments entered for an IV bag will not carry over 
     to the next IV bag.
 
 3.  Problem:  The error message "Missing Data" sporadically displays on 
     the VDL when a user tries to administer a medication via the "CPRS Med 
     Order" button.
 
     Corrective Action:  The "Missing Data" message has been corrected.
  
 4.  Problem:  The error message, "'.' Not a valid integer" sporadically 
     displays when a user accesses a patient record on the VDL.
 
     Corrective Action:  The VDL has been corrected to not generate the 
     error message.
 
 5.  Problem:  A medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" marked 
     as "Given" using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] 
     option, does not display on the VDL as "Given."
 
     Corrective Action:  Medication orders with a dosage form of "PATCH" 
     marked as "Given" using the Manual Medication Entry 
     [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, will display on the VDL as "Given.
 
 6.  Problem:  The "Provider:" field on the "Order Manager" dialog 
     screen does not display all valid Providers when performing a partial 
     lookup. This was a result of BCMA not validating the inactive date 
     correctly.
 
     Corrective Action:  The code has been modified to perform the validation
     on the inactive and termination date. The correct Providers will 
     display for selection under the "Provider:" field on the "Order Manager" 
     dialog screen. 
 
 7.  Problem:  Drugs with a future inactive date were not available for 
     printing on labels using the Label Print [PSBO BL] option.
 
     Corrective Action:  Drugs with future inactive dates are now available 
     for printing on labels.
 
 8.  Problem:  BCMA does not perform a version check between the GUI 
     application and CHUI application side.
 
     Corrective Action:  BCMA will validate the version of the GUI application 
     running on the GUI against the CHUI application.  The client version must 
     match the patch number on the VistA server, and if compatible, the previous 
     GUI version will be allowed to run.  No prior version will be allowed to 
     run on the client.
 
 9.  Problem:  The current "Typical" installation process for the BCMA 
     GUI application installs both the BCMA client and the BCMA Site Parameter 
     application. This is not appropriate for an installation on a ward P.C.
     
     Corrective Action:  The "Typical" installation process has been modified
     to only install the BCMA client. 
 
 10. Problem:  The action of marking multiple medications, as "Held" or    
     "Refused" does not always apply to every medication on the VDL. For 
     example, if a medication is already marked as "Given", the action of "Held" 
     or "Refused" will not apply to that medication order.
 
     Corrective Action:  If multiple medications are highlighted on the VDL, 
     and the action of "Held" or "Refused" does not apply to a highlighted 
     order, an Informational dialog box will display with the message,
     "Held or Refused will NOT be applied to the following order(s):" with
      a list of orders.
 
 11. Problem:  The message "ERROR: MISSING DATA - ALL FIELDS ARE 
     REQUIRED," Missing Field: NEEDED BY DATE/TIME," displays when a user 
     selects the Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE FOLLOWUP] option, to 
     complete and save a request.
 
     Corrective Action:  The "Date@Time Needed" field on the "Missing Dose 
     Request" dialog box is now a required field.
 
 12. Problem:  The Right-Click feature used to access the "Take Action 
     on WS" command was not available for a ward stock IV bag marked as
     "Held" on the VDL.
 
     Corrective Action:  The Right-Click feature used to access the "Take 
     Action on WS" command is now available for a ward stock IV bag marked as
     "Held" on the VDL.
 
 13. Problem:  When users sign on to the BCMA GUI application, and are 
     prompted to scan the patient's wristband, a lower portion of the screen 
     display is grayed out.
 
     Corrective Action:  The GUI screen display has been corrected.
 
 14. Problem:  Reports would not print from the GUI application when 
     print devices had the same name.
 
     Corrective Action:  The GUI printing function has been modified to print 
     reports to devices that have the same name.
 
 15. Problem:  A medication order with a schedule of "AC&HS," displays 
     on the BCMA VDL with a schedule of "ACHS."
 
     Corrective Action:  The GUI has been modified to properly display the 
     schedule.
 
 16. Problem:  The shortcut keys of "ALT+A" used to display "Allergies" 
     would go to the "Start Time:" field of the "Virtual Due List Parameters:" 
     section of the VDL.
 
     Corrective Action:  The shortcut key for "Allergies" has been changed
     to ALT-G.
 
 17. Problem:  If a medication order is created or edited using the 
     Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option or the Edit 
     Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option, the last action would display 
     incorrectly on the "Last Action" column of the VDL by dropping off any 
     trailing zero of the time from the date/time format.
 
     Corrective Action:  The last action for a medication order will now 
     display correctly under the "Last Action" column on the VDL. 
 
 18. Problem:  Users who mark a PRN medication order, with the dosage 
     form of "PATCH" as "Given," cannot document a PRN effectiveness using 
     the Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT] option.
 
     Corrective Action:  Users can now document a PRN effectiveness for a 
     "Given" PRN medication order with a dosage form of "PATCH."
 
 19. Problem:  Under the IV Medication Tab, if a medication order gets  
     discontinued when a ward stock IV bag has a status of "Stopped," no data 
     would display under the "IV Bag Chronology."
 
     Corrective Action:  Data will correctly display under the "IV Bag 
     Chronology" display area when an IV order becomes discontinued and a ward 
     stock IV bag has status of "Stopped" status.
 
 20. Problem:  The Special Instructions pop-up box does not function on 
     the IV Medication Tab when the Pharmacist enters an exclamation ("!") to 
     copy and flag the Provider comments for display in a BCMA message 
     dialogue box.
 
     Corrective Action:  The Special Instructions pop-up box will now display 
     on the IV Medication Tab when a Pharmacist finishes an IV order and uses 
     the "!" key to copy and flag the Provider comments for display on the
     BCMA VDL.
 
 21. Problem:  The "ALLERGIES:" bar on the VDL displays "No allergies on 
     file" when no assessment was completed.
 
     Corrective Action:  The "ALLERGIES:" bar will now display  "no allergy 
     assessment" if there are no allergies assessed and "no known allergies"
     if there is an allergy assessed, but no allergies.
 
 22. Problem: When the site places an IV order on the CPRS med order button 
     that has a solution and inactive additive, it displays the message    
     "Incomplete data returned from Vista".
 
     Correction: The code has been modified to validate an inactive additive 
     and solution correctly and send complete data.
