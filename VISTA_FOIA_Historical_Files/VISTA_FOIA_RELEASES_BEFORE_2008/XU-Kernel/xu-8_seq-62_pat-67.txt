Subject: Protect active and persistent tasks

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 **** This patch will add to the number of entries in the LOCK table. ****
 **** Depending on the number of jobs on a system node the Lock table ****
 **** may need to be increased.                                       ****
 
 Certain long running task (i.e. HL7 filers and LLP's) are getting removed from
 the system by the daily 'job' and 'Taskman' clean-up routines even though they
 are still active.  Taskman has been modified to lock the
 ^%ZTSCH("TASK",tasknumber) node when starting a task and release the lock at
 completion.  The clean-up routines will now attempt to lock this node to
 determine if the task is still active.
   
 These problems were reported in the following NOIS's:  MAR-1196-20400, 
 CMO-1196-41389, WNY-1296-11772, MAD-0197-40149, ISH-0197-41376, 
 HIN-0297-41185.
   
 In addition to being tested locally, the following sites tested this patch:
   
  Baltimore VAMC, Dayton VAMC, Columbia VAMC
   
 WNY-1296-11772, CMO-1196-41389, MAR-1196-20400
 HIN-0297-41185 ZTMS3   Prevent TaskMan and Kernel clean-up programs from 
 ISH-0197-41376          blowing away tasks that need to run for long 
 periods
                         of time.  This requires that tasks only use 
                         INCREMENTAL locks.

 Long time requests for tasks to restart them self's if they stop unexpectedly.
 Part of the problem has been to know when a TASK is running.  The change to
 prevent clean-up programs from deleting the info about long running tasks puts
 into place the needed part so that taskman can check and restart tasks that 
 need to be persistent.
 
 SFC-1197-60720  ZTMS2  Taskman would not check the device file OUT-OF-SERVICE
                 ZTMS3  field.  This was caused by DT not being set at the
                 ZTMS   time of the call to %ZIS.
 
 ZTLOAD has two new supported tags.
 
 $$PSET^%ZTLOAD to set a task as persistent.  Returns 1 if the flag is set 
                otherwise returns 0.
                
 PCLEAR^%ZTLOAD to clear the persistent flag for a task.

 ========================================================================= 
 Installation:
 
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
       
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
       
          Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          
  4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
       user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
       acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
       Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
       
   5.  Use 'D ^XPDKRN', and the INSTALL PACKAGE(S) option:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*67'
                               =========
          
   7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
       other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
       MSM Sites - With Taskman not working you need to move the routine to
       other CPU's with the D ^XPDCPU
       
   8.  After installing this patch, 
       DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
       your production account to each manager account:
       OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
       ZTLOAD
       ZTLOAD2
       ZTLOAD3
       ZTLOAD7
       ZTM
       ZTM0
       ZTMS
       ZTMS2
       ZTMS3
 
       And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
        
       All sites:
       DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
       Select the System
       Patch number to load: 67
                             ==
        
   9.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
  10.  Enable user's login.
       Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.
