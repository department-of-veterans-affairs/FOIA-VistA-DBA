Subject: MPI REMOTE QUERY FOR STATISTICS REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems
  to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating
  Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*25, RG*1.0*31, and RG*1.0*37 are required builds for patch
  RG*1*41.
   
  Routine RGMTUT01 has been modified to change the entry point code
  for the remote query of the monthly MPI Statistics Report data.  It
  was also modified to make sure all XTMP globals are being cleared.
   
  Routine RGMTUT02 was modified to remove the check for the day the
  report is run.
  
  Routine RGEX04 was modified to kill ^TMP(RGPDAT.  This cleans up the TMP
  global to prevent a partial overwrite between remote queries done through
  the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option.
