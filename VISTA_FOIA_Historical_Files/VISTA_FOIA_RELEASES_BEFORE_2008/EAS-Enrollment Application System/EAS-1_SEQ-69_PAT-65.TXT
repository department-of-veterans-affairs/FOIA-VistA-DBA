Subject: FIX EAS MT RENEWAL LETTERS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two Remedy tickets that pertain to the printing of 
 the EAS means test letter functionality.
  
 Issue - A site discovered discrepancies regarding Means Test letters not 
 printing for a number of veterans due to an incorrect User Enrollee Site 
 (UES) being returned to the site from the Health Eligibility Center 
 (HEC).  It is believed the Primary UES issue was the result of a cross 
 reference problem in the HEC Database.  The primary issue in the HEC has 
 been corrected.  The primary fix is to allow the UES values to 
 re-synchronize over time; however, the impact of using this method is 
 that Means Test letters for the effected veterans cannot be printed.
  
 This patch addresses this secondary issue by providing a new option, User 
 Enrollee Site Print Override [EAS MT UES OVERRIDE], which allows an 
 override of the UES filtering subsystem under the following condition:
  
 *   Veteran appears in the "User Enrollee Status for Pending Means Test
     Letters" report with a UE Status of 'Diff. Site', and the site
     determines the UE Site value for the veteran is incorrect.
  
 Instructions are provided in the post-installation section below.

  Post-Installation
  =================
  
 1. After the patch is installed, the EAS MT UES OVERRIDE key must be 
 assigned to those individuals that will be authorized to print UES 
 override letters.  This should be strictly controlled to prevent the 
 inadvertent printing of Means Test letters for another site.  This 
 security key is also checked directly in the software application as well 
 as on the menu option.
  
 2. Individuals assigned this key will see the new menu option, User
 Enrollee Site Print Override [EAS MT UES OVERRIDE] on the Letters Print
 Menu [EAS MT PRINT MENU].
  
 3.  In order to print the letters for a different UE Site, you will need
 to know which site you will be printing the letters for.  The new option
 requires that you select the specific site for printing.  The option will 
 then ask which letter group to print, 60/30/0/ALL.  All other checks and 
 filters will be applied as in normal MT letter processing, with the 
 exception of the UE Status.
  
  Example:
  --------
  
 Select Letters Print Menu Option: USER Enrollee Site Print Override
  
 This option will allow the override of the current filters on the User
 Enrollee site.  By selecting a site, letters for veterans that are
 listed as a User Enrollee of that site can be printed.
 This option should be used with care!
  
 Select the User Enrollee site to print letters for: ALBANY
  
 Select the group of Letters to print:
  
     1: 60-Day   2: 30-Day Letters   4: 0-Day Letters
     ALL: All Letters
  
 Enter response: ALL  All Letters
  
  
 4. After the letters are printed, entries in the EAS MT LETTER STATUS 
 File (#713.2) will be updated and a print report will be sent to the EAS 
 MTLETTERS mail group.
  
  Example:
  --------
  
 Subj: EAS LETTER RESULTS BY UE SITE  [#84847] 07/30/07@15:03  9 lines
 From: EAS MT LETTERS  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   0-day letters printed: 3
                   Total: 18
  
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//
  
  
 5.  Any issues encountered with the letter printing will result in a 
 separate E-mail message to the EAS MTLETTERS mail group as well.
