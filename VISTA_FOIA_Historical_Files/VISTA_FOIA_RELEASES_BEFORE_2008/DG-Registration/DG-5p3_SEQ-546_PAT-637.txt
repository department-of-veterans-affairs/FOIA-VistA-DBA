Subject: 2005 Thresholds

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-071 - This patch MUST be installed before 
 January 1, 2005.  The patch may be installed out of sequence.
  
 The Means Test thresholds for income year 2004 provided in VHA DIRECTIVE 
 2004-071, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR 
 CALENDAR YEAR 2005 are distributed with this patch.  The 
 post-installation routine, DG53637P, will create a new sub-file entry (or 
 replace an existing one) for calendar year 2005 in the MEANS TEST DATA 
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS Parameters (#43) file.  Six sub-fields 
 within the multiple will be updated with the new Means Test threshold 
 data values as follows:
  
        MEANS TEST DATA (#.01) - 2005
        MT COPAY EXEMPT VET INCOME (#2)  - $25,842
        MT COPAY EXEMPT 1ST DEP INCOME (#3) - $5,171
        MT COPAY EXEMPT INCOME PER DEP (#4) - $1,734
        THRESHOLD PROPERTY (#8) - $80,000
        CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION (#17) - $8,200
  
 Note that this patch updates the thresholds for the Means Tests.  Patch 
 EAS*1.0*61 will address the annual updates for the GMT THRESHOLDS.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation will 
 take approximately 15 minutes.  The Geographic Means Test Threshold files 
 GMT THRESHOLDS #712.5 and GMT MSA CODE #712.6 updates (for every zip code 
 and every county) in patch EAS*1.0*61, are extensive.  Due to the volume 
 of updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop.  
 This is normal, as the file updates may take up to 15 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 after entries will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are 
 12,800 entries included in the #712.5 file (and 49927 entries included in 
 the #712.6 file) distributed with this patch and a comparison is done on 
 each of these entries.
  
  
   1.   Disable journaling for the ^EAS global using the appropriate method
        for your sites' operating system platform (i.e. DSM, Cache', etc.).
  
   2.   DOWNLOAD HOST KIDS FILE
        -----------------------
        Download the KIDS file DG_53_P637.KID from the
        ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt
        Lake CIOFO to the appropriate directory on your system.
   
   3.   LOAD DISTRIBUTION
        -----------------
        Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION
        menu, and enter:  DG_53_P637.KID. 
   
   4.   DISABLE ROUTINE MAPPING   (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
        -----------------------
        Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in
        step 3 below.
   
        NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in
               your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
