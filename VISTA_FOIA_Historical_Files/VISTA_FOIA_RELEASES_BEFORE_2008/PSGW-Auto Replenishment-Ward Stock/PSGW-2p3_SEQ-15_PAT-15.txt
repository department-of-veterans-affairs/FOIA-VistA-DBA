Subject: DD CLEANUP: AR/WS STATS FILE, ON-DEMAND REPORT FIX

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects two problems.
  
 1. It updates the AR/WS STATS FILE (#58.5), removing potential
 extraneous nodes from the data dictionary.  These extraneous nodes may
 cause errors when running Pharmacy Benefits Management extracts.
  
 2. It corrects a formatting problem when using the option Print an
 On-Demand Report by Date/AOU (80 column) [PSGW ON-DEMAND PRINT].
  
 The pre-installation routine for this patch deletes the entire data
 dictionary for the AR/WS STATS FILE (#58.5). If you have made local
 changes to the AR/WS STATS FILE (#58.5), they will need to be recreated
 after installation of the patch.

 PATCH INSTALLATION:  This patch may be installed at any time with Pharmacy
 users remaining on the system.  No options need to be placed out of
 service.  The patch is distributed in KIDS format in a PackMan message.
 Installation should take less than two minutes.
  
   
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
    2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
       be removed from the mapped set at this time. 
    
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
    4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSGW*2.3*15):
    
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
    
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
    
   
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       PSGW*2.3*15.
  
    
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//' respond NO.
    
    7. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
