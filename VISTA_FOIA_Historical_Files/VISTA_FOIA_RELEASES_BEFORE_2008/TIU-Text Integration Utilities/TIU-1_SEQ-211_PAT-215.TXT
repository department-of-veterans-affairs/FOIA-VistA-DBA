Subject: COPY DOCUMENT/DELETE A.R./ DISALLOW EDIT 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
   
 1) When using the Copy document option, the new document created has 
 the print name of the original document. This is a problem as the print
 name displayed in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
 2) Do not allow editing, deleting or amending functionality on 
 the Surgery Reports, Nurse Intraoperative Report and Anesthesia Report.
  
 3) When trying to delete an Interdisciplinary Parent note that has
 a Child note, the error message needs to be clearer.
  
 4) Patch TIU*1*152 did not include 'uncosigned' state when it was issued 
 to prevent edits to the completed documents.  Per patch USR*1*26 - TIU
 does not have a category "signed," however, the following categories are
 considered signed: Un-cosigned, completed, amended, and retracted.   
 According to the VHA Handbook 1907.01, no one may edit any document in
 these categories.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 Problem 1
 =========
 When using the Copy option to create a new document, the print name from
 original document is the print name for the newly created document.  
 Since the print name is what is displayed in CPRS this causes a problem.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Set the print name to be the same as the new document name when the copy
 is made.
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE:
 ==============
 No change is being made for TIU objects that do not have a
 print name.  This field will remain blank in the copy.
  
 Problem 2:
 ==========
 Surgery Nurse Intraoperative Report and Anesthesia Reports must be
 modified in the Surgery package so that SURGERY (#130) file stays 
 synchronized with TIU DOCUMENT (#8925) file.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 If using CPRS, Surgery tab you will not be able to Edit, Delete or Amend
 Nurse Intraoperative Report or Anesthesia Report. You will get an error
 message stating this needs to be done in the Surgery package.
            
  
 Problem 3:
 ==========
 When trying to delete an Interdisciplinary Parent note that has a Child
 note, the Warning message was not clear.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Message denying deletion has been expanded to give details on what must 
 be done if you really need to delete the Parent ID note.
 After the patch is installed, the new Warning message is displayed:
  
 "You may NOT delete this parent ID note. It has child ID notes 
 attached. If you need to delete this note you must first detach 
 the Child from the Parent note. Select Action/Detach from 
 Interdisciplinary note to accomplish this".
  
 Problem 4:
 ==========
 If there are business rules allowing the edit or Send Back of 
 notes in the uncosigned status the documents can be edited or Sent Back.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Do not allow editing or Send Back on documents in the uncosigned status
 even if business rules exist to allow editing or Send Back.
