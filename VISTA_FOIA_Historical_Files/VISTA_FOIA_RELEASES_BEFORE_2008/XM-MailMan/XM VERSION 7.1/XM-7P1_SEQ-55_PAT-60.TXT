Subject: PCTS 'NO NNNN' FAILURE FIX

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 Patch XM*7.1*60 is an informational patch put out in response to
 NOIS ISH-0295-40138.
 
 This patch is only for VMS sites.
 
 PCTS can fail at VMS sites when transmitting to Austin.  PCTS can fail to
 find "NNNN" as the message terminator and fail to receive the message. To
 fix it, the site must have the terminal characteristics for the outgoing
 LAT device set to pasthru.  The command is:
  
      $ SET/TERM/PERM/PASTHRU LTAxxx
  
 This command can be issued interactively on the node(s) the taskmanager(s)
 are running on. This command MUST be placed in the site's local LAT system
 startup file. The names of these files can be different at each site, so
 our recommandation is to place this command in the command file that sets
 your IDCU or PRINTER characterics.
