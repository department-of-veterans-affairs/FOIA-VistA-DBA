Subject: 2ND/3RD DIAGNOSIS CODES TRANSMITTING TO PL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When a diagnosis code and it's associated 2nd and/or 3rd diagnosis codes
 are marked to be added to the problem list, the codes are not sent to the
 problem list.  
  
 This patch will send the 2nd/3rd diagnosis codes to the problem list along
 with the primary code.
  
 When executing the option Maintenance Utility for Active/Inactive
 Codes [IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY], the 2nd and/or 3rd diagnosis codes
 are not displayed appropriately if the code(s) is inactive. This patch
 will display the inactive code along with the primary diagnosis and its
 associated codes.
  
 The following is an example.
