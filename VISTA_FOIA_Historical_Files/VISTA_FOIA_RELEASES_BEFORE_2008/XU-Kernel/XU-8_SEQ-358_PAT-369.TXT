                         XU*8.0*369
  
 Patch XU*8.0*369 contains two new options that provide the following 
 functionality to sites:
  
 1.  Compare local/national checksums report  [XU CHECKSUM REPORT]: This 
     option compares national routine checksums to local routine
     checksums.  National checksum information is stored in the
     ROUTINE file (#9.8).  The report contains the following sections and 
     information:
  
         a. ROUTINES MARKED FOR LOCAL TRACKING()
         This section lists all routines that are marked for "Local - 
         report".  In order to get a comparison as shown below for the
         routine ANDAFTP you need manually enter a CHECKSUM VALUE in the
         ROUTINE file using the output from CHECK1^XTSUMBLD if the CHECKSUM
         VALUE is Null.
         Sample output:
           Routine    CHKSUM BASE    Our CHKSUM   
           =======    ==========     =========== 
           ANDAFTP    B6609520       B6609517  
                      || CHECKSUM VALUE ENTERED MANUALLY IN ROUTINE FILE
  
         b. ROUTINES WITH THE CHECKSUM OFF()
         Routine   Nat CHKSUM  Our CHKSUM  Our Patch    Loc Mod  Patches 
                                                                 Needed
         =====     ==========  ==========  =======      ======   =========
  
         This section lists Class I routines that are marked for national 
         tracking where the local checksum value differs from the national
         checksum value. If the option can determine the routine is
         locally modified it will indicate YES in the Loc Mod column, if it
         can determine the routine is unmodified but needs patching it will
         list NO in the Loc Mod column and then display patches needed to
         bring the routine in compliance.  If the routine indicates a patch
         that hasn't been released, TESTING will appear in the Patches 
         Needed column. When the option can not determine if a routine is
         locally modified or a TEST patch it will state unknown in
         appropriate column.  The Our Patch column indicates the local
         patch level of the routine.  A count of routines in this section
         is provided.
  
         c. ROUTINES NOT FOUND IN THE SYSTEM() 
         Routine   Nat CHKSUM  Nat Last Patch
         =====    ==========   ==========
  
         This section lists Class I routines that are marked for national 
         tracking that do not exist at the site (local system).   Routine
         name, released checksum, and last patch release are listed.  A
         count of routines in this section is provided.
  
         d. ROUTINES NOT MARKED FOR TRACKING ()
         This section provides a count of routines that do not have field 
         #6 of file #9.8 set to National Tracking.
  
         e. ROUTINES WITH MATCHING CHECKSUMS ()
         This section provides a count of routines where local checksum 
         matches national checksum
  
         f. ROUTINE FILE TOTAL ENTRIES COUNT ()
         This section provides a count of entries in the routine file 
         (#9.8)
   
 2.  Load/refresh checksum values into ROUTINE file  [XU CHECKSUM LOAD]:  
    This option updates the routine file with the latest checksum values
    from FORUM via the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE of "XUMF FORUM". 
  
    NOTE:  The routine XU8P369 makes the change that the READ TIMEOUT of
           the logical link be set to 600 on the "XUMF FORUM" logical link.
  
 3. Data Dictionary (DD) changes to the ROUTINE file (#9.8) are as follows:
    This patch also updates data dictionary for CHECKSUM REPORT file (#6) 
    of Routine file (#9.8):
  
      9.8,6    CHECKSUM REPORT        6;1 SET
  
                         '0' FOR Local - don't report; 
                         '1' FOR Local - report; 
                         '2' FOR National - report; 
                         '3' FOR National - Deleted or NOT tracked;
          LAST EDITED:    OCT 17, 2006 
          DESCRIPTION:    Entries flagged with "National - report" should
                          not be changed, with "FOR National - Deleted or
                          NOT tracked" for routines that do not exist in
                          the system. Sites may determine if they want
                          reports on checksum differences for local
                          routines by selecting "Local - report".
  
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION NEED TO BE NOTED:
 ======================================
  - Please note that the ROUTINE file on FORUM is not completely up to 
    date.
  - If you find any problem with the ROUTINE file on FORUM, please report 
    direct to Ba Tran at ba.tran@med.va.gov or Wally Fort at
    wally.fort@med.va.gov. Please do not log a Remedy ticket.
  - The report will improve as FORUM is updated.
  - Users may run the option  Load/refresh checksum values into ROUTINE 
    file  [XU CHECKSUM LOAD] to update the routine file before running
    the  Compare local/national checksums report [XU CHECKSUM REPORT]
  
  - Users may use FileMan to set CHECKSUM REPORT field (#6) for routines: 
      Select OPTION:    ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
      INPUT TO WHAT FILE: ROUTINE// 
      EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 6  CHECKSUM REPORT
      THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
      Select ROUTINE NAME: XUGOT1  
      CHECKSUM REPORT: ?
        Choose from: 
          0        Local - don't report
          1        Local - report
          2        National - report
          3        National - Deleted or NOT tracked
