Subject: TALLY UNBILLED REFILL COPAYS RELEASED BY OPAI

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will produce a Tally of potentially missed Outpatient 
 Pharmacy Copay charges that involved Automated-Released Refills.
 This only pertains to refills that were released through the Outpatient
 Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI v2.4).
  
 **NOTE**
  
 After the talley runs, please do not have the Ingrated Billing department 
 start billing for these outstanding refills.  It will be determined if we 
 are to release a national patch that will backbill for these refills.  If 
 your site manually bills, then we could bill twice when the national patch
 is released. Features of the Tally patch:
  
  
 1. HD101123 - Refills not billing Co-pay.
 =========================================
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the new OPAI interface and a refill is dispensed by an
 External dispensing machine, Co-pays are not being billed for refills 
 only. The fill number variable used by the Co-pay Logic was not being
 initialized and therefore was not billed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Patch PSO*7*209 was released to correct the problem and this patch will 
 produce a Tally report to determine the potential prescription refills 
 that need to be back billed.

 **NOTE**
  
 After the talley runs, please do not have the Ingrated Billing department 
 start billing for these outstanding refills.  It will be determined if we 
 are to release a national patch that will backbill for these refills.  If 
 your site manually bills, then we could bill twice when the national patch
 is released. Features of the Tally patch:
  
   1. Summary mailman messages.
   2. Detailed Report by Veteran.
   3. Status Query while running job.
   4. Stop Job command.
   5. Restart command.
     
   See samples section below for images of these features.
  
 1. The Tally will produce a summary mail message of its findings and send
    to all users that hold the 'PSO COPAY' security key.  
    
    A mailman message with the tally of the numbers by station will be sent
    back to individuals to produce a Management spreadsheet to determine if
    a subsequent Automated Copay Back-Billing patch will be required
    nationally.
  
 2. A detailed report by Veteran and refill number can be produced on 
    demand.
  
 3. To check the status of the Tally background job while it is running, 
    type from the direct programmers prompt the command D STATUS^PSOCPBK1.
  
 4. If you need to stop the Tally background job for any reason, then from 
    the direct programmers prompt type the command D STOP^PSOCPBK1.
  
 5. If you need to run this manually again for any reason, then from the 
    direct programmers prompt type the command D ^PSOCPBK1, and answer the 
    prompt asking for what time to schedule the job.  This will run the 
    Tally fresh from the very beginning.
