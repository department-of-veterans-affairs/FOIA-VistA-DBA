Description:
============

 ********************************** N O T E *******************************
 * There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS implementation.*
 * Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any     *
 * problems.                                                              *

 Overview:
 --------
 This patch will provide a routine and option that can be run to produce
 a printed worksheet to be used to record payer-specific provider id
 requirements. This worksheet is to be used as a guide to allow the site to
 insure the provider ids are defined correctly at the site.  This will 
 help to minimize problems when EDI (Electronic Data Interface)
 Enhancements patch IB*2*232 is installed and the new HIPAA (Health
 Information Portability and Accountability Act) format is to be used for
 transmitting electronic claims.
  
 The patch also includes the capability to print out a 'solutions' section
 that can be used as a guide to set up the more common scenarios we have
 found for special provider ids.
  
 The worksheets can be printed with all the names of the BLUE CROSS, BLUE
 SHIELD and TRICARE insurance companies or as blank sheets where insurance
 companies can be individually written in.  The outputs are scaled to fit
 the width of the printer device selected so if the printer's margin is
 either 80 or 132, the entire width of the page is used.
  
 The option can be assigned as a secondary option to whomever will need to
 produce these worksheets.

   8.  POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
      -------------------------------
       This patch adds a new option Provider ID Worksheet [IBCE
       PROVIDER ID WORKSHEET] to the system, but does not include it as a
       menu item on any menus.  Ask your Integrated Billing (IB) ADPAC who
       will be using this option and assign it accordingly as a secondary
       menu option.  This would typically be used by someone in a
       supervisory position within IB.
