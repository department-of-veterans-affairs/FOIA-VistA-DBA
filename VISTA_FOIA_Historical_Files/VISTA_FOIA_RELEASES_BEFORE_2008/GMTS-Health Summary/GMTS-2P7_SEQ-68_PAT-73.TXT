 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1. CPH-0503-40325 / HD0000000067625  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the patient demographics are displayed from the Health Summary 
    via CPRS Reports / Inpatient  Health Summary; If the Branch of Service 
    of the Patient is "Marine Corps" or "Merchant Seaman"  the "TO" date
    is cut off and not displayed corrected.
    The routine that assembles the display assumes a line length based on 
    two columns and two headers. This does not allow enough room when the
    Branch of Service text is longer as in the two examples above.  Army,
    Navy and Air Force fit.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    The process that calculates the line length was modified to take in  
    consideration and allow the longer line when there is only one column
    and one header as in the case of the Branch of  Service display line.
