Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
  The purpose of this patch is to synchronize VistA's STATE(#5) and the
 COUNTY CODE(#5.13) files with the Austin Automation Center's(AAC) for 
 the 50 United States, it's territories, and recognized foreign
 countries.  Any entries that are "local", that is, not contained in the 
 following table, will be flagged as not recognized by the AAC upon 
 completion of installation so the "local" entries can be screened out for
 certain STATE(#5) file look ups.  All three values in the following table 
 MUST match your VistA STATE(#5) entry.

 1. The environment check routine, XU8P378E, checks your STATE(#5)
 file to see if there are any issues that will need manual
 correction(s).  Please see the section of this description
 called: "Example Installation With Environment Check Routine
 Failure" for an example.
  
 2. Patch makes corrections to the States in the STATE(#5) file and flag
 any "States" that are not recognized by the AAC.  Also, makes corrections
 to the COUNTY CODE(#5.13) file and fixes any broken pointers in the 
 COUNTY CODE(#5.13) file.
  Routine: XU8P378A
  
 3. Because the Regular C cross reference is defined on both the
 ABBREVIATION(#1) and VA STATE CODE(#2)fields in the STATE(#5) file, it 
 was possible when doing re-index on either one of these fields for one or 
 the other's values to be indexed but not both, therefore a new style 
 cross reference is being added, ADUALC, for indexing purposes.
  Routine: XU8P378B
  
 4. New DELete and LAYGO nodes will be added to the following files to 
 prevent deletions and the addition of new entries:
   File: STATE(#5), Field: NAME(#.01)
   Sub-File: COUNTY(#5.01), Field: COUNTY(#.01)
   File: COUNTY CODE(#5.13), Field: FIPS CODE(#.01)
  
  A new DELete node will added to the following file:
   File: POSTAL CODE(#5.12), Field: MAIL CODE(#.01)
  Routine: XU8P378C
  
 5.  Finally, the STATE(#5) file will be synchronized with the COUNTY 
 CODE(#5.13) file.  And a scan will be done of the COUNTY CODE(#5.13) file
 and the STATE(#5) file and a VistA e-mail will be sent to:
  -The patch installer
  -New Mail Group: XIP SERVER RESPONSE
  -GAL group: VHA HEC DQ SUPPORT(hecdqsupport@med.va.gov)  Note: this group
 will be coordinating any further changes to the COUNTY CODE(#5.13) and 
 STATE(#5) files.
  Routine: XU8P378

 For example:
 >D ^%GOGEN
  
 Device: <use your naming convention>   Parameters: "WNS"=>
 Warning:  Use a "V" format to avoid problems with control characters.
 Global ^DIC(5,
 Global ^XIP(5.13,
 Global ^

 Many thanks goes to the test sites their help on this section.
 >> Notes <<
 The Environment check looks at your STATE(#5) to see if there are any 
 of the following failure conditions:
 1. Duplicate NAME(#.01)s.
 2. Duplicate ABBREVIATION(#1)s.
 3. Duplicate VA STATE CODE(#2)s.
 4. Any entries that are not EXACT matches to the above table.
  
 If the Environment check routine encounters no problems, skip to
 section "Rest Of Example Installation".
  
 The following is an example of how the above environment check failures,
 were corrected. DO NOT DELETE any entries, because this could cause broken
 pointer values in other VistA files.
  
 There are three warning types of failure codes: 
  
 1. "[W]Not a recognized VistA State", will display if the state NAME, VA
 STATE CODE or ABBREVIATION are incorrect.  If it s a single entry, editing
 the appropriate field(s) will resolve this failure.  In the example below,
 the standard state file determined that 90 is the standard VA STATE CODE
 for the state FOREIGN COUNTRY.  Use VA FileMan to edit the NAME and
 ABBREVIATION.
  
 IEN^NAME(#.01)^ABBREVIATION(#1)^VA STATE CODE(#2)^[W]arning/[F]ailure Reason
 52^OTHER^OT^90^[W]Not a recognized VistA State
  
 2. "[F]Duplicate State NAME(#.01)", will display if multiple entries with 
     the same NAME(#.01) exist.
    "[F]Duplicate State ABBREVIATION(#1), will display if multiple entries 
     with the same ABBREVIATION(#1) exist.
    "[F]Duplicate VA STATE CODE(#2)", will display if multiple entries 
     with the same VA STATE CODE(#2) exist.
 In the duplicate example below, there are two Internal Entry Numbers(IEN)
 for the same state. Select one of the IEN entries and edit with correct
 standard NAME and ABBREVIATION codes from the patch standardized listing
 and "Z" out the rest as shown in the corrective action examples below.  
 Once you correct one of the duplicate entries, it will resolve the "[W]Not
 a recognized VistA State".

 3. "[F]State not found in STATE(#5) file", will display if the state does
 not match any of the entries in the State file.  First check for a 
 SPELLING problem to correct the issue, otherwise use VA Fileman 
 Enter/Edit to add the new entry(s) utilizing the
 standardized state data listing provided with this patch.
  
 NOTE: Please be aware that the Internal Entry Number(IEN) will not 
 necessarily match the VA STATE CODE(#2) value. In the example below see
 how the "[F]State not found in STATE(#5) file" warning for "JOHNSTON
 ATOLL" was corrected to "U.S. MINOR OUTLYING ISLANDS".
  
 If an IEN is listed in the display, it is referring to the entry in site s
 STATE file. Otherwise, it is referring to standard AAC State file. In the
 following example, the Warning message is that the name listed at IEN 107
 in SITE s State file is not recognized by AAC Standard file and the
 Failure message is that the name (correct name) listed is missing in SITE
 s State file. Once the space is removed from the State name, it takes care
 of both the Warning and the Failure.

 To identify changes that will be necessary to make, it may be useful to
 import the ^ delimited "environment check" data into an Excel spreadsheet
 and sort on the State Name column, or on the Abbreviation column or on the
 VA State Code column. To test whether or not your edits will pass the
 environment check routine before your start the install again, from
 programmer mode:
