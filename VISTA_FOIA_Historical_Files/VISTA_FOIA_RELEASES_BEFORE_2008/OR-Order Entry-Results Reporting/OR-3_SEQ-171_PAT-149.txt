Description: 
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch OR*3*149 implements Section 508 functionality.  Numerous 
 other enhancements and fixes, noted below, are also included.  
  
 -- ALL SCREENS
  
 - Different Windows color schemes are supported.  All CPRS screens now 
 reflect the color scheme in use.  Cream color for read-only data is only 
 used when font color in scheme is black.  Otherwise, read-only data is 
 unmarked or appears in tooltip hint colors.  The black-on-black and 
 white-on-white problems that appeared under non-standard Windows color 
 schemes are fixed.
  
 - Editing fields that accept tabs (such as the new note field) can now be 
 exited through the keyboard: <Control-Tab> keystroke will move focus to the 
 next item in the tab sequence; <Escape>, <Shift-Tab> and 
 <Shift-Control-Tab> keystrokes will move focus to the previous item.
  
 - Forms that contain tabbed sheets allow the navigation of these tabs using 
 <Control-Tab> and <Shift-Control-Tab>, provided that the focus is not in an 
 editing field that accepts tabs.
  
 - Active Accessibility changes have been made to many screens.  CPRS should 
 work well enough with common screen readers (text-to-voice) that navigation 
 is possible without cues from the screen.  Navigation is also possible 
 using common voice-to-text software.
  
 - Font sizes are now applied to all screens.  Font changes will generally 
 resize screen components to fit the font.  Some Order screens that retain 
 their saved preferences do not get resized.  You will have to manually 
 resize these screens once, and then CPRS will remember the new screen 
 dimensions in following sessions.  NOTE: CPRS does not change the system 
 font sizes, which are used in menus and alert boxes.  The user that wants 
 consistency will need to go into the desktop options and change or modify 
 his Windows color scheme.
  
 - The tab sequence (the order that controls are activated by using the tab 
 key to navigate through them) has been cleaned up.  Tab order generally 
 proceeds from left to right and from top to bottom.  Speed buttons, as well 
 as open or closed drawers are now included in the tab sequence.  Hidden 
 controls are not included in the tab sequence.  HTML pages do not respond 
 to focus, so are not included in the tab sequence.
  
 - NOIS: SHR-1099-72902 - Font sizes are now saved between sessions.
  
 -- COM OBJECT REGISTRATION DURING INSTALLATION
  
 - Section 508 changes necessitated inclusion of some COM objects in 
 CPRS.  During installation, registration of these objects was restricted 
 due to a bug in Delphi's COM object registration code.  This was 
 corrected and registration should proceed without problems now.  However, 
 a Poweruser or Administrator user will still need to run the application 
 one time following installation on any workstation where a disabled user 
 will wish to utilize applications which access the COM objects while 
 using CPRS GUI.  
  
 -- PATIENT SELECTION SCREEN
  
 - Pressing <Ctrl-D> while in the patient list toggles the display of 
 patient demographics from the current display to a display inside a memo 
 field where text is highlighted.  This feature lets text-to-voice software 
 quickly read patient demographic information when needed.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0400-50702 - When viewing Wards, name column has room for 
 longer names before Room/Bed column.  Also fixed bug where when Default 
 View is Wards, the Room/Bed was not showing up.
  
 - NOIS: SHE-0701-51513 - When selecting a patient from a Ward, the short 
 list would disappear.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CHA-0499-31537 - When all patients displayed, the short list 
 (containing the last patient seen) is only shown on startup. 
  
 -- LOCATION SELECTION
  
 - NOIS: LEX-0300-43110, LEX-0902-41608  - Location selection in the GUI 
 was not consistent with LM location selection.   "Other" type hospital 
 locations were not included.  This has been changed to improve the GUI 
 selection functionality and to make it consistent with LM practices.
  
 -- DRAWERS
  
 - A user can now open or close reminder and template drawers by pressing 
 the space bar when the drawer is selected.
  
 - NOIS: ISH-1001-42951 - Added shortcuts to pop-up menu in templates 
 drawer:
  
     Copy Template Text: Ctrl+C
     Preview/Print Template: Ctrl+W
     Goto Default: Ctrl+G
     Mark as Default: Ctrl+Space
     Find Templates: Ctrl+F
     Insert Template: Ctrl+Ins
     View Template Notes: Ctrl+V
  
 -- REPORTS
  
 - When the "Clinical Reports\Radiology\Imaging (local only)" branch is
 selected a new treeview will display in the lower left corner containing a
 hierarchical view of the parent and descendant procedures.  If a  
 stand-alone procedure is selected, the report will be displayed and a new
 label above the procedures listview will indicate "Standalone - single
 procedure".  If a parent procedure is selected for which all descendents
 share a report, the report will be displayed and the new label above the
 procedure listview will indicate "Descendent Procedures with shared
 report".  If a parent procedure is selected for which all descendents have
 individual reports, the report will not be displayed and the new label
 above the procedure listview will indicate "Descendent Procedures - Select
 to view individual reports".  If a descendent procedure is selected the
 associated report will be displayed.  
  
 - As a side effect of the above changes, a problem reported in
 WRJ-1202-50989, related to raw Mumps data being displayed, was also
 corrected.
  
 - A user can now view a selected report by pressing the space bar.
  
 - NOIS JAC-0103-70775: Fixed problem that was created in v20 of the GUI 
 that was keeping Medicine Procedures from printing to a DHCP printer.
  
 - E3R: #17541, NOIS: HUN-1002-20538 - A new column was added to 
 the "Imaging (local only)" reports list to reflect "Exam Status".  This 
 will be displayed in addition to "Report Status", and will help clarify the 
 meaning of "No Report" appearing in that existing column. 
  
 - Sites have reported long delays when selecting remote sites after 
 clicking on the Blue Remote Data Views button, while CPRS tries to do a 
 direct connect with the selected remote sites to check for connectivity, 
 remote procedure compatibility and sensitive patient information.  These 
 checks have been disabled in this version, which will speed up the 
 process of getting remote data.  Any failed remote queries will continue 
 to show in the list of remote sites when clicking on the Blue remote data 
 button.

 -- NOTES/CONSULTS/DISCHARGE SUMMARY/SURGERY
  
 - Shortcuts were added, similar to default key strokes, to the Action Menu:
  
     New Progress Note...: Shift+Ctrl+N  
        (CONSULTS - Complete/Update Results : Shift+Ctrl+U)
     Make Addendum...: Shift+Ctrl+M
     Change Title...: Shift+Ctrl+C
     Delete Progress Note...: Shift+Ctrl+D
     Edit Progress Note...: Shift+Ctrl+E
     Save without Signature: Shift+Ctrl+A
     Sign Note Now...: Shift+Ctrl+G
  
 - To remove conflicting shortcuts, the "Reformat" shortcut has been changed 
 from CTRL-R to SHIFT-CTRL-R.  Similarly, the "Save and Continue" shortcut 
 was changed from CTRL-S to SHIFT-CTRL-S.  Additionally, new items have been 
 added to the popup menu in the editing field:
  
     Preview/Print Current Template: Ctrl-W
     Insert Current Template: Ctrl-Ins
     Edit Encounter Information: Ctrl-E
  
 - (Text-to-voice software): The note tree views alter the text they supply 
 to text-to-voice software to aid navigation.  The text begins where it 
 differs from the previous entry, and the common text is included in 
 parentheses at the end.  For instance, if the items in the tree view 
 were:
  
     Oct 01,02 ID CHILD BARRY, 1A(1&2), GARY EGLI
     Oct 01,02 ID CHILD AMY, 1A(1&2), GARY EGLI
  
 then the text-to-voice software would voice the second line as:
  
     AMY, 1A(1&2), GARY EGLI (Oct 01,02  ID CHILD)
  
 This "short name" functionality only affects accessibility software.
  
 - NOIS: FNC-0302-32025 - Fixed Access Violation when creating new note 
 while JAWS text-to-voice software is being used.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0599-50862, WIC-1000-42228, MAC-0401-61264 - When beginning a 
 new TIU document with no current visit defined, the user is required to 
 select a visit before continuing.  In this scenario, the "New Visit" tab of 
 the visit selection form did not previously respect the user's TIU personal 
 preference for default location.  This has been corrected.  
  
 - NOIS: CHY-0802-51098, SLC-0702-51512, NHM-0802-11099, LAS-0802-61291, 
 DUB-0802-32068, TUA-0902-31341, MAN-0902-11354, ERI-1102-20210, 
 MAR-1102-20666, SAG-0902-41964, SAM-1102-21519, BEC-1102-21756, 
 GRJ-1102-52199 - Added code to disable the auto-save timer while a save is 
 currently in progress.  This should prevent the auto-save error reported in 
 numerous NOIS calls. 
  
 - Added similar code to the spell and grammar check menu items on all tabs, 
 so that an auto-save should not begin while a spell or grammar check is in 
 progress.  This may or may not have been a contributing factor to earlier 
 spell/checker problems, but should reduce the possibility of problems in 
 any case.
  
 - If a date range view of notes was selected with TODAY as the end date, 
 notes entered today were displayed in the treeview, but not in the upper 
 right-hand listview.  This has been corrected. (COA-1202-21927)
  
 - The edit width for progress notes is now limited to 74 characters.  The 
 vertical scrollbar should no longer disappear.  This applies to the 
 Notes, Consults, D/C Summary and Surgery tabs. (SDC-0801-61318, 
 CLA-1201-21047, BAY-0302-30627, HON-0302-61446, MAR-0302-21736, 
 PRO-0502-12122, MAC-0602-62654, MIA-0602-33096, SLC-0702-52378, 
 TUA-1102-32011, PRE-0103-61732) 
  
 -- PROGRESS NOTE PROPERTIES 
  
 - The note title combo box now provides "short name" functionality for 
 text-to-voice software.  See entry in NOTES/CONSULTS/DISCHARGE 
 SUMMARY/SURGERY for detailed description.
  
 - On the Note Properties dialog, selecting a consults title no longer 
 deselects a previously-selected consult.
  
 -- CONSULTS
  
 - E3R# 16981 - When beginning a new note from the Notes tab, a check is 
 now made to determine whether the current user has any unresolved consults 
 that he/she may wish to address.  If any are found, a short message to that 
 effect is displayed, and asks if the user would like to display a list of 
 these consults.  Clicking "YES" will display the note title selection screen 
 with unresolved consults listed below.  Clicking "IGNORE" will proceed to the 
 same title selection screen as if writing a progress note, and not display 
 the consults.  Whether or not the message is displayed is controlled by a 
 new parameter ORWOR SHOW CONSULTS, which can be set by PACKAGE, SYSTEM, 
 DIVISION, or USER. The exported PACKAGE value is to display the message.  
 (This E3R has been endorsed by HIMS as a Medical Records issue with the 
 ever-growing list of incomplete consults.)
  
 - E3R#'s 13654, 17381, NOIS: LON-0701-62384 - For the "Add 
 Comment", "Schedule", and "Significant Findings" actions, the 
 selection of alert recipients has been modified.  If the user is not 
 the ordering provider, then the ordering provider will automatically be 
 sent an alert.  If the user is not an update user for the receiving 
 service, then all update users for that service will now automatically be 
 alerted.  If the user fits neither of those categories, then both the 
 ordering provider and the receiving service's update users will 
 automatically be alerted.  A statement will appear above the alert checkbox 
 telling the user who will automatically receive alerts.  The user can also 
 send additional alerts by the same method currently available for those 
 actions.  Automatic alert recipients will not appear in the selected 
 recipients list if additional alert recipients are being designated, and 
 will receive alerts without being manually added to that list. 
  
 - NOIS: PUG-0403-51270 - The "Services Rendered As" entry of Inpatient or 
 Outpatient was sometimes not being passed correctly to the order, even 
 though correctly checked on the form.  This has been corrected.
  
 - Corrected a problem where processing an alert that led to the Consults 
 tab was producing the error message "Cannot focus a disabled or invisible 
 window."
  
 - Corrected a problem where, if editing a note on the Consults tab and 
 then changing to a different tab while editing, the note disappeared from 
 the Consults tab.  It was saved and still visible from the Notes tab, but 
 possibly no longer linked to the selected consult.
  
 - Corrected a forwarding issue related to procedures only.  Not all 
 available services who could receive that type of procedure were 
 selectable.
  
 -- TEMPLATES
  
 - CHECKBOX FOCUS AND CAPTIONS: Parent checkboxes on templates and 
 subtemplates now display a standard Windows focus rectangle when they 
 have focus.  This is achieved without adding any additional text lines to 
 templates to accommodate an associated checkbox caption.  Each parent 
 checkbox has an associated caption that is readable by screen-readers, 
 but which is not visible on the template display.  A screen-reader user 
 is therefore, able to navigate around the screen and hear the captions 
 that are associated with parent checkboxes, but those same captions are 
 not visible on the template display, thereby preserving the original 
 "look and feel" of the templates.
  
 - When a COM object is assigned to a TIU title via a template, and that COM 
 object is executed by selection of that title, the TIU document IEN in file 
 8925 is now passed in the COM object's "Data2" parameter in XML format, as 
 follows, where 'nnnnn' is the document IEN.  Author information is also 
 passed in Data2, as shown, where AUTHOR_IEN contains a pointer to the 
 author's entry in the NEW PERSON file:
  
     <TIU_DOC>
       <DOC_IEN>nnnnn</DOC_IEN>
        <AUTHOR_IEN>nnnnn</AUTHOR_IEN>
        <AUTHOR_NAME>last,first</AUTHOR_NAME>
     </TIU_DOC>
  
 - If that same COM object returns a change of author, in the same format 
 shown, the CPRS Notes tab will validate that author, determine any 
 cosignature requirements, and if possible, update the current note with the 
 new author information.  The other TIU tabs (Consults, Surgery, Discharge 
 Summary) do not yet support this change-of-author functionality, because of 
 other complicating factors related to who may be the author of a document 
 on those tabs. 
  
 - E3R# 17150 - The original documentation outlining COM object interfacing 
 to CPRS has been updated to reflect this new functionality.  
  
 -- ENCOUNTER FORM
  
 - NOIS: MAC-0501-61136, MAC-0201-61795, SLC-0801-52086 - It is now a 
 requirement to enter a provider responsible for each new procedure 
 entered on the PROCEDURES tab.  Existing procedures on existing encounters 
 are not retroactively requiring this information.  One result of this 
 change should be that editing of CPT information in PCE via the CPRS 
 encounter form should now work correctly.  
  
 - NOIS: FAR-0102-42056, POR-0502-52623 - If two patients were booked for 
 the same date/time and location, via an overbook or a group visit, 
 selecting the encounter form for a second patient in this group would 
 result in the first patient's encounter form selections being pre-stuffed 
 for that subsequent patient.  This incorrect data existed only on the 
 client, and was not yet saved, but could result in acceptance of incorrect 
 encounter information for those subsequent patients.  This has been 
 corrected.  
  
 - The list of providers selectable on the Procedures tab was not derived 
 by the same method as the list of providers on the Visit Type tab.  Now, 
 instead of the procedure provider screening on the PROVIDER key, a valid 
 person class in file 200 as of the encounter date is required, as has 
 been the case on the Visit Type tab.  The exception on both tabs is for 
 event historical visits, where the entire NEW PERSON file remains 
 selectable as before.
  
 - There will now be a default entry for the provider on the Procedures 
 tab for each procedure/CPT code entered.  In order of 
 precedence/availability, this default will be either the currently 
 selected encounter provider as shown on the toolbar, the current user, or 
 the currently designated primary encounter provider.  If none of these 
 can be selected as the provider, then no default will be preset.
  
 -- COVER SHEET
  
 - The patient info box no longer has a light blue background.  Instead, the 
 patient info box uses the tool tip colors to appear as read-only text.
  
 - When a user uses the tab key to navigate through fields, the focus stays 
 on the active tab.
  
 - NOIS: SDC-0102-61412 - Panel dimensions are now saved between sessions.
  
 - NOIS: WPB-0298-30483 - The Provider Name is now displayed in correct 
 mixed-case format.  
  
 - A bug was causing the bottom row of lists to not resize when the bottom 
 splitter was moved, which created a lot of empty space on form.  This has 
 been fixed.  This also fixed other strange sizing bugs in v21.6.
  
 -- OPTIONS
  
 - Rapid clicking on unfocused check boxes no longer causes focused checkbox 
 to change.
  
 -- EVENT DELAYED ORDERS
  
 - NOIS: HIN-0103-40640,MAD-1202-41810,CHA-0103-30592: When placing a 
 medication quick order for a delayed admission event, users received the 
 error "This drug may not be ordered for an outpatient". This has been 
 fixed. 
  
 -- ORDERS
  
 - Unsigned orders are now underlined.  Unsigned orders for the current 
 provider are now bold and underlined.
  
 - Flagged orders now have a tag reading "*Flagged*" added to the end of the 
 order field, in much the same way that unsigned orders are marked 
 "*Unsigned*".
  
 - Right-clicking on an unselected order will show the popup menu and select 
 the order.
  
 - The Order Check list displayed after Accepting an order now has scroll 
 bars if multiple order check messages exist.
  
 - Blue and Red highlighting is disabled when running under incompatible 
 Windows color schemes.
  
 - The message box that pops up in the order screens now acts a little 
 differently.  It does not disappear as quickly, so that it is accessible to 
 text-to-speech utilities.  Clicking on text does not make it disappear, but 
 clicking on info glyph does.  Additionally, code has been added to let the 
 user drag the message box to a different position on the forms.
  
 - NOIS WAS-0103-20776: In CPRS, the opened med order dialog automatically 
 closed when switching tabs between Orders and Meds.  This has been fixed. 
  
 - NOIS MWV-0702-20284, MIW-0702-42956:  Patient Safety Issue - When 
 processing an outpatient med order, when a pharmacist copied the provider 
 comment to Patient Instruction (PI), then later if a clinician tried to 
 change this order to a different dosage or schedule, the original 
 provider comment appeared in the PI label and could not be edited.  Also, 
 for a long PI the patient instruction text couldn't be fully displayed in 
 the med order dialog.  These have been fixed. 
  
 - NOIS PHO-0103-60618:  Users were unable to copy a inpatient medication 
 order to outpatient on delayed discharge event.  This was fixed.
  
 - NOIS WAS-0103-20776:  Users could not switch between Meds and Orders 
 tab with an opened order dialog.  This was fixed. 
  
 - NOIS FAR-0103-40836:  For the delayed admit order on an outpatient, the 
 active event default order didn't get printed.  This was fixed. 
  
 - A vertical splitter has been added above New Orders button to allow 
 resizing of the orders list column.
  
 - NOIS: PRE-0201-61808, BAC-0501-41554 - When verifying changed orders, 
 the replaced orders were not being auto-verified as intended; in GUI the 
 replaced orders were not auto-verified at all, and in List Manager only 
 the first replaced order (if there were more than one) would be 
 auto-verified.  If the verification was done via Pharmacy package options 
 for med orders, the order was not being updated if the replaced order had 
 already been verified.  Items fixed.
  
 - In the inpatient medication order dialog, the "First Dose Now" check 
 box caused some confusion among clinicians. It has been changed to "Give 
 additional dose now." 
  
 -- CUSTOM ORDER MENU
  
 - To avoid color coding, visited menu items are underlined.  Whatever made 
 menu items underlined now makes then bolded.
  
 -- INPATIENT/OUTPATIENT MEDICATION ORDERS
  
 - In the Complex Meds grid, the user can now bring up the field editors by 
 pressing the enter key.  The user can insert a row by pressing the insert 
 key.   The user can delete the currently selected row by pressing delete.  
 The user can drop down the list on the "then/and" editor by pressing space.
  
 - In the Complex Meds grid, the user is now prevented from entering a new 
 dosage into a row unless the previous row has a dosage.  This complements 
 an existing behavior where the user is prevented from entering other data 
 on a row without a dosage.  Note that gaps can still occur if the user 
 presses the "Insert Row" button.
  
 - By maximizing the Medication Orders screen and selecting a non-formulary 
 drug, the user could bring up an inaccessible alert box.  Focus then could 
 not be returned to the program.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CPH-0902-40822 - By using tab key to navigate each box for placing 
 a complex outpatient med order, the quantity could not be calculated 
 correctly. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: UNY-0702-11996 - For a lab order which was previously accepted by 
 LES (Lab Expert System), if modified and the modified order was deleted by 
 LES, the order was still added to the order sheet in CPRS because of lack 
 of communication between CPRS and LES for processing modified lab orders. 
 This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: JAC-0602-72390 - for some IV orders on an outpatient, the DEA check 
 logic was incorrect and presented a DEA requirement message even though the 
 orderable item should not have required a DEA check. This was fixed.
  
 - For Inpatient Complex Orders the Change action was not allowed for any 
 child orders of a complex order.  For Discontinue/Hold/Release Hold/Verify, 
 all or none of the child orders of a complex order had to be selected in 
 order to take action.  The renew action is only allowed on a complex order 
 with the "AND" conjunction.  A complex order with the "THEN" conjunction 
 now cannot be renewed.
  
 -- LAB ORDERS
  
 - A user can now navigate the calendar in the "future" order popup using
 <Alt-Arrows> and <PageUp>/<PageDown>.
  
 - NOIS: ALB-0700-50831 - Added right-click menu to lab order message box to 
 allow user to view complex lab messages in a report box.
  
 -- PROCEDURE ORDERS
  
 - NOIS: BAY-0402-32054, HOU-0802-71657 - Corrected reported issue where 
 Provisional Diagnosis value and prompting requirements were carrying over 
 not only between quick orders, but also between successive patients. 
  
 - "List Index Out of Bounds(-1)" error that occurred when an inactive 
 orderable item was included in a procedure quick order was corrected.  The 
 generic Procedures order dialog will now be displayed in that situation. 
 (From V20 patch tracker.)
  
 -- DIET ORDERS
  
 - A new radio button named <none selected> has been added to the Meals 
 group.  This is selected by default, and preserves all behavior that 
 would occur in earlier versions if no meal were selected.
  
 -- ALLERGY ORDERING
  
 - NOIS: SBY-0901-30661 - A patient safety issue was reported has been 
 corrected.  In certain circumstances.  The REACTION TYPE was not being 
 passed from the client to the server when the ACCEPT button was clicked, 
 resulting in an allergy/adverse reaction that was missing this piece of 
 information.  The situation also caused a server error at ALG+6^ORMBLDAL, 
 which was also corrected.
  
 -- SPELLING AND GRAMMAR CHECKING
  
 - NOIS: HUN-0802-20049, MIN-0802-40944, HIN-0802-41251, DET-0802-41296 - A
 patient safety issue was reported in v19.15 which resulted in the disabling 
 of spelling and grammar checking in an emergency v19.16.  Users were 
 reporting that some or all of the text of the document being checked was 
 disappearing on returning from the spelling or grammar check.  Portions of 
 notes were being lost in this manner.  This version re-enables the spelling 
 and grammar checking functionality.  A separate document has been provided 
 outlining which issues have definitely been addressed and which more minor 
 issues could not be addressed due to limitations of Delphi, Microsoft Word, 
 or Windows itself. 
  
 - Although spell-checking issues are believed to be corrected, the absolute 
 correct behavior of this functionality may be very workstation-specific, or 
 even user-specific.  To provide a means of control of this functionality at 
 the site level in the event that further problems are encountered, a new 
 parameter has been added, "ORWOR SPELL CHECK ENABLED?", which can be set at 
 the PACKAGE, SYSTEM, and USER levels via the XPAR MENU TOOLS options.  This 
 parameter now controls the availability of both spelling and grammar 
 checking in the GUI.  The exported PACKAGE value with this patch is 
 ENABLED.
  
 - NOIS: PUG-1001-52969 - A hover hint was added to the Consults title and 
 Discharge Summary title.  Thus if the screen is unable to display the 
 entire title, hovering the cursor over it will cause a full display.
  
 - Corrected a problem noted at some sites where text returned to the note 
 by the spell-checker was being wrapped inappropriately.
  
 -- STARTUP
  
 - CPRS GUI determines client and server versions, then decides whether

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================= 
  
 Section 508 Note: For disabled users the client side executable program 
 will need to be initially run one time by a user logged in as 
 Administrator; this is required for third party programs such as "JAWS" or 
 "WindowEyes" to properly create COM registry entries.  Following this initial 
 startup, the program should subsequently operate with the provided 508 
 functionality on that workstation for non-Administrator logins.  
  
 This patch will be installed as part of a multi-package install.  For 
 actual installation instructions, see the INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS from 
 Patch OR*3.0*173.
