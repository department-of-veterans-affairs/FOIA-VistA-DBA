 This patch corrects problems with Statistical Analysis of Global Growth
 (SAGG) package for the Cache for OpenVMS implementation.
  
 This patch will add the creation date to the ^XTMP("KMPS",0) global to
 make the node SACC compliant for all M implementation platforms.
  
 This patch updates the 'Check SAGG Environment' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] option.
  
  
 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL
  
 The software patch is being distributed as a host file.
  
   Host file name: KMPS1_8_3.KID
  
  
 Sites may retrieve the distribution in one of the following ways:
  
 (1)  The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
         download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the software distribution file from the first
      available FTP Server.
  
 (2)  Sites may also elect to retrieve the software directly from a
      specific Server as follows:
  
  CIO Field Office      FTP Address                  Directory
  ----------------      -----------                  ---------

  Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov      [anonymous.software]
  Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov        [anonymous.software]
  
      The following file will be available:
  
        File Name            Description
        ---------            -----------
