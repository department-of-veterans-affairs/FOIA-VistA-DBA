 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 HD96622   Cancel/Restore Clinic Availability problems
  
    Problem 1:
    ----------
    When using the Cancel Clinic Availability option, the user is able to
    enter cancellation time periods that overlap a previously canceled
    time period.  This causes problems if time periods are restored.
    Ex. User entered cancel period from 9:00-11:00.  It is now possible
        to enter another cancel period from 8:00-12:00, which includes
        the previously cancelled period. 
  
    Resolution 1:
    -------------
    Modify routine SDC2 to prevent a subsequent time period from 
    wrapping around a previously cancelled time period.
  
  
    Problem 2:
    ----------
    When a clinic has several cancellations and restorations, as well as 
    scheduled appointments (both normal and overbooked), a problem occurs 
    where the last "[" is removed from the clinic's schedule grid.  This 
    prevents restoring availability or the schedule grid to display 
    correctly.
  
    Resolution 2:
    -------------
    Modify SDUNC to check that a single "[" remains in the grid for the 
    date when using Restore Clinic Availability (the same feature used in
    Cancel Clinic Availability).

       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you

       Global.
