Description:
============

 With the release of Scheduling patch SD*5.3*292, two new menu options 
 were distributed to sites. The two menu options use a stop code exclusion
 table to screen out encounters that are not to be included in the
 denominator when calculating compliance rate percentages for the
 performance measure.
  
 The exclusion table used by the application is included in this patch
 description.
