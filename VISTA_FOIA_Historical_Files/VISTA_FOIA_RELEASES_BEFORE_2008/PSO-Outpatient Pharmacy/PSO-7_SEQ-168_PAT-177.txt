Description:
============

                                       
 1)SBY-0203-31532
  While going through the option to finish an Outpatient Pharmacy Order
  [PSO LMOE FINISH], if the PATIENT STATUS (#3) field in the PRESCRIPTION FILE
  (#52) is left blank the first time it is asked for, it will prompt for
  the patient status again. If the user doesn't enter the patient status the
  second time, an error is generated. This patch will resolve this problem.
 
 2)HUN-0304-21898 
  The LABEL/PROFILE MONITOR MAX (#109) field in the OUTPATIENT SITE file
  (#59) has 250 as the minimum value, but the software that uses that field 
  sets the minimum value to 1000.  Each time the printer is used, an entry is
  made in the LABEL/PROFILE MONITOR MAX (#109) field in the OUTPATIENT SITE file 
  (#59) and if the monitor holds more entries than specified by this parameter, 
  the oldest entry is deleted. The documentation and field specifications for
  LABEL/PROFILE MONITOR MAX (#109) field in the OUTPATIENT SITE file ( #59) 
  allows you to enter a minimum value of 250. The field specification and file 
  manager documentation will be changed to allow a minimum value of 1000.
