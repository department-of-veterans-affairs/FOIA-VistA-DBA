============

 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
 This IB patch IB*2.0*234 addresses changes required by the Combat 
 Veterans Interim Solution - Phase I (CVIS) project. 
 The patch DG*5.3*528 has been designed as the Registration portion of CVIS
 project and is introducing a new API call $$CVEDT^DGCV  (see Integration 
 Agreement #4156) that returns the COMBAT VETERAN status for the patient 
 on the date of service.
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 This INTEGRATED BILLING patch modifies the IB software to implement the 
 following requirements specified for CVIS phase I project:
  
 1) Identify the CV in the Outpatient Registration Events Report
 This functional requirement shall modify the Outpatient/Registration 
 Events [IB Output Events Report] to include the veteran CV status.
 - add the CV flag on the name line.
 - modify the code to display the message "Veteran has CV status until 
 <expiration date>." if necessary.
  
 2) Identify the CV in the Disposition Special Inpatient Billing option
 This functional requirement shall modify the Disposition Special 
 Inpatient [IB MT Disp Special Cases] option to include the veteran CV 
 status.
 - modify help text to include CV status.
 - modify the code to display CV flag or "COMBAT VETERAN" message in all 
 appropriate lines.
 - produce CV bulletins to notify user about any admission or discharge 
 events for the CV patient.
  
 3) Identify the CV in the List Special Inpatient Billing Cases option
 - modify the code to display CV flag or "COMBAT VETERAN" message in all 
 appropriate lines.
  
 4) Provide Message to Alert Staff on charges generated for a Veteran with 
 CV Status 
 - create a new temporary mail group IB COMBAT VET RX COPAY
 - create a MailMan message to be delivered to the new (temporary) e-mail 
 group named IB COMBAT VET RX COPAY.
 NOTE: The mail group should contain billing and pharmacy staff.  This 
 manual alert process will be automated via the CV "full" solution project
 --- but for now --- the staff will get e-mails to direct them to Rx CoPay 
 charges that need reviewing. The staff must determine whether the charge
 is valid or not and take appropriate action (i.e. cancel inappropriate Rx 
 CoPay charges).
