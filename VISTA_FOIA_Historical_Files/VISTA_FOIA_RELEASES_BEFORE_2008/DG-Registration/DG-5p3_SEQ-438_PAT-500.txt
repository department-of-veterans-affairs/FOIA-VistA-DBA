Subject: PREVENT ENTRY OF DATA INTO RACE FIELD

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  In an attempt to prevent further data from being entered into the historical
  RACE field (#.06) of the PATIENT file (#2), the input transform of the RACE
  field has been modified to always kill X.
  
  
  POST-INIT:
  ==========
  The post-init contained in this patch will scan through the PATIENT file
  (#2) searching for entries that do not have appropriate values in the
  RACE field (#.06).  Entries that do not have appropriate values will have
  the value deleted from the RACE field.  This post-init is done as part of
  the KIDS installation (i.e. it is not seperately tasked off) and will print
  progress information for every 1000th entry checked.
