Subject: DELETION OF 2 LEGACY DOMAINS IN FILE #537025

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 
     In addition to the sites that were listed in patch AFJX*5.1*21,
    2 sites were added to this list.  These sites are Syracuse and
    Lincoln.
 
    Some sites have been mistakenly sending NHE requests to legacy
    sites.  MailMan patches XM*DBA*141 (10/3/00) closed the legacy
    sites and thus the legacy sites no longer receive mail. The
    legacy sites therefore do not respond to the NHE requests.
 
    1. All sites must send NHE requests to primary sites only.
 
    2. All sites must delete legacy sites from their NHE Authorized
    Site File #537025.
 
    This patch lists the legacy domains and the procedure to be used
    to delete legacy domains in the NHE Authorized Site File
    (537025).  This patch is for Medical Centers only.  Database
    sites such as Austin, HEC, FMS, etc. should disregard this patch.
 
 
  Background:
  When two or more VA Medical Center facilities integrate their
  databases, the legacy facilities become DIVISIONS of the primary
  facility.  The "new" facility's station number is the primary
  facility's "old" station number. New station numbers are NOT
  assigned/issued.  Because of the integration, the legacy facilities
  no longer receive mail or Network Health Exchange transmissions from
  other facilities.  All transmissions are received on the primary
  facility.
   
 
  General:
  This patch lists Legacy Domains and the procedure to be used to
  delete their domains in the Network Health Exchange Authorized Site
  File #537025.
   
  Once these domains have been deleted, any Network Health Exchange
  requests must be sent to the primary facility.
   
 
 
  Instructions:

  If you are an integrated facility, the primary facility should not
  close the domains of its legacy facilities. The left column shows the
  domain to close.  If your site's domain is the primary domain (shown
  in the right column) for that legacy domain, do not close the legacy
  domain.
 
 
   
  Using the example, close the following Legacy domains:
   
 
     Close Legacy Domain        Primary Domain (should not close Legacy)
