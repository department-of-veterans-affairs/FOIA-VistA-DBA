Subject: GWOT COMBAT VET QUESTION

Category:

  - Other

Description:
============

  Based upon the recommendations from the Task Force on Returning Global 
  War on Terror Heroes Report, the Congressional Budget Office is  
  requesting IT enhancement to the electronic enrollment process that 
  presumes the care provided to combat veterans is related to the combat 
  experience. 
  
  This will involve modifications to several VistA applications when 
  a provider is prompted to respond whether the care being delivered 
  is related to combat service.
  
  The modifications will result in a change that will presume combat 
  experience to assure that combat veterans do not pay co-payments for  
  health care provided for care of combat-related conditions.
  It will also eliminate the need for VA providers to annotate that each 
  episode of care was related to combat experience, 
  saving time and provider resources.

  NATURE OF PROBLEM:
  =================
  
  The Registration package accepts and retains veteran information 
  concerning OEF/OIF eligibility, dates of combat, and date of discharge.
  The number of veterans being treated for combat related injuries is  
  increasing, and is being monitored by the White House and Congress. 
  Currently, when a combat veteran receives health care services, the VA
  provider must make the determination at each episode of care that the 
  care provided is related to the combat experience of the OEF/OIF veteran.
  Several applications prompt a user during the completion of orders and
  encounters with this question which must be answered before the encounter
  or requested service will become active. An affirmative response exempts
  the veteran from any co-payments for services rendered. Presently the
  default is "NULL"  and must be answered by a mouse click in the case of
  graphical user interface (GUI) applications such as CPRS, or entry of
  either "YES" or "NO" in the roll and scroll applications such as
  Outpatient Pharmacy.  It is believed that the current process results 
  in an undercount of veterans receiving combat related care. This request 
  is to change the default "NULL" response to "YES".
  
  
  RESOLUTION:
  ===========
  OR*3*277 (CPRS GUI v26.76) will:
  
  1. Change the default to "YES" when the combat veteran indicator is 
     initially displayed in the CPRS GUI application, via the sign orders, 
     encounter and reminders forms.
  2. Allow the provider to deselect the default in CPRS GUI.
  3. Modify roll and scroll applications to include a default of 
     "Yes" when the "Was this related to combat?" question is asked. 
  4. Allow the provider to overwrite the default "Yes" with a "No" in 
     roll and scroll applications.
  5. CPRS conditionally registers the following RPCs to OR CPRS GUI CHART 
     if MAG*3.0*7 and MAG*3.0*37 have been installed on the system.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   
  Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.  
  This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
  disruption. Installation should take approximately 1 minute.
   
  1.  Read the above section "INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES" and take
      appropriate actions.
   
  2.  Obtain the file OR_30_277.KID.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
      select the Installation menu.
   
  4.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_277.KID when prompted to Enter
      a Host File name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*277):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
   
  6.  When ready, select the Install Packages option (when prompted for

  13. Retrieve and open the file OR_30_277.ZIP.
   
  14. Note the file date/time inside the ZIP for CPRSChart.EXE.  Move this 
      file to the appropriate directory where it can be accessed by all
      CPRS workstations.  After moving the files, compare the file
      date/time of the extracted copy to that contained in the ZIP.
      They should be the same. Some ZIP extraction utilities may produce
      extracted files with the current date/time.  If this is the case,
      the CPRSUpdate application may not function correctly.
