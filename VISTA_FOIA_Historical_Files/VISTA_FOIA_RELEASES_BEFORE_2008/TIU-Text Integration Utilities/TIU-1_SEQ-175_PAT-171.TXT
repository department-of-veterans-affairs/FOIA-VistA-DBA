Subject: New SCI Document Definitions

Category:

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to install entries into the TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITION file (8925.1) in order to meet the requirements of the Spinal Cord 
 Injury package. The added Document Class, Document Titles and Objects are 
 all national entries.  Subsequent installs of this patch will check to see 
 if each entry already exists in file 8925.1, and if they do exist the
 installation will not install a new entry.
 
 This patch adds the following 21 new entries into the TIU DOCUMENT
 DEFINITION file (8925.1):
