Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch enhances the payment messages that are sent from VistA Fee 
 Basis to Central FEE (Austin) to include additional data elements.  These
 changes were requested by the VISN Support Service Center (VSSC) and the
 Fee Program Office to improve tracking and evaluation of the Fee program
 and the cost of non-VA care.
  
 The Queue Data for Transmission [FBAA QUEUE DATA FOR TRANS.] option is 
 used to build and transmit messages to Central FEE.  This patch changes
 the payment messages that are generated by this option as described below.
  
 1. Include the following data elements in the B9 (Inpatient) payment 
    message:
    a. Admission Date
    b. Discharge Date
    c. Date of Birth
    d. Disposition type
       Add 100 to the disposition type code for CNH (contract nursing home)
       to differentiate from the code that is used for CH (civil hospital).
    e. Volume Indicator (Days of Care)
    f. Authorized/Unauthorized Flag 
    g. Adjustment Reason Code
    h. Adjustment Amount
    i. Placeholder for future NPI (national provider identifier)
  
 2. Include the following data elements in the B3 (Outpatient/Ancillary)
    payment message:
    a. Admission date (only when associated with authorized CH and CNH)
    b. Date of Birth
    c. Volume Indicator (Units Paid)
    d. Authorized/Unauthorized Flag 
    e. Up to 4 CPT Modifiers
    f. Up to 2 Adjustment Reason Codes
    g. Up to 2 Adjustment Amounts
    h. Placeholder for future NPI
  
 3. Include the following data elements in the B5 (Pharmacy) payment 
    message:
    a. Up to 2 Adjustment Reason Codes
    b. Up to 2 Adjustment Amounts
    c. Placeholder for future NPI
  
 4. Expand the length of Veteran Name to 30 characters for B9 (Inpatient),
    B3 (Outpatient Ancillary), B5 (Pharmacy), and BT (Travel) payment
    messages.
  
 5. Modify the date format used on all four payment batch types to include
    four digit years.
  
 6. Include two space characters as a filler before the following data
    elements for B9 (Inpatient) payment message:
    a. Payment Amount Approved
    b. NVH-Amount-Claimed
    c. NVH-Pricer-Amount
    d. Adjustment Amount
