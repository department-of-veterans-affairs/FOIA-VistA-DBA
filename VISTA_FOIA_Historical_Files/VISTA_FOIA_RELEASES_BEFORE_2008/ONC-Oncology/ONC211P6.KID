A person of mixed parentage is classified according to the race of his
"^DD",160,160,8,21,2,0)
nonwhite parent.  Mixtures of nonwhite races are generally classified
"^DD",160,160,8,21,3,0)
according to the race of the father.
"^DD",160,160,8,21,4,0)
 
"^DD",160,160,8,21,5,0)
This field is used in conjunction with 'Ethnicity' which identifies
"^DD",160,160,8,21,6,0)

 "What is a Diagnosis of Cancer?"
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,2,0)
 ================================
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,3,0)
The simplest way to state the answer is that a patient has cancer if a
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,4,0)
recognized medical practitioner says so.  Then the question changes to
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,5,0)
"How can one tell from the medical record that the physician has
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,6,0)
stated a cancer diagnosis?"  In most cases the patient's record
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,7,0)
clearly presents the diagnosis by use of specific terms which are
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,8,0)
synonymous with cancer.  However, not always is the physician certain
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,9,0)
or the recorded language definitive.  SEER rules concerning the usage
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,10,0)
of vague or inconclusive diagnostic language are as follows:
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,11,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,12,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,13,0)
 The ambiguous terms "probable", "suspect", "suspicious",
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,14,0)
 "compatible with", or "consistent with" ARE considered to be
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,15,0)
 diagnostic of cancer.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,16,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,17,0)
 The ambiguous terms "questionable", "possible", "suggests", or
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,18,0)
 "equivocal", ARE NOT considered to be diagnostic of cancer.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,19,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,20,0)
 "How Changeable are the Diagnostic Items?"
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,21,0)
 ==========================================
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,22,0)
Most of the diagnostic information items are restricted to information
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,23,0)
available or procedures performed within the time limits defined for
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,24,0)
each item.  However, with the passage of time the patient's medical
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,25,0)
record gets more complete in regard to information originally missing
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,26,0)
or uncertain.  It is therefore established practice to accept the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,27,0)
thinking and information about the case at the time of the latest
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,28,0)
submission, or the most complete or detailed information.  Thus, there
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,29,0)
may be changes in the coding of primary site, histology, extent of
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,30,0)
disease, residence, etc., as the information becomes more certain.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,31,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,32,0)
There may be cases reported originally as cancer, especially if the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,33,0)
initial report was a death certificate or one with the ambiguous
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,34,0)
terms, listed previously, which later information indicates never was a
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,35,0)
malignancy.  These cases must be deleted from the file and the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,36,0)
sequence number of any remaining cases for the same person adjusted
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,37,0)

The determination of how many primary cancers a patient has is, of
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,69,0)
course, a medical decision, but operational rules are needed in order
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,70,0)
to ensure consistency of reporting by all participants.  Basic factors
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,71,0)
include the site of origin, the date of diagnosis, the histologic
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,72,0)
type, the behavior of the neoplasm (i.e., in situ vs. malignant), and
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,73,0)
laterality.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,74,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,75,0)
In general, if there is a difference in the site where the cancer
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,76,0)
originates, it is fairly easy to determine whether it is a separate
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,77,0)
primary, regardless of dates of detection and of differences in
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,78,0)
histology.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,79,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,80,0)
Likewise, if there is a clear-cut difference in histology, other data
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,81,0)
such as site and time of detection are not essential.  In some
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,82,0)
neoplasms, however, one must be careful since different histologic
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,83,0)
terms are used to describe progressive stages or phases of the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,84,0)
same disease process.

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,90,0)
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 1976 (ICD-O, 1976) is
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,91,0)
considered to be a separate site.  For all other sites, each category
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,92,0)
(3-digits) as delineated in ICD-O, 1976, is considered to be a

separate site.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,94,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,95,0)
For example:  Transverse colon (ICD-O code C18.4) and descending
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,96,0)
colon (C18.6) are each considered to be separate sites while

trigone of urinary bladder (C67.0) and lateral wall of urinary bladder
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,98,0)
(C67.2) are considered to be subsites of the urinary bladder
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,99,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,110,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,111,0)
1.  A single lesion of one histologic type is considered a single primary
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,112,0)
even if the lesion crosses site boundaries.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,113,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,114,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,117,0)
3.  If a new cancer of the same histology as an earlier one is
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,118,0)
diagnosed in the same site within two months, consider this to be the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,119,0)
same primary cancer.  If a new cancer of the same histology is diagnosed in
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,120,0)
the same site after two months, consider this new cancer a
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,121,0)

   a.  Simultaneous multiple lesions of the same histologic type within the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,131,0)
same site will be considered a single primary.  Further, if one lesion
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,132,0)
has a behavior code of in situ and another a behavior code of malignant,
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,133,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,140,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,141,0)
   a.  Multiple lesions of different histologic types within a single
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,142,0)
site are to be considered separate primaries whether occurring
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,143,0)
simultaneously or at different times.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,144,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,145,0)
   b.  Multiple lesions of different histologic types occurring in
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,146,0)
different sites are considered separate primaries whether occurring
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,147,0)
simultaneously or at different times.  The following are exceptions to

this rule:
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,149,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,150,0)
      a).  For multiple lesions within a single site occurring within two
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,151,0)
months, if one lesion is stated to be (adeno)carcinoma, NOS and the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,152,0)
second lesion is stated to be a more specific (adeno)carcinoma,
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,153,0)
consider this to be a single primary and code to the more specific
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,154,0)
(adeno)carcinoma.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,155,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,156,0)
Exception:  When both an "adenocarcinoma" and "adenocarcinoma
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,157,0)
in an adenomatous polyp" arise in the same segment of the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,158,0)
colon within two months of diagnosis, code as "adenocarcinoma"
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,159,0)
(8140/39).
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,160,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,161,0)
      b).  Within each breast, - combinations of ductal and lobular
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,162,0)
carcinoma occurring within two months of each other are to be
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,163,0)
considered a single primary and the histology coded acording
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,164,0)
to the ICD-O, FT, 1987.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,165,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,166,0)
Note:  If the ductal and lobular lesions for the female breast
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,167,0)
are reported to occur in different quadrants of the same
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,168,0)
breast, the appropriate site code is 'C50.9'.  If the ductal
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,169,0)
lesion occurs in one breast and the lobular lesion occurs in
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,170,0)
the opposite breast, these are considered to be two primaries
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,171,0)
whether diagnosed within two months or not.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,172,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,173,0)
      c).  Some tumors have more than one histologic pattern.  The most
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,174,0)
frequent combinations are listed in ICD-O, FT, 1987, under the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,175,0)
term "mixed" in the alphabetic index.  In addition combination
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,176,0)
terms such as "adenosquamous carcinoma (8560/3)" or "small
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,177,0)
cell-large cell carcinoma (8045/3)" are included.  Any of these
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,178,0)
mixed histologies are to be considered one primary.  Refer to
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,179,0)
the rule on "Compound Morphologic Diagnoses" (pg. xviii, ICD-O,
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,180,0)
1976) for rules on coding compound morphologic diagnoses or
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,181,0)
diagnoses including modifying adjectives which have different
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,182,0)
code numbers.  For a diagnosis with two modifying adjectives,
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,183,0)
consider this to be one primary and code to the higher
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,184,0)
histology.

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,186,0)
6.  If only one histologic type is reported and if both sides of a
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,187,0)
paired site are involved within two months of diagnosis, a
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,188,0)
determination must be made as to whether the patient has one or two
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,189,0)
independent primaries.  If it is determined that there are two
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,190,0)
independent primaries, two records are to be submitted, each with
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,191,0)
the appropriate laterality and extent of disease information.  If
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,192,0)
it is determined that there is only one primary, laterality should
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,193,0)
be coded according to the side in which the single primary
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,194,0)
originated and a single record submitted.  If it is impossible to
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,195,0)
tell in which of the pair the single primary originated,
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,196,0)
laterality should be coded as a '4' and a single record submitted.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,197,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,198,0)
There are THREE EXCEPTIONS to this rule.  Simultaneous bilateral
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,199,0)
involvement of the ovaries in which only a single histology is
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,200,0)
to be considered one primary and laterality is to be coded '4'.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,201,0)
Bilateral retinoblastomas and bilateral Wilms's tumor are always
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,202,0)
considered single primaries (whether simultaneous or not), and
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,203,0)
laterality is coded as '4'.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,204,0)

"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,205,0)
7.  Kaposi's sarcoma (9140/3) is considered a systemic disease

See the tables in the SEER manual to determine multiple primaries
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,212,0)
of the lymphatic and hematopoietic diseases.  To use these tables locate
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,213,0)
the first diagnosis in the left column of the table, then locate the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,214,0)
second diagnosis in the other columns.  If the second primary appears in the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,215,0)
middle column, the two diagnoses are usually considered two
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,216,0)
separate primaries.  If the second diagnosis appears in the rightmost
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,217,0)
column, then the two diagnoses are usually considered one primary.  If
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,218,0)
the pathology report specifically states differently, use the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,219,0)
pathology report.  Consult your medical advisor or pathologist if
"^DD",165.5,165.5,.01,21,220,0)

The diagnosis date refers to the first diagnosis of this cancer by any
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,2,0)
recognized medical practitioner.  This is often a clinical diagnosis
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,3,0)
and may not ever be confirmed histologically.  Even if confirmed
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,4,0)
later, the diagnosis date refers to the date of the first clinical
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,5,0)
diagnosis and not to the date of confirmation.  If upon medical and/or
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,6,0)
pathological review of a previous condition the patient is deemed to
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,7,0)
have had cancer at an earlier date, then the earlier date is the date
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,8,0)
of diagnosis, i.e., the date of diagnosis is back-dated.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,9,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,10,0)
The date of diagnosis for "Death Certificate Only" cases is the date
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,11,0)
of death.  The date of diagnosis for "Autopsy Only" cases is also the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,12,0)
date of death.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,13,0)

In the absence of an exact date of diagnosis, make the best approximation.

If the only information is "Spring of," "Middle of the year," "Fall,"
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,16,0)
approximate these as April, July, and October respectively.  For
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,17,0)
"Winter of" it is important to determine whether the beginning or end
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,18,0)
of the year is meant before approximating the month.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,19,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,20,0)
If there is no basis for approximation of month, simply enter the year.

The Topography section of the International Classification of Diseases
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,4,0)
for Oncology (ICD-O, 1990) is used for coding the Primary Site of all
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,5,0)
cancers reported to SEER.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,6,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,7,0)
Site codes may be found in the Topography, Numerical List section
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,8,0)
(pages 1-19) in ICD-O, 1976 or in Alphabetic Index (pages 35-128)
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,9,0)
of ICD-O, FT, 1987 which includes both Topography and Morphology
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,10,0)
terms.  In the Alphabetic Index all site (Topography) codes are indicated
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,11,0)
by a 'T-' preceding the code number.  The 'T-' should not be coded.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,12,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,13,0)
For example:  A patient's record states the primary site is "cardia of
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,14,0)
stomach."  This site is looked up in the Alphabetic Index, either
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,15,0)
under "cardia" or "stomach" and is found to be T-151.0.  In coding for
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,16,0)
SEER, drop the T-, then enter the code '151.0'.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,17,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,18,0)
In the Introduction of ICD-O, 1976 (page xvii), the topic of "Site-
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,19,0)
Specific Morphology Terms" is discussed.  If the patient record has
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,20,0)
a morphologic term with a 'T-' number listed in ICD-O, 1976, use this
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,21,0)
"T-" number if no definite site is given or if only a metastatic site
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,22,0)
is given.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,23,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,24,0)
For example:  If the diagnosis is hepatoma (8170/3) with no other
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,25,0)
statement about topography, code primary site as '155.0' (liver) since
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,26,0)
this morphology is always indicative of a primary malignancy in the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,27,0)
liver.
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,28,0)
 
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,29,0)
Leukemia is coded to bone marrow '169.1' since blood cells originate

"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,32,0)
Lymphomas originating in lymph nodes are coded to lymph nodes.  If an
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,33,0)
extranodal site is designated as the primary, code to this site.  For
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,34,0)
example, a malignant lymphoma of the stomach is coded to stomach.  Be
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,35,0)
sure this is the primary site of origin and not only a site where the
"^DD",165.5,165.5,20,21,36,0)
