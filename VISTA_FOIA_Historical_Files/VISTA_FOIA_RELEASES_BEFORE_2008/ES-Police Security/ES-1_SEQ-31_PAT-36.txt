 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
    Problem:
    ________
  
    The problem reported in NOIS NYN-1198-12595 and SBY-0501-31458 is that
    the first page of the Uniform Offense Report (ESP PRINT OFFENSE REPORT)
    is blank when printed.
    
    Resolution:
    ___________
  
    When the print file opens, a TOF (top of form) command is executed. Then, 
    when the program begins to print, it also executes a TOF via the HDR
    (header subroutine), resulting in a blank page. This patch changes the
    program to not do a TOF command if printing the first page.
    
                    **********NOTE*************
  
    This option is very dependent on the terminal type set up at each site.
    This patch does not change that. If the terminal is not specified 
    correctly at the site, other problems may be seen. For example, during
    testing for this patch, when using terminal type P-REMOTE TCP 10/6/UP,
    errors such as printing only one line on the second page occurred. But
    when terminal type P-REMOTE TCP 10/6/UP LM 10 was used, all went well.

 This patch should be loaded  during non-peak hours to minimize
 disruption to users.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
   
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                               ---
                                                                
           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution 
           Backup a Transport Global  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*36):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*36.
  
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
          YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated).
      b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? YES//', answer NO.

  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
     
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
