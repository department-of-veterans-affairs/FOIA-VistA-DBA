Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*320 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA  
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*320 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*320 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none. 
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes made,
 no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation of 
 this patch.
 ***********************************************************************
 
 The EPI Historical Reseeding patch, LR*5.2*320, contains modifications to the
 Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) software that corrects fatal errors
 received during the historical reseeding of the EPI data.  Sites were
 receiving fatal errors from Austin that caused their data to be rejected.
 The modifications included in this patch are:
 
 1) Test patients are not included in the EPI data sent to Austin.
 
 2) A string length error was fixed, MERGEOUT+34^HLTF2:1,%DSM-E-STRLEN. 
 This error was due to PID segments that were over 245 characters long.
 
 3) The 410 errors, discharge date after processing date, was corrected.  
 This problem was due to patients with a future discharge date.  This patch 
 resolves this problem by not sending the discharge date to Austin if the 
 discharge date is greater than the last day of the month of the extracted 
 data.
 
 4) An undefined error is fixed.  In the Print Detailed Verification Report 
 [LREPI VERIFICATION REPORT] option an undefined error occurs when an "^" is 
 entered at the "Select Pathogen: " prompt.
 
 5) The 605 errors are corrected.  This problem was due to a missing date in 
 the BACT RPT DATE APPROVED (#11 ) field of MICROBIOLOGY (#63.05) subfile of 
 LAB DATA (#63) file for organism IDs and a "0" was being sent to Austin.  This
 patch resolves this problem by sending a blank field when the completed 
 date is missing instead of "0".
 
 6) A processing routine was added to LREPI CLIENT protocol.  This resolves 
 missing processing routine HL7 errors.
 
 If your site received one of the above errors, string length error, 410 
 error or 605 error, you will need to retransmit the months with these 
 errors following the installation of this patch.
 
 Extended transmission dates:
 Sites in VISNs with even numbers can continue to transmit on Monday & 
 Friday during PM hours (September 10, 13, 17, 20, 24 and 27)
 and Sundays (September 12, 19, and 26).
 
 Sites in VISNs with odd numbers can continue to transmit on Tuesday and 
 Thursday during PM hours (September 9, 14, 16, 21, 23, 28, and 30) and 
 Saturdays (September 11, 18, and 25).

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport   
       global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify 
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the   
       following options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a 
       Transport Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the  
       routines in your production account to the routines in the patch  
       by using the 'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' 
       option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*320'.
  
       If prompted ' Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? YES//' choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?  
       YES// ' choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
   
   7.  Routine LR320 will be automatically deleted by the software upon
       installation of the patch.
