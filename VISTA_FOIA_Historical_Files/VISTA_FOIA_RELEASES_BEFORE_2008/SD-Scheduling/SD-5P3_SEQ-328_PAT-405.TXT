Subject: ACRP TRANSMISSION HISTORY RPT USING EXCESS DISK SPACE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will change the logic within the Ambulatory Care Transmission 
 History Report (Full) to prevent the report from being run multiple times 
 simultaneously by the same user within the same account session.
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS:
 ================

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 SFC-1104-61323   ACRP TRANSMISSION HISTORY RPT Using Excess Disk Space
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When the Ambulatory Care Transmission History Report is started more
   than once by the same user, within the same account session, it can
   end up using excess disk space and possibly cause a system crash.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   New code will be added to routine SCDXPRN2, which will prevent this
   report from being started by the same user if it is currently running
   or queued to be run by that user.  However, other system users will
   still be able to run the report.
