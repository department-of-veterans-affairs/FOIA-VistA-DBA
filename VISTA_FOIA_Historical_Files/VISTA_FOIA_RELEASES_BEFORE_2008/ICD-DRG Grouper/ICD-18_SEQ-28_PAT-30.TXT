Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects certain DRG calculations.
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 ========================== 
 1) HD 160982 - DRG's are wrong (according to Lead Coder)
 2) HD 196966 - Procedures not grouping to 573 like they should

 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Cheyenne, WY
 Connecticut HCS
 Cincinnati, OH
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) HD 160982 - DRG's are wrong (according to Lead Coder)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of procedures 00.66 in conjunction with 37.71 & 37.81
 is yielding DRG 555 instead of DRG 551.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine ICDTLB6C has been modified to use DRG 551 because 
 it is higher in the surgical hierarchy than DRG 555.
  
 2) HD 196966 - Procedures not grouping to 573 like they should
  
 a) Problem:
 ===========
 Use of procedure 56.51 in conjunction with 57.71 
 is yielding DRG 303 instead of DRG 573.
  
 a) Solution:
 ============
 Routine ICDDRG0 has been modified to call routine ICDDRG11
 which will use DRG 573 because it is higher in the surgical 
 hierarchy than DRG 303.
  
 b) Problem:
 ===========
 Dx codes 824.2 with 799.02 and procedure 79.36 is yielding 
 DRG 219 instead of 218.
  
 b) Solution:
 ============
 Routine ICD1830G will correct Dx 799.02 to be a complication/
 comorbidity thus yielding DRG 218.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
 be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 Please ensure that your programming variables are set, 
 including your DUZ(0)="@", otherwise installation will abort.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
            will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
            need to repeat this step.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*30):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*30.
  
 5.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted,' Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond Yes.
  
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
     enter:
             PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
     When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     press enter.
  
 7.  Routines ICD1830* can be deleted after the patch has been
     successfully installed.
  
 8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] option in order to make the transfer
     DRGs correspond to the appropriate grouper.  This option 
     updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records opened during
     the current fiscal year (since 10/1/2007).
     The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
     is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
     current FY.
