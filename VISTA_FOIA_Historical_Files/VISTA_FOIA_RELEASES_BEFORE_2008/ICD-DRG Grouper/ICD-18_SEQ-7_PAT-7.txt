   This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
   Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
   routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
   the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
   implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
   and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
   This patch is contained in the MULTIPLE BUILD DISTRIBUTION:
     CSV MS 1.0
 
   Installing the CSV MS 1.0 build provides all of the updates
   listed below.  Sites will use the Multi-Build Distribution to
   ensure the proper order of installation for the VISTA Packages
   in the Management Systems Product Line.

 I. OVERVIEW
 ---------------------
 
 Gail Graham, Director of Information Assurance, requested modifications to the
 VHA Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) Patient
 Information Management System (PIMS) package that allows the use of multiple
 versions of the code sets employed in financial transactions.  The Health
 Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPPA) stipulates that diagnostic
 and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes that were
 applicable at the time the service was provided.  This initiative is commonly
 referred to as the Code Set Versioning (CSV) project.  For this project, four
 code sets required by HIPPA legislation are date sensitive and needed
 modification.  These include:
 * International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modifications (ICD-9-CM)
 * Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) codes, which is part of the ICD-9 code set
 * Clinical Procedure Terminology-4 (CPT-4), and
 * Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) Level II Codes.
 
 This patch addresses the changes done within the DRG Grouper package in
 compliance to the specifications of CSV. Modifications were done within the
 DRG Grouper application to assure the validity of CPT codes, ICD diagnosis and
 CPT procedure codes, and DRG codes, by utilizing API's that return codes for a
 given date.  In the case of DRG codes, new API's were created to return the
 correct codes for a given date. New fields were also added to the DRG file
 (#80.2) to accommodate the new information required for CSV. This included
 adding an inactive flag, active date, and inactive date to the .01 level of
 the file and creating a new effective date multiple level that contains the
 status flag for the effective date along with the MDC# and Surgery flag. A
 string of DRG codes were also added to the effective date multiple field in
 the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1) and the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80).
 This consisted of DRGa through DRGf fields added.
 
 II. TECHNICAL
 
 a. All Direct Global Accesses (DGA's) to the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file
 (#80.1) or the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) were changed to use newly-developed
 Application Program Interfaces (API's). The API's are passed the ICD/CPT code
 and the "effective date" and the proper information is returned. These new
 API's also check to verify that the ICD/CPT code is active for the given date.
 
 b. All DGA's to the DRG file (#80.2) were changed to use a newly-developed
 API. These API's determine the correct DRG code for the effective date and
 verify that the DRG code is active for the given date
 
 c. The following new fields were added to the EFFECTIVE DATE multiple (#66) of
 both the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1)
 -
 DRGa  (#60)
 DRGb  (#61)
 DRGc  (#62)
 DRGd  (#63)
 DRGe  (#64)
 DRGf   (#65)
 
 d. File #80.2 was updated to add an ACTIVATION DATE (14), INACTIVE (15), and
 INACTIVATION DATE (16) to the .01 level of the file.
 
 e. A new EFFECTIVE DATE multiple  (#66) was added to the DRG file (#80.2). 
 New fields within the multiple are -
 EFFECTIVE DATE  (#.01)
 STATUS  (#.03)
 MDC#  (#.05)
 SURGERY  (#.06)
 
 f. Post-Install Routine (ICD187PT) This routine:
    1. Populates the "DRG" level of the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) and the ICD
 OPERATION/PROCEDURE (#80.1) files. See (c) above. This data is taken from the
 existing DRG codes in the DRGa (#60) through DRGf (#65) data fields.
    2. Populates the EFFECTIVE DATE multiple (#66) in the DRG file (#80.2) See
 (e) above. The MDC# (#.05) is set equal to the MDC# field (#5) in the 0 node.
 and the SURGERY field (#.06) is set to the SURGERY field (#.06) in the 0 node. 
 STATUS and EFFECTIVE DATES are determined by the FISCAL YEAR ("FY") entries
 that already exist in the file. A WEIGHT of 0.00 in the FY entry will result
 in an EFFECTIVE DATE entry with a STATUS of INACTIVE, otherwise the STATUS
 will be ACTIVE.
 
 STATUS (#.03) has a default of ACTIVE and the EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) has a
 default of 10/1/82. If the DRG code has a WEIGHT (#2) of 0.0 then its STATUS
 (#.03) is INACTIVE and the EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01) is set to October 1 of the
 first Fiscal Year that has a WEIGHT of 0.0.
 
 III. Functional
 ---------
 * The users will be prompted for an "effective date" when calculating the DRG
 using the DRG Grouper
 * All calculations of ICD/CPT/DRG codes will be based on an effective date
 that was either entered by the user or extracted from the patient's data
 
 EXAMPLES
 
 Run the DRG Grouper menu option.
 The first question now is "Effective Date" (with the default of today). 
 If you want to calculate the DRG for a date other than today, enter that date.
 All other functionality is the same. The DRG will be calculated using the
 entered date.
