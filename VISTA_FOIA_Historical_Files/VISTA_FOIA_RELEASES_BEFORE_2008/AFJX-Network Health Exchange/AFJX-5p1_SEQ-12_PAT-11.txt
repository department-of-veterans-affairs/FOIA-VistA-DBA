Subject: Correcting dates to prevent records getting purged

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

     Due to patches for Y2K compliance, Network Health Exchange is
  changing its code.  Currently, NHE is reading the dates
  incorrectly.  Routines were modified to resolve the extraction of
  dates from the records correctly.
   
   
   
    NOIS:  SBY-0598-30445, CMO-0698-42277
      Sites reported that valid records were purged by the Network
  Health Exchange Nightly Purge.  Due to NHE reading incorrect
  dates, valid records were deleted.  Records that are 7 days old
  are to be kept not purged.
   
   
   
    Test Sites:
    ===========
        Columbia, Salisbury

    Installation Instructions:
    ==========================
   
     1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation;
        however, it is highly recommended to do the installation
        when a minimal number of users are on the system.
     2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.
     3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? Yes// <return>, respond YES. When prompted to select
                                               ===
        the option(s) you would like to place out of order, enter the
        following:
   
           AFJXNHEX REQUEST
           ================
   
     4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in
        the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they
        should be unmapped at this time.
     5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
     7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu, you may elect
        to use the following options:
        a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the Transport Global.
        b. Print Transport Global and Compare Transport Global to the
           Current System - this option will allow you to view all
           changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It
           compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
           templates, etc.).
   
        c. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
   
           AFJX*5.1*11.
           ==========
   
     8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 4, the mapped set
        should be rebuilt once the installation has run to completion.
