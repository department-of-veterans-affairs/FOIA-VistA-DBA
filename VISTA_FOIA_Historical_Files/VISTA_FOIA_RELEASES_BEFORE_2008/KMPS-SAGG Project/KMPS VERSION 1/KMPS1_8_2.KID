Description: 
"BLD",505,1,2,0)
============
"BLD",505,1,3,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,4,0)
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) to correct the
"BLD",505,1,5,0)
'Invalid reverse-path specification' transmission error within the
"BLD",505,1,6,0)
Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software package.
"BLD",505,1,7,0)
This patch release will also allow the collection routines to run on Cache
"BLD",505,1,8,0)
for OpenVMS platforms.
"BLD",505,1,9,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,10,0)
All DSM, Cache for Windows NT and Cache for OpenVMS sites are instructed
"BLD",505,1,11,0)
to install this patch.
"BLD",505,1,12,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,13,0)
The original 'Status of SAGG Collection Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] 
"BLD",505,1,14,0)
option has been renamed as the 'Check SAGG Environment' option.  In 
"BLD",505,1,15,0)
addition to providing the previous information regarding the SAGG 
"BLD",505,1,16,0)
collection routines, this option will now check the status of SAGG patch 
"BLD",505,1,17,0)
installation at the site.
"BLD",505,1,18,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,19,0)
The local mail message that is generated when the the SAGG background 
"BLD",505,1,20,0)
routines complete their collection process has been enhanced to 
"BLD",505,1,21,0)
accommodate the expanded volume set names found on the Cache for OpenVMS 
"BLD",505,1,22,0)
and Cache for Windows NT platforms.  In addition, the local message will
"BLD",505,1,23,0)
recommend that the background job be run over the weekend hours if the job
"BLD",505,1,24,0)
is started during the weekday.
"BLD",505,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,26,0)
The pre-install routine of this patch will move mail members from the
"BLD",505,1,27,0)
KMPS-SAGG mail group to the KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  The KMP-CAPMAN
"BLD",505,1,28,0)
mail-group was created with the release of the Resource Usage Monitor
"BLD",505,1,29,0)
(RUM) package.  All SAGG notification messages will start utilizing the
"BLD",505,1,30,0)
KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  Any mail groups within the MAIL GROUP file that
"BLD",505,1,31,0)
have KMPS-SAGG as a MEMBER GROUP will have the KMPS-SAGG entry removed.
"BLD",505,1,32,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,33,0)
This patch will remove the KMPS-SAGG mail group from the MAIL GROUP file.
"BLD",505,1,34,0)
The 'Edit KMPS-SAGG Mail Group' [KMPS SAGG MAIL] option will be deleted.
"BLD",505,1,35,0)
Use the 'Capacity Management Mail Group Edit' [KMP MAIL GROUP EDIT] option
"BLD",505,1,36,0)
to change the the membership of the mail group that will receive package
"BLD",505,1,37,0)
notification messages.
"BLD",505,1,38,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,39,0)
This patch will now allow SAGG to accept alphanumeric characters within 
"BLD",505,1,40,0)
the site number.  This problem had effected the MPI facility located in
"BLD",505,1,41,0)
Austin.
"BLD",505,1,42,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,43,0)
This patch will enable the collection of hardware information from sites
"BLD",505,1,44,0)
running DSM.  The hardware information will consist of the hardware name 
"BLD",505,1,45,0)
(such as Compaq AlphaServer ES40) and the number of active cpu processors 
"BLD",505,1,46,0)
installed within each node.

Installation Steps:
"BLD",505,1,103,0)
===================
"BLD",505,1,104,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,105,0)
Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not 
"BLD",505,1,106,0)
currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the day
"BLD",505,1,107,0)
with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer than
"BLD",505,1,108,0)
10-15 minutes.  
"BLD",505,1,109,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,110,0)
   1.  Review the mail members of the KMPS-SAGG and KMP-CAPMAN mail groups
"BLD",505,1,111,0)
       with the FileMan Inquiry option. A pre-install routine will attempt
"BLD",505,1,112,0)
       to move mail members from the KMPS-SAGG mail group to the 
"BLD",505,1,113,0)
       KMP-CAPMAN mail group.
"BLD",505,1,114,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,115,0)
       Any mail members that are not automatically moved will need to be 
"BLD",505,1,116,0)
       entered manually with FileMan into the KMP-CAPMAN mail group after
"BLD",505,1,117,0)
       completion of the patch installation process.
"BLD",505,1,118,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,119,0)
       The patch will delete the KMPS-SAGG mail group during the patch 
"BLD",505,1,120,0)
       installation process.
"BLD",505,1,121,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,122,0)
   2.  DSM sites - You will need to disable any routines within the KMPS*
"BLD",505,1,123,0)
       namespace.  
"BLD",505,1,124,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,125,0)
   3.  Download the KIDS file KMPS1_8_2.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
"BLD",505,1,126,0)
       directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the
"BLD",505,1,127,0)
       appropriate directory on your system.
"BLD",505,1,128,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,129,0)
   4.  Use 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS 'Installation' menu,
"BLD",505,1,130,0)
       and enter: KMPS1_8_2.KID
"BLD",505,1,131,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,132,0)
       Provide the necessary directory path to the file if needed.
"BLD",505,1,133,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,134,0)
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
"BLD",505,1,135,0)
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
"BLD",505,1,136,0)
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
"BLD",505,1,137,0)
       options: 
"BLD",505,1,138,0)
          
"BLD",505,1,139,0)
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
"BLD",505,1,140,0)
          Print Transport Global 
"BLD",505,1,141,0)
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
"BLD",505,1,142,0)
          Backup a Transport Global 
"BLD",505,1,143,0)
                                   
"BLD",505,1,144,0)
   6.  As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you 
"BLD",505,1,145,0)
       do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.  
"BLD",505,1,146,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,147,0)
   7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install 
"BLD",505,1,148,0)
       Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*2.  
"BLD",505,1,149,0)
                                                 ==========
"BLD",505,1,150,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,151,0)
   8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
"BLD",505,1,152,0)
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.  
"BLD",505,1,153,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,154,0)
   9.  DSM sites - after the patch has installed, rebuild your map set if
"BLD",505,1,155,0)
       necessary.  
"BLD",505,1,156,0)
       
"BLD",505,1,157,0)
       The KMPS* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to be mapped.    
"BLD",505,1,158,0)
 
"BLD",505,1,159,0)
  10.  Review the contents of the KMP-CAPMAN mail group with the FileMan 
"BLD",505,1,160,0)
       Inquiry option to ensure that the members of the KMPS-SAGG mail 
"BLD",505,1,161,0)
       group have been properly copied.

Description: 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
============
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) to correct the
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
'Invalid reverse-path specification' transmission error within the
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software package.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
This patch release will also allow the collection routines to run on Cache
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
for OpenVMS platforms.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
All DSM, Cache for Windows NT and Cache for OpenVMS sites are instructed
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
to install this patch.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
The original 'Status of SAGG Collection Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
option has been renamed as the 'Check SAGG Environment' option.  In 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
addition to providing the previous information regarding the SAGG 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
collection routines, this option will now check the status of SAGG patch 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
installation at the site.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
The local mail message that is generated when the the SAGG background 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
routines complete their collection process has been enhanced to 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
accommodate the expanded volume set names found on the Cache for OpenVMS 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
and Cache for Windows NT platforms.  In addition, the local message will
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
recommend that the background job be run over the weekend hours if the job
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
is started during the weekday.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
The pre-install routine of this patch will move mail members from the
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
KMPS-SAGG mail group to the KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  The KMP-CAPMAN
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
mail-group was created with the release of the Resource Usage Monitor
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
(RUM) package.  All SAGG notification messages will start utilizing the
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  Any mail groups within the MAIL GROUP file that
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
have KMPS-SAGG as a MEMBER GROUP will have the KMPS-SAGG entry removed.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
This patch will remove the KMPS-SAGG mail group from the MAIL GROUP file.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
The 'Edit KMPS-SAGG Mail Group' [KMPS SAGG MAIL] option will be deleted.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
Use the 'Capacity Management Mail Group Edit' [KMP MAIL GROUP EDIT] option
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)
to change the the membership of the mail group that will receive package
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
notification messages.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
This patch will now allow SAGG to accept alphanumeric characters within 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
the site number.  This problem had effected the MPI facility located in
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
Austin.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
This patch will enable the collection of hardware information from sites
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
running DSM.  The hardware information will consist of the hardware name 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
(such as Compaq AlphaServer ES40) and the number of active cpu processors 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
installed within each node.

===================
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,104,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,105,0)
Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,106,0)
currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the day
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,107,0)
with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer than
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,108,0)
10-15 minutes.  
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,109,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,110,0)
   1.  Review the mail members of the KMPS-SAGG and KMP-CAPMAN mail groups
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,111,0)
       with the FileMan Inquiry option. A pre-install routine will attempt
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,112,0)
       to move mail members from the KMPS-SAGG mail group to the 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,113,0)
       KMP-CAPMAN mail group.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,114,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,115,0)
       Any mail members that are not automatically moved will need to be 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,116,0)
       entered manually with FileMan into the KMP-CAPMAN mail group after
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,117,0)
       completion of the patch installation process.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,118,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,119,0)
       The patch will delete the KMPS-SAGG mail group during the patch 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,120,0)
       installation process.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,121,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,122,0)
   2.  DSM sites - You will need to disable any routines within the KMPS*
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,123,0)
       namespace.  
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,124,0)
 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,125,0)
   3.  Download the KIDS file KMPS1_8_2.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,126,0)
       directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,127,0)
       appropriate directory on your system.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,128,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,129,0)
   4.  Use 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS 'Installation' menu,
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,130,0)
       and enter: KMPS1_8_2.KID
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,131,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,132,0)
       Provide the necessary directory path to the file if needed.
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,133,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,134,0)
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,135,0)
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,136,0)
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,137,0)
       options: 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,138,0)
          
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,139,0)

"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,144,0)
   6.  As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,145,0)
       do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.  
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,146,0)
       
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,147,0)
   7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install 
"PKG",347,22,1,"PAH",1,1,148,0)
       Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*2.
