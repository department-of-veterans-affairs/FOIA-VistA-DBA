Subject: UNBILLED RPT RUNS TWICE A MONTH/IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED AMOUNTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes miscellaneous items for the UNBILLED AMOUNTS REPORT. 
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1. MAD-1003-40043  Date Range: UNBILLED AMOUNTS RPT 1st Day of Month
 2. MAD-0903-42290  [IBT MONTHLY AUTO GEN UNBILLED] Option Failed
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. MAD-1003-40043  Date Range: UNBILLED AMOUNTS RPT 1st Day of Month
  
 Problem:
 --------
 With changes for End of Accounting month (EOAM), the unbilled amounts
 report now generates on the day after the EOAM, along with the ARDC.  The
 report now runs separate from the rest of the Diagnostic Measures (DM)
 reports that are scheduled to run on the first of the month. The unbilled
 amounts report ran correctly the day after EOAM, but also ran on the first
 of the month, generating the report for the next month.  This caused
 inaccurate data to be filed for the next month. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the report from generating on the first of the month with
 the other DM reports. Routine IBJDE has been modified to accommodate this
 change. The Unbilled Amounts report will now generate once, only on the
 day after the EOAM.
  
 Due to the multiple generation of the unbilled amounts report, data was
 filed for the next month that was incorrect for the IB DM EXTRACT DATA
 (#351.71), and the CLAIMS TRACKING UNBILLED AMOUNTS DATA (#356.19) files.
 A pre-init has been added to the patch that will clean up the two files
 with the incorrect data. Pre init routine IB20P248 cleans up the data in
 the two files. The pre-init routine IB20P248 will be deleted from your
 system after it runs.
  
  
 2. MAD-0903-42290  [IBT MONTHLY AUTO GEN UNBILLED] Option Failed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the unbilled amount report fails to run on the day after the end of the
 month EOAM, the sites are not able to regenerate this report.  The report
 Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED REPORT] is the
 option that the sites need to use to regenerate for the current month.
 When using this option to generate the report, the user needs to answer
 'Yes' to store the data.  If they do, and the report is run after the EOAM
 but before the first of the next month, the default date is for the
 previous month, and the site is not allowed to generate for the current
 month. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine IBTUBO has been modified to accommodate this.  If the site uses
 the Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED REPORT]
 option prior to the EOAM for the current month, the default will be for
 the previous month.  If using the option to regenerate after the
 EOAM, and before the first of the next month, the default will be
 the current month.
  
 Also,
 When running the Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED
 REPORT], it was noticed that if the data was re-generated for months prior
 to September 2003, the end date used for the generation of the report was
 the EOAM date, instead of the last day of the calendar month.  After
 September 2003, the end date that should be used is the EOAM.
  
 Routine IBTUBO has been modified to accommodate this change.
