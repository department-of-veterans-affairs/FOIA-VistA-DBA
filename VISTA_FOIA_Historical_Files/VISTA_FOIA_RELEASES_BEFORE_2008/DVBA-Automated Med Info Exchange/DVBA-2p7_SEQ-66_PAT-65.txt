 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. POR-1103-51133     Other stations unable to transer requests to Portland.
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When transferring a 2507 Exam to another hospital the transfer is not 
    accepted. The originating site uses the Transfer a C&P Request to Another
    Site [DVBA C TRANSFER C&P REQUEST] option to transfer the 2507 EXAM to
    the receiving hospital.  The process appears to work until the site
    receives the following error message in Mailman from the POSTMASTER of
    the receiving site.
     
    From: <POSTMASTER@PORTLAND.MED.VA.GOV>  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    The transfer of a C&P request to PORTLAND
    for the following veteran has failed:
    
    Name: XXXXX,XXXXX   SSN: xxxxxxxxx   C-Number: XXXXXXXX
    DOB: OCT 12,1947
   
    Reason for failure: 
   
    Addition of C&P exams for request record at target site failed.
    Therefore, the C&P request record was deleted.
   
   
    Original sender: XXXXXXX,XXXXXXat ROSEBURG.MED.VA.GOV
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The software at the receiving hospital fails to file the 2507 EXAM 
    because it assumes that the EXAM REFERENCE NUMBER and the IEN are the 
    same. It uses the last EXAM REFERENCE NUMBER and increments it by one
    and then tries to file the exam with this value as the IEN. This would
    be OK if the IEN was always equal to or less than the EXAM REFERENCE
    NUMBER. But, in the case that brought the problem to light the IEN's
    in use were of a higher value than the last EXAM REFERENCE NUMBER. This
    causes the system to see the IEN is already in use and thus it fails to
    file the exam. To correct this, we will let Fileman control and handle
    the IEN.
