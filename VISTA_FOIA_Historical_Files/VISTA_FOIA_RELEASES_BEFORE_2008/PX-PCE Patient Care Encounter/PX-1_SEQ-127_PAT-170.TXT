Description:
============

 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE: PSI-05043 - ICD reported inappropriate lookup of
 diagnosis code when entering "CHF".  
  
 Several applications are performing direct reads of the ICD DIAGNOSIS 
 (#80) file which is used in the search for diagnosis.  This file
 contains the long description for the ICD diagnosis codes as released by
 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which is the 
 Standards Development Organization (SDO) for ICD codes. In the ICD 
 DIAGNOSIS (#80) file, the long description for Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever
 contains a clause "CHF Congo Virus" and thus when the user enters "CHF",
 the only entry returned is code 065.0 for Crimean Hemorrhagic
 Fever. Most users entering "CHF" are actually seeking Congestive Heart
 Failure, code 428.0.  If these searches were performed using 
 Clinical Lexicon, the user would get a list of various congestive heart
 failure terms from which a selection can be made.  
  
 Since the majority of the NOIS/Remedy tickets citing this problem 
 reflect the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) and Patient Treatement File 
 (PTF) packages, an interim solution has been put in place to change the 
 direct reads from the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file to Clinical Lexicon within 
 these two packages.
  
 In addition, user education has been addressed to reduce these incorrect 
 diagnosis selections.  Additional review of other applications, also 
 performing direct reads of the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file, will follow and
 the long term solution will be addressed by rehosting, using the
 Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) solution.
  
 This patch (PX*1*170) will modify the PCE and Scheduling packages so that
 the diagnosis code lookup will utilize Clinical Lexicon.  Therefore, when
 a user enters "CHF" for a diagnosis code, a list of various Congestive
 Heart Failure terms will be displayed for selection.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 None
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 --------------------------------------------------------
 1.  HD00000000106458 - CHF lookup in PCE retrieves Crimean Hemorrhagic
 Fever
 2.  HD00000000106455 - CHF lookup in Appt Mgr finds Crimean Hemorrhagic 
 Fever
  
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------
  
 Problem:  When a user enters "CHF" for a diagnosis code within the PCE
 checkout process it retrieves Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever instead of
 Congestive Heart Failure 
  
 Resolution:  Modified the application PCE & Appt Mgr to lookup 
 diagnosis codes using CLINICAL LEXICON.
