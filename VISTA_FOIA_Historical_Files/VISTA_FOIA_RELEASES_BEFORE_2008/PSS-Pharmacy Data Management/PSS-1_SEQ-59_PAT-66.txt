Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 1. This patch, in conjunction with CPRS patches OR*3.0*149 and OR*3.0*158,
    fixes a problem that can occur when entering an order for an outpatient
    in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) using the IV Fluids order
    dialogue. The DEA Special Handling check does not always function when
    entering those orders. So it is possible for a Provider without a DEA#
    or a VA# to enter an order through this dialogue for an Orderable Item,
    when that order should not be allowed to be placed. When this patch and
    both CPRS patches OR*3.0*149 and OR*3.0*158 are installed, this
    functionality will work properly. Patch OR*3.0*149 will fix this
    problem for orders entered through CPRS GUI, and patch OR*3.0*158 will
    fix this problem for orders entered through CPRS ListMan. No problems
    will occur if the PSS*1.0*66 patch is installed without either one or
    both of the CPRS patches, but the functionality will not work properly
    until all patches are installed. NOIS JAC-0602-72390
  
 2. A site reported a problem with entering the cost information for drugs
    with cost like NNNNN.NNN per order unit. Currently, the PRICE PER ORDER
    UNIT field (#13) in the DRUG file (#50) only allows 4 digits before the
    decimal point. This patch modifies the Data Dictionary of this field to
    accommodate 5 digits. NOIS POR-0902-50198
  
 3. A minor change has been made to the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
    Application Program Interface (API) to allow other pharmacy packages to
    make use of it, whenever they update the DRUG file (#50) so that PDM
    possibly generates an HL7 outgoing drug message.
  
 4. A site reported a problem with the display of the cost information 
    for drugs with local possible dosages. This patch corrects this
    problem. NOIS REN-0902-60126

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation takes
 less than two minutes. This patch can be installed at any time.
   
  1. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select

  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options

        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
