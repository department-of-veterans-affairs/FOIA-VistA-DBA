Subject: ALLOW PCE TO CREATE VISITS FOR A DISPOSITION LOCATION.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  When CPRS files a progress note for a visit, Patient Care Encounter 
  (PCE) will reject the filing of the visit with a disposition location.  
  Therefore, the progress note will not be seen on the CPRS cover sheet 
  visit list.  Subsequently, a visit created when the registration is 
  dispositioned appears on the cover sheet but the previously entered 
  progress note is not displayed.  
  
  This patch modifies PCE to accept the disposition locations.  Therefore, 
  CPRS can file a progress note and it will be displayed in the patient's 
  visit history.  This patch also deletes the PCE Edit Disposition Clinics, 
  [PX PCE EDIT DISPOSITION CLINIC], option.  
  
  After this patch and DG*5.3*459 (Removal of Workload Capture) are
  installed, the workload associated with disposition will no longer be
  captured in the Registration process but will need to be done through
  Scheduling or PCE options.  Existing disposition hospital locations will
  continue to be marked as disposition locations, but there will be no
  need to identify new locations in the future.
  
  After patch PX*1*116 is loaded, patch TIU*1*141 should also be loaded.
  The TIU patch permits disposition locations to be selected when entering
  a new visit or selecting an existing visit in TIU List Manager (LM).

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption 
  to users. CPRS GUI activity should be minimal. Installation should not
  take more than 1 minutes.
  
                                   **Warning** 
  When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
  is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question. If you choose to have KIDs rebuild 
  the menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may
  take several hours.
  
  Note: Most sites have a nightly batch job that rebuilds the menus so if
  you queued the installations ensure that it will complete prior to the 
  batch job.  Or, if you are installing several builds, wait until the last
  one to use the KIDs rebuild functionality.
  
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only].
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PX*1.0*116:)
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*116.
  
  6.  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?',
      respond NO.
  
  8.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
      When prompted to select the OPTIONS you would like to place out of 
      order, enter the following:
  
      PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY       PCE Encounter Data Entry
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE   PCE Encounter Data Entry and Delete
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE  PCE Encounter Data Entry without Delete
      PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER      PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor
      PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER           PCE Encounter Viewer
  
  9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
