Subject: INACTIVATE PATIENT COMPARING IEN TO STATION NUMBER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
   avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
   of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
   
   Issue 1:  During the background process of inactivating a patient from 
   the Master Patient Index (MPI), it is possible for an exception message
   to be generated stating that the CMOR is not located at this site. This 
   exception stops the inactivation of the patient from the MPI. This is 
   an incorrect exception if your site actually is the CMOR. The 
   comparison being done is the internal entry number (IEN) of the 
   patient's CMOR entry in your site's INSTITUTION file (#4) with the
   station number of your site's facility. If they did NOT match, this
   exception was generated. 
  
   The comparison is now station number to station number, rather than the
   IEN of the patient's CMOR entry in the INSTITUTION file (#4) to the
   station number. This correction has been made in the routine MPIFDEL.
  
   Issue 2:  It was noted that exceptions generated during the inactivation
   process do not store the Patient DFN in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG file 
   (#991.1).  This has also been corrected in routine MPIFDEL
  
   Issue 3:  It was noted during the SQA review of this patch that CIRN 
   Master of Record was being displayed instead of Coordinating Master of
   Record.  The display has been updated.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.   
  
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  This routine is not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*19.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes:
  
         [MPIF PAT INACT]          Inactivate Patient from MPI
      
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation 
        has completed.
