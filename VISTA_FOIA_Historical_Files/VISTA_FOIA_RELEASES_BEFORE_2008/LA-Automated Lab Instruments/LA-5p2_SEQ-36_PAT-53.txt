Subject: CONVERT CAREVUE PACKAGE FROM CLASS III TO CLASS I SOFTWARE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch to the Laboratory package does not contain any changes to the
 VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA
 BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE.
  
 This patch should be installed prior to installing patch LR*5.2*254.
  
 *NOTE*  All sites SHOULD install this patch even if site does not have
         or does not plan to use CareVue instrumentation.
  
  
 This patch will install the CareVue interface package under the Namespace
 LA7D as a Class I national patch.
  
 1. Problem: Current CareVue interface is Class III software.
  
    Solution: The code has been validated, brought up to national
              standard and released as a Class I national patch.
  
  
 An interface engine must exist to connect CareVue (or other clinical
 system) and Vista using TCP/IP and HL7 messages.  Three possible contacts
 for this interface engine are STC, Inc., MSI Solutions Inc. and Agilent
 Technologies.
  
 STC, Inc. can be contacted at:
       Richard Garcia
       voice: 626.471.6000 x6755
       fax:   626.471.6104
       email: rmg@stc.com
  
 MSI Solutions, Inc. can be contacted at:
       Bob Kelliher

 About this software:
 ====================
 1.   An option to enter/delete supported wards for the FOREIGN
      INTERFACE file(#62.487) is exported with this version of the patch.
  
     **NOTE** 
        All wards in the hospital location file (#44) that will be
        used for the CareVue interface must have a UNIQUE abbreviation for
        each ward (Inactive and Active)
  
 2.  Resulting from this installation, the entries DHCP CARELIFE and 
     MRTS CARELIFE will automatically be added to the HL7 APPLICATION 
     PARAMETER file(#771). These entries will be used to send HL7 messages
     to the CareVue system.  These parameters also need to be edited to 
     enter your facility name.
    
 3.  The following file is included in this release.  It is in the LA7D
     namespace, also listed in the main installation procedure:
  
             File #62.487 File name FOREIGN INTERFACE
  
 4.  The following mail group will be automatically added to the MAIL
     GROUP file(#3.8) during this installation:  CARELIFE RESULT ERROR
  
 5.  This installation automatically adds the two new protocols to the
     PROTOCOL file(#101).  They are:  LA7D CARELIFE RESULTS
                                      LA7D CARELIFE SERVER
  
 6   The routines exported with this release, listed in the Routines 
     section of this document, are customized to send verified 
     Laboratory data to CareVue for all patients located on a CareVue 
     ward.

 The CareVue interface utilizes VISTA'S Laboratory Test Result system to
 send Observation Request Unsolicited (ORU) messages to the CareVue system.
  The interface messages are based on ward location and passed to an
 interface engine.  When Lab results are verified and the requesting ward
 is identified as having a supported entry in the new CareVue FOREIGN
 INTERFACE file #62.487, the lab results are forwarded, via HL7, to the
 interface engine and then on to the CareVue Clinical Information
 Management System.
  
 Each facility will need to refer to the CareVue Interface Specifications
 Manual, LA7DIS.PDF, as noted above for further requirements regarding
 interface engines.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 ==========================
 The patch is distributed in KIDS format in a PackMan message.
  
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 1.   All routines installed with this patch are new to the system and 
      mapping is not recommended.
  
 2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.      
      This option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your   
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport 
      global.
  
         On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
         following options:
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
  
 4.   Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' men
      and select the package 'LA*5.2*53'.  When prompted 'Want to 
      DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',  
      choose 'NO'.
  
 5.   At the DEVICE prompt, you can send your output to any printer of
      HFS file, display it on the terminal screen, or queue it to run 
      at a scheduled time.
  
 6.   No options need to be placed out of service.
  
 7.   This installation automatically adds the two new protocols to 
      the PROTOCOL file(#101). They are:  LA7D CARELIFE RESULTS
                                          LA7D CARELIFE SERVER
