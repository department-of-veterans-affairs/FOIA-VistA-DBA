Subject: RACE/ETHNICITY MODIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch will revise the call to the VADM array for retrieving patient's
 race and ethnicity information.  The new race/ethnicity format is
 nationally mandated, hence the need for Spinal Cord Dysfunction (SCD) to
 reference the new format.
  
 Two other enhancements are included in this patch:
  
         1. Implementation of the SPN REG STATUS UPDATE protocol, which
 automatically and immediately updates the Registration Status field (#.03)
 of the SCD (SPINAL CORD) REGISTRY file (#154) upon entry of a value in the
 DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) of the PATIENT file (#2).
  
         2. Implementation of the SPN REG STATUS DELETE protocol, which
 automatically and immediately sends a Mailman message to the SPNL SCD 
 COORDINATOR mail group when a patient's Date of Death value is deleted
 from his PATIENT file (#2) record.  The message notifies its recipients to
 verify the death rescindment, and enter a correct value in the
 Registration Status field (#.03) in the SCD (SPINAL CORD) REGISTRY file
 (#154).

   General Information.
   ====================
  
  This patch should be installed into your production UCI.  It can be
  installed at anytime.  You may experience pauses during installation, but
  install time should not take more than ten minutes. No options need to be
  disabled.  An environment check will be performed to ensure that the
  installing site has installed DG*5.3*415 and SPN*2*19.
  
  
   Installation Instructions.
   ==========================
  
   Users of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction package may remain online during
   installation.
  
   This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:
  
     1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build
          onto your system.
     2) Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
          Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
          the mapped set at this time.
     3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option
          'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all
          routines have the correct checksums.
     4) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option 'Install
          Package(s)'.  Select the package 'SPN*2.0*18' and proceed with
          install.
     5) It is recommended that you answer 'NO' to each of the following
          questions:
            a) 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
            b) 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
                Protocols?'
     6) If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
          returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
          completion.
