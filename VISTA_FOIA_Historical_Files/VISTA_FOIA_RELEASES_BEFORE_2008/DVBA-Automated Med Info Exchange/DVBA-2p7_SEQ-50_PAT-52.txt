 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1) VAC-0303-20793  ADD C&P AMIE WORKSHEET
  
    Problem:
    -------
    1) Dr. Tomlinson (C&P Regulation Office, VACO) requested that a new
       attachment be added to the COLD INJURY PROTOCOL EXAMINATION
       worksheet (#1730).  It would be named ATTACHMENT B:  PROTOCOL
       EXAMINATION HISTORY FOR COLD INJURIES. 
        
    Resolution: 
    ----------
    1) Routine DVBCWCI2 was created to contain the text of the new
       ATTACHMENT B examination sheet.
    2) Created routine DVBCWCI3 to print the text contained in DVBCWCI2.
    3) Created routine DVBCWCI4 from DVBCWCI. DVBCWCI4 will print
       the current worksheet #1730 and then call DVBCWCI3 to print the
       new attachment B worksheet.
    4) Created post-init routine DVBA52PI to deactivate DVBCWCI and
       activate DVBCWCI4 as the REPORTING PROGRAM NAME (field #7) for
       the COLD INJURY PROTOCOL EXAMINATION (#147) entry in the AMIE EXAM
       (#396.6) file. 
  
    ************NOTE***************
    To view the format of the new ATTACHMENT B, use the following options
    to print a blank C&P worksheet.
       
       Options:
          1) DVBA C MEDICAL ADMIN C&P MENU
          2) Print Blank C&P Worksheet
          3) Choose:  COLD INJURY PROTOCOL EXAMINATION (#1730)
