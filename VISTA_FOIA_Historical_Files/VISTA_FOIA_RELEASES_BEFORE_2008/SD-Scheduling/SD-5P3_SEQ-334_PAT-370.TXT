Subject: ARCP AD HOC REPORT TO NOT PULL TEST PATIENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem with the ACRP Ad Hoc Report 
 [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT]. The report prints test patients, and is 
 therefore reporting data incorrectly.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. POR-0402-52292 ACRP Ad Hoc Report pulls test patients into report
   
    Problem:
    ------------        
    The ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] option prints 
    test patients on the report which creates an inaccurate report.
   
    Resolution:
    ---------------
    The routine was corrected to not process the PATIENT (#2) file 
    record if the cross reference calculated field: TEST PATIENT 
    INDICATOR field (#.6) is set; this is a field that is automatically 
    set if the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09) has five 
    leading zeros.
   
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 The TEST PATIENT INDICATOR field (#.6) cross reference in the
 PATIENT file (#2), ^DPT("ATEST" ,DFN) is now tested for existence.
 The following code was added to the routine:
   
 ;CHECK FOR TEST PATIENT
 I $D(^DPT("ATEST",$P(SDOE0,U,2))) Q
  
  
 Note: There is a known cross reference problem for the above field that
 might cause some test patients to continue to appear on reports after the 
 installation of this patch. (Only 1 out of 6 of our test sites found 
 this to be the case). This will be cleared up with the installation
 of upcoming patch DG*5.3*641.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 2 minutes.
   
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
    [Note: TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will 
    display the patch text only].
   
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
    from the mapped set at this time.
    
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
   
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*370)
   
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
   
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     SD*5.3*370.
   
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//', respond NO
   
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES
    
    When prompted to select the options you would like to place out 
    of order, enter the following:
    
          ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT]
    
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the 
    installation has run to completion.
