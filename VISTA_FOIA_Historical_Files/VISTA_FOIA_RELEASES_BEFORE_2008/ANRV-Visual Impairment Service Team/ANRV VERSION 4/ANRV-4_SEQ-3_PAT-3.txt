Subject: FIX TO VARO REPORT FOR CORRECT DATA DISPLAY.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 NOIS # HUN-0700-21173
 Problem reported at Huntington, WV
  
 Test Sites
 ==========
  
 Huntington, WV
 Seattle, WA
  
  
 An incomplete data set was being displayed in the VARO Report (invoked by
 the VIST option 'VARO Claims List'. An error was found in the routine
 ^ANRVRP9 that caused this problem.  This patch contains a fix to this
 routine.
 The routine was Creating an array of VARO claims using the .01 field as
 the reference to file #2043.5.  The Array was then used to reference back
 to file #2043.5 using the .01 as the IEN.  As this file is no longer
 DINUM'ed this processing no longer works.
 It appears that this problem has arisen with VARO entries made after
 version 4.0 of VIST was installed.
 Users discovered the error when running the VARO report.  A number of
 entries on the report contained no VARO data - even though when the
 Enter/edit VARO data option was used to check the entry data was found.
 After the installation of this patch all data is displayed correctly.
