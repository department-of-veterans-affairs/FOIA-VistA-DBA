Description:
============

  HUN-1003-22262 - Med Order Button
  ---------------------------------
  If a nurse enters an order via the Med Order Button on the BCMA 
  (Bar Code Medication Administration) application, and this is the only 
  order for that patient, the order will not show up on the 
  Non-Verified/Pending Order (PSJU VBW) option if selected by Group,
  Ward or Clinic.  This patch will resolve this issue.
 
 
  ERI-0205-20902 - Allergy Checking
  ---------------------------------
  While testing CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System) V25,
  it was discovered that not all Allergy checks were being displayed.  
  This could occur if there were multiple VA DRUG CLASS entries 
  entered for a patient.  A change will be made to loop all VA DRUG 
  CLASS entries for the patient to correctly identify potential drug
  allergies.
 
 
  PUG-0205-50079 - Report printer length
  --------------------------------------
  There is an inconsistency between the length of the IV ROOM (#59.5) file
  fields LABEL DEVICE (#13) and REPORT DEVICE (#14) and the 
  corresponding entry in the DEVICE (#3.5) file.  The IV ROOM fields only
  allows 20 characters and the DEVICE file allows 30 characters.  The IV 
  ROOM file fields LABEL DEVICE and REPORT DEVICE will be changed 
  to allow 30 characters.
