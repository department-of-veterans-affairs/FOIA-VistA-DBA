Subject: DSS EXTRACT FIXES & FILE #729 UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 I.   NOIS ISSUES
      ===========
  
   1) This patch will correct the way DSS encounter numbers are created in
      the MOV (Transfer and Discharge) and LAB (Laboratory) extracts
      for patients who have multiple admission periods covering the
      same day. Currently, both of these extracts are passing only the date
      value to obtain inpatient/outpatient status data which is used in
      determining the encounter number.  Since only the date is passed, the
      earliest movement data for that date is incorrectly picked up and
      used.  This has been changed to use the date/time value to obtain the
      correct movement data.
  
      This was reported by Palo Alto and also was reported in
      NOIS LON-0302-60308.
  
  
 II.  EXTRACT MODIFICATIONS
      =====================
  
   1) Modifications were made to SUR (Surgery) extract time fields 
      to count any time value between zero and 7.5 minutes as one 15 minute
      increment.  Previously, these values were reported as a zero time 
      increment. The SUR extract fields affected are: PATIENT TIME (#19),
      OPERATION TIME (#20), ANESTHESIA TIME (#21), and
      RECOVERY ROOM TIME (#32).
  
   2) Eligibility Code PURPLE HEART RECIPIENT was added to the DSS 
      eligibility code table.
  
      Eligibility Code          Description              NPCD Code

            22               Purple Heart Recipient          25
  
  
 III. FILE UPDATE
      ===========
  
   1) Four new entries will be added to the DSS PRODUCTION UNIT file
      (#729).
      The four entries are:

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
   DSS Extract users to prevent the use of options until installation has
   been completed.
     
   If you are running the install interactively and not rebuilding user 
   menus, installation will take less than 2 minutes. 
     
   Note:  If you are not running the installation interactively and intend
          to allow KIDS to start the rebuild of user menus upon completion
          of the install, then please queue the install for a period of
          low system activity.
     
   No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
   more than once.
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
      
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu. (Skip this step if already in the 
       Installation menu)
      
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*42):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
      
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*42.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
       ECX MAINTENANCE       Maintenance
       ECXMENU               Package Extracts
  
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
