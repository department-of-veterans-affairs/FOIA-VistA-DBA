  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
         1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
            option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your 
            system.
         2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should
            be removed from the mapped set at this time.
         3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
            system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport 
            global.
            On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
            following options:
                Print Transport Global
                Compare Transport Global to Current System
                Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                Backup a Transport Global
         4. No options need to be placed out of service.
         5. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off peak hours
            and less than 5 minutes during peak hours.
         6. Installation of this patch requires no additional memory space.
         7. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option 
            'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'LA*5.2*40' and proceed
            with the install.
         8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
            returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
            completion.
        9. Delete routine LA40.
