 PATCH OVERVIEW
  
 The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
 Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
 ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic transmission 
 of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers and the receipt 
 of claim responses (including drug utilization review responses and 
 warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and introduced in a 
 phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy was utilized due 
 to the complexity of the functionality and the number of product line 
 dependencies.
  
 The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1.0, comprised of 
 the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
 namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
 PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation. The patches
 are combined in host file BPS_1_0.KID in order to simplify installation.
 BPS*1.0 is a dormant release that only allows each site to perform preliminary
 setup work and to confirm that the software does not adversely affect other 
 packages.  The software for PSS*1*81 is installed automatically when the host
 file, BPS_1_0.KID, is installed.
  
 There are two main areas addressed by BPS*1.0:
  
 a. Registration of the Pharmacy with the Vitria BusinessWare IE.
 b. The Insurance Matching of Group Plans with Pharmacy Plans.
 
 Following the installation of BPS*1.0, each site must register their 
 pharmacy with Vitria and match applicable insurance group plans using the 
 insurance matching screens. These processes are detailed in the HIPAA NCPDP 
 CONNECTION FOR EDI PHARMACY INSTALLATION GUIDE and the E-PHARMACY CLAIMS 
 INSURANCE PROCESS document. Both of these documents are located on the 
 anonymous directory. It is very important that the IRM or person installing 
 the patch at each facility provide a copy of these documents to its 
 ADPAC(s) and any other relevant staff who will be responsible for 
 registering their pharmacy with Vitria and completing the insurance 
 matching process.
  
 At a later date, additional HIPAA NCPDP patches will be released to 
 activate all of the HIPAA NCPDP functionality. Until that time, sites will 
 not be able to electronically submit claims utilizing this new 
 functionality.
  
 The HIPAA NCPDP project was created in response to a Chief Business Office 
 (CBO) request for modifications to several Veterans Health Information 
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) software applications in 
 accordance with HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions and 
 NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically the NCPDP Telecommunication 
 Standard v.5.1.
  
 The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.
  
 Overview of the Process:
  
 The changes to Pharmacy Data Management are as follows:
  
 1. DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG (#50) file.
  
 Routine PSSDDUT2 was modified to accommodate the use of the letter 'E' 
 within the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50).
  
  
 Data Dictionary Changes in Outpatient Pharmacy:
  
 1. For the DRUG file (#50), the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field for the 
 drug will need to accommodate the use of the letter 'E' to indicate that a 
 drug is billable for ECME purposes.  The routine dealing with the Help Text 
 of this field was modified to accommodate the inclusion of an 'E' within 
 the list of possible entries.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 
 The ECME documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 Installation Steps
  
  1. Use VA FileMan to add the new domain, EPHARMACY.VITRIA-EDI.AAC.VA.GOV, 
     to the DOMAIN file (#4.2). The installation instructions are included in 
     the patch description for the XM*DBA*160 patch. This domain must be in 
     place before the installation of the IB*2*251 patch that is included in the 
     BPS 1.0 Master Build.
  
  2. Download the KIDS file BPS_1_0.KID via FTP. This file needs to be 
     retrieved in ASCII format.
  
  3. Review mapped sets for the PSS*, IB*, and PRCA*namespaces.  If the 
     routines are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this 
     time.
   
  4. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the 
     Installation menu.
  
  5. From this menu, select the Load a Distribution option. When prompted 
     for a file name, enter the directory name where you FTPd the build, followed
     by BPS_1_0. In our example, the file name is USER$:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_0.KID.
     Determine the location where you stored your build to decide the correct 
     file name entry.
  
  6. At the "Want to Continue with Load? YES//" prompt, enter YES.
  
  7. At the "Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine: YES//" prompt, answer 
     YES.
  
  8. From this menu, the installer may select to use the following options:
  
 (When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter BPS 1.0)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message 
     of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other 
     changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow 
     you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It 
     compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure the 
     integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  9. At the "Select Installation Option:" prompt, enter 6 Install Package(s)
  
 10. At the "Select INSTALL NAME:" prompt, enter BPS 1.0.
  
 11. When prompted, "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
 12. When prompted, "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
     respond NO.
  
 13. When prompted, "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 14. When prompted, "Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 15. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be returned to 
     the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
