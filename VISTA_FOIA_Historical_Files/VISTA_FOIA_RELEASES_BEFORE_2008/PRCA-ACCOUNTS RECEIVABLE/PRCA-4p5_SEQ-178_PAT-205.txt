Subject: OIG HEADER RECORD (MODIFICATION)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch has been requested by the "Office of the Inspector General".
  
 While reviewing the process by which bill-level information is transmitted
 to the OIG Database from Accounts Receivable (AR), some data discrepancies
 were discovered.  It appears that the OIG Database is not capturing all of
 the bills that are transmitted by a site.
  
 The likely cause of this problem is that messages from AR sporadically do
 not reach the database.  These messages may not successfully transfer to
 the database from the Austin DMI Queue, or they may get lost when Austin
 systems suffer downtime.  Since the bill-level data is sent to Austin in a
 series of messages, the OIG system cannot determine if it has successfully
 received and processed all of the messages that were transmitted by a
 specific facility. Resolution of this problem relies on the creation of a
 header record for the AR electronic message.
  
 The header record will include the following:
  
 1. The total number of extract messages that will be transmitted to Austin.
 2. The sequential message number of the message itself
    (i.e., "message 5 of 21").
  
 Austin will develop a report on the OIG system that will list all sites for
 which the indicated number of total messages was not received.  Austin staff
 will manually review the list and contact those sites included on the list to
 ask the site to re-generate the extract.

            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
