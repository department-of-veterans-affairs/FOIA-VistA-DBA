Description:
============

 THIS PATCH MUST BE INSTALLED BY OCTOBER 24, 2003.
  
 IRM SHOULD PROVIDE THE FEE STAFF WITH A COPY OF THIS PATCH DESCRIPTION.
  
 This patch contains enhancements to VistA Fee Basis for the Fee
 Replacement Phase 1 project.  This patch also corrects three minor bugs.
  
 The enhancements include updates to the invoice prompts and specified
 outputs to support EDI claims for HIPAA compliance.  This patch adds a new
 interface that will send data concerning EDI claims to the Fee Payment
 Processing System (FPPS) hosted at the Health Administration Center (HAC)
 so FPPS can generate electronic remittance advice to the vendor.  This
 patch adds new options that allow for the update of specified data
 elements on EDI claims that have been paid in VistA Fee and contain EDI
 specific data elements that were incorrectly data entered at time of
 invoice entry.
  
 The fixes include corrections for a problem that can occur when an
 existing (duplicate) payment is edited using Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER
 PAYMENT] option and a separate problem with the Payment Look-Up for
 Medical Vendor [FBAA VENDOR LOOKUP] option.   A problem with entry of four
 ICD diagnosis or procedure codes on a civil hospital invoice is also
 corrected.
  
 The Fee Basis User Manual is being updated to reflect the changes 
 introduced by this patch. The updated manual will be available shortly
 (a day or two) after the patch release date. It can be downloaded from the
 VistA Document Library web page.
    http://www.va.gov/vdl
 In the interim, a supplemental PDF document containing the User Manual 
 updates is being released with the patch.  This document provides users
 with a quick reference guide to the changes introduced with patch
 FB*3.5*61. These changes will also be incorporated into the online version
 of the VistA Fee Basis User Manual. See the installation section of this
 patch for more information.

 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
  1. MAINTAIN CODE SETS TO SUPPORT NEW INVOICE DATA FIELDS 
  
     This patch adds the data for several code sets to VistA Fee Basis so
     the application can ensure that only active HIPAA compliant codes are 
     selected by a fee clerk when the results of the adjudication are
     entered for a health care claim.  The code sets are
  
       Code Set                        Stored in New File
       -----------------------------   ------------------
       Claim Adjustment Reason Codes   ADJUSTMENT REASON (#161.91)
       Claim Adjustment Group Codes    ADJUSTMENT GROUP (#161.92)
       Remittance Remarks Codes        REMITTANCE REMARK (#161.93)
  
  
  2. COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA FOR UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS
  
     This patch updates the unauthorized claims module to obtain the FPPS
     CLAIM ID for unauthorized EDI claims.
  
     The user will be prompted "Is this an EDI claim from the FPPS system?"
     when an unauthorized claim is entered or edited.  If the answer is Yes
     then a FPPS CLAIM ID must be entered and stored.  If the user answers
     No during an edit of an existing claim then any existing value in the
     FPPS CLAIM ID field will be deleted.
  
     The following options are modified:
       Enter Unauthorized Claim    [FBUC ENTER]
       Modify Unauthorized Claim   [FBUC MODIFY UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM]
       Re-open Unauthorized Claim  [FBUC REOPEN]
  
  
  3. COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA FOR OUTPATIENT AND ANCILLARY INVOICES
  
     This patch updates the Fee Basis software to obtain additional data
     when an outpatient or ancillary payment is entered or edited.  The
     changes are described below.
  
     a. Identify payments that are for an EDI claim
  
        The user will be prompted to identify when the payment is for an
        EDI claim from the Fee Payment Processing System (FPPS).
  
        The user will be prompted "Is this an EDI claim from the FPPS
        system?" However, this prompt will not be asked when the payment is
        for an approved unauthorized claim.  For unauthorized claim
        payments, the identification of an EDI claim will be automatically
        derived based on the content of the FPPS CLAIM ID field for the
        unauthorized claim.
  
        If the user changes the answer from YES to NO for an existing
        payment then any existing value in the FPPS CLAIM ID field and the
        FPPS LINE ITEM field must be deleted.
  
     b. Collect information specific to payments for an EDI claim
  
        If the payment has been identified as for an EDI claim then the
        user will normally be prompted for two additional items (FPPS CLAIM
        ID and FPPS LINE ITEM). However, the FPPS CLAIM ID will be obtained
        from the unauthorized claim instead of a prompt when the payment is
        for an approved unauthorized claim.
  
     c. Collect additional payment information for both EDI and non-EDI
        claims.
  
        When appropriate, the user may be prompted for the following new
        data elements when entering or editing payments for both EDI and
        non-EDI claims.
          PATIENT ACCOUNT NUMBER
          REVENUE CODE
          UNITS PAID
          ADJUSTMENT REASON
          ADJUSTMENT GROUP
          ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
          REMITTANCE REMARK
  
        For both EDI and non-EDI claim payments, the user will no longer be
        asked for the AMOUNT SUSPENDED, SUSPEND CODE, and DESCRIPTION OF
        SUSPENSION.  Instead these fields will be automatically populated
        based on the contents of the ADJUSTMENT REASON and ADJUSTMENT
        AMOUNT fields.
  
     The following options are modified:
       C&P/Multiple Patient Payment Entry  [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
       Enter Payment                       [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
       Multiple Payment Entry              [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
       Reimbursement Payment Entry         [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
       Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
       Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Multiple Ancillary Payments         [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
       Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
         Services
       Edit Ancillary Payment              [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Payments for Unauthorized Claims    [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
  
  4. COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA FOR PHARMACY INVOICES
  
     The patch updates the Fee Basis software to obtain additional data
     when an pharmacy invoice is entered or edited.  The changes are
     described below.
  
     a. Identify invoices that are for an EDI claim
  
        The user will be prompted to identify when the invoice is for an
        EDI claim from the Fee Payment Processing System (FPPS).
  
        The user will be prompted "Is this an EDI claim from the FPPS
        system?". However, this prompt will not be asked when the payment
        is for an approved unauthorized claim.  For unauthorized claim
        payments, the identification of an EDI claim will be automatically
        derived based on the content of the FPPS CLAIM ID field for the
        unauthorized claim.
  
        If the user changes the answer from YES to NO for an existing
        payment then any existing value in the FPPS CLAIM ID field and the
        FPPS LINE ITEM field will be deleted.
  
    b.  Collect information specific to payments for an EDI claim
  
        If the payment has been identified as for an EDI claim then the
        user will normally be prompted for two additional items (FPPS CLAIM
        ID and FPPS LINE ITEM). However, the FPPS CLAIM ID will be obtained
        from the unauthorized claim instead of a prompt when the payment is
        for an approved unauthorized claim.
  
    c. Collect additional payment information for both EDI and non-EDI
       claims.
  
       When appropriate, the user may be prompted for the following new
       data elements when entering or editing invoices for both EDI and
       non-EDI claims.
         ADJUSTMENT REASON
         ADJUSTMENT GROUP
         ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
         REMITTANCE REMARK
       For both EDI and non-EDI claim payments, the user will no longer be
       asked for the AMOUNT SUSPENDED, SUSPEND CODE, and DESCRIPTION OF
       SUSPENSION.  Instead these fields will be automatically populated
       based on the contents of the ADJUSTMENT REASON and ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
       fields.
  
     The following options are modified:
       Enter Pharmacy Invoice            [FBAA ENTER PHARMACY INVOICE]
       Patient Re-imbursement            [FBAA REIMBURSEMENT PHARMACY]
       Review Fee Prescription           [FBAA PHARMACY REVIEW]
       Complete Pharmacy Invoice         [FBAA COMPLETE PHARMACY INVOICE]
       List Invoices Pending MAS         [FBAA PENDING MAS COMPLETION]
         Completion
       Edit Pharmacy Invoice             [FBAA EDIT PHARMACY INVOICE]
       Payments for Unauthorized Claims  [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
  
  5. COLLECT ADDITIONAL DATA FOR CIVIL HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY NURSING HOME
     INVOICES
  
     This patch updates the Fee Basis software to obtain additional data
     when a civil hospital or community nursing home invoice is entered or
     edited.  The changes are described below.
  
     a. Identify invoice that is for an EDI claim
  
        The user will be prompted to identify when the invoice is for an
        EDI claim from the Fee Payment Processing System (FPPS). The user
        will be prompted "Is this an EDI claim from the FPPS system?".   
        However, this prompt will not be asked when the payment is for an 
        approved unauthorized claim.  For unauthorized claim payments, the 
        identification of an EDI claim will be automatically derived based
        on the content of the FPPS CLAIM ID field for the unauthorized
        claim.
  
        If the user changes the answer from YES to NO for an existing
        payment then any existing value in the FPPS CLAIM ID field and the
        FPPS LINE ITEM field will be deleted.
  
     b. Collect information specific to payments for an EDI claim
  
        If the invoice has been identified as for an EDI claim then the
        user will normally be prompted for two additional items (FPPS CLAIM
        ID and FPPS LINE ITEM). However, the FPPS CLAIM ID will be obtained
        from the unauthorized claim instead of a prompt when the payment is
        for an approved unauthorized claim.
  
     c. Collect additional payment information for both EDI and non-EDI
        claims.
  
        When appropriate, the user may be prompted for the following new
        data elements when entering or editing payments for both EDI and
        non-EDI claims.
          PATIENT CONTROL NUMBER
          COVERED DAYS
          DRG WEIGHT
          ADJUSTMENT REASON
          ADJUSTMENT GROUP
          ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
          REMITTANCE REMARK
  
        For both EDI and non-EDI claim payments, the user will no longer be
        asked for the AMOUNT SUSPENDED, SUSPEND CODE, and DESCRIPTION OF
        SUSPENSION.  Instead these fields will be automatically populated
        based on the contents of the ADJUSTMENT REASON and ADJUSTMENT
        AMOUNT fields.
  
     The following options are modified:
       Enter Invoice/Payment              [FBCH ENTER PAYMENT]
       Reimbursement for Inpatient        [FBCH REIMBURSEMENT INVOICE]
         Hospital Invoice
       Invoice Edit                       [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT]
       Re-initiate Pricer Rejected Items  [FBCH REINITIATE PRICER REJECTS]
       Complete A Payment                 [FBCH COMPLETE PAYMENT]
       Enter CNH Payment                  [FBCNH ENTER PAYMENT]
       Edit CNH Payment                   [FBCNH EDIT PAYMENT]
       Payments for Unauthorized Claims   [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
  
  6. Ensure Line Items on an Invoice are Paid at the Same Time 
  
     Outpatient, ancillary, and pharmacy invoices may have multiple line
     items on a single invoice.  To ensure that all the line items on an
     invoice are paid at the same time, this patch modifies VistA Fee to
     require that all line items for a single invoice are located in the
     same payment batch.
  
     a. Options that allow new line items to be added to an existing
        invoice are modified to ensure that the new line items are placed
        in the same payment batch as the existing invoice.
        The following options are modified:
          C&P/Multiple Patient Payment     [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
            Entry
          Enter Payment                    [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
          Multiple Payment Entry           [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
          Reimbursement Payment Entry      [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
          Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH      [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
            Payment
          Multiple Ancillary Payments      [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
          Patient Reimbursement for        [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
            Ancillary Services
          Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
     b. Options that allow existing outpatient/ancillary line items to be
        moved to a different payment batch have been modified to assign a
        new invoice number to the moved line items if some of that
        invoice's line items are staying in the original batch.  This
        splits the original invoice into two invoices so all the line items
        for a given invoice will be in the same payment batch.
        The following options are modified:
          Re-initiate Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REINITIATE REJECTS]
  
  
  7. SUPPORT 0.00 PAYMENT FOR CH/CNH INVOICES
  
     The AMOUNT PAID (#8) field in the FEE BASIS INVOICE (#162.5) file
     is modified to allow entry of 0.00 for civil hospital and community
     nursing home invoices.
     The medical fee and pharmacy invoices already allow entry of a 0.00
     payment.
  
  
  8. USE UNITS IN FEE SCHEDULE CALCULATION 
  
     This patch updates the fee schedule calculation for outpatient and
     ancillary services to consider units.
  
     When a fee schedule amount is calculated, the system shall multiply
     the fee schedule amount by the number of units and use the result as
     the default amount paid.  This should always occur for the RBRVS fee
     schedule.  However, units are not multiplied with the VA Fee Schedule
     amount until dates of service in fiscal year 2005 or later to ensure
     the fee schedule amount is a per unit value.
  
  
  9. REPORT BY FPPS CLAIM ID
  
     This patch creates a new report to list VistA Invoice Numbers
     associated with a user-specified FPPS Claim ID.  The new option
     is FPPS Claim Inquiry [FB FPPS CLAIM INQ].  It is attached to the
     following menus:
       Outputs Main Menu                [FBAA OUTPUTS MENU]
       Pharmacy Fee Main Menu           [FBAA PHARMACY MAIN MENU]
       Output Menu                      [FBCH OUTPUT MENU]
       Output Main Menu - CNH           [FBCNH OUTPUTS MAIN MENU]
       Outputs for Unauthorized Claims  [FBUC OUTPUTS]
  
  
 10. MODIFY EXISTING OUTPUTS TO DISPLAY NEW INVOICE/CLAIM DATA
  
     This patch modifies many existing outputs to include some of the new
     invoice data elements that are being collected.  Some of these outputs
     have more than one format depending on the type of invoice being
     displayed.  For example, the List Items in Batch output has three
     different formats.  One format for Outpatient/Ancillary invoices,
     another for Pharmacy invoices, and a third for CH/CNH (civil
     hospital/community nursing home) invoices.
  
     The modified outputs (formats) are listed below along with the 
     options that can be used to generate them.
     a. List Items in Batch (Outpatient/Ancillary, Pharmacy, CH/CNH)
          Close-out Batch [FBAA CLOSE BATCH]
          Pricer Batch Release [FBCH PRICER RELEASE] - only CH/CNH format

 11. FPPS PAYMENT ADVICE INTERFACE 
  
     This patch adds a new interface with the Fee Payment Processing System
     (FPPS) located at the Health Administration Center (HAC).  VistA Fee
     Basis will transmit invoice data to FPPS for EDI claims so FPPS can
     generate the electronic remittance advice to the vendor as required
     by HIPAA regulations.
  
     An invoice will be automatically queued to be transmitted to FPPS when
     one of the following events occurs.
     o Payment confirmation/cancellation message is received from the
       Austin Automation Center for an invoice that was identified as
       an EDI claim from the FPPS system.
     o An invoice with a total amount paid of $0.00 is released with the
       Release a Batch [FBAA SUPERVISOR RELEASE] option and that invoice
       was identified as an EDI claim from the FPPS system.
     o A previously transmitted invoice is edited using the edit options on
       the FPPS Update & Transmit Menu [FB FPPS UPDATE MENU].  See 
       paragraph 12 of patch description for more information.
     o A re-transmit of an invoice is requested using the Transmit Invoices
       to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT] option.
  
     This patch introduces a new file, FPPS QUEUED INVOICES (#163.5) to
     track invoices that have been queued for transmission to FPPS.
  
     A new menu has been added to hold options that are related to the 
     interface with FPPS. The menu is the FPPS Update & Transmit Menu [FB
     FPPS UPDATE MENU] which is attached to the Supervisor Main Menu [FBAA
     SUPERVISOR OPTIONS].  The following options are attached to this new
     menu.
  
           Outpatient/Ancillary Invoice Edit [FBAA FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
              **> Locked with FBAASUPERVISOR
           Pharmacy Invoice Edit [FBRX FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
              **> Locked with FBAASUPERVISOR
           Inpatient Invoice Edit [FBCH FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
              **> Locked with FBAASUPERVISOR
           Audit Report for FPPS Data [FB FPPS AUDIT REPORT]
           Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT]
              **> Locked with FBAASUPERVISOR
           Report of Transmissions to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT REPORT]
           Purge Message Text [FB FPPS PURGE]
              **> Locked with FBAASUPERVISOR
  
     The first four options on the menu are described in item 12 of the 
     patch description (EXCEPTION HANDLING).  The last three options are
     described below.
  
     Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT]
     OPTION DESCRIPTION:
       This option transmits invoice data to the Fee Payment Processing
       System (FPPS) located at the Health Administration Center (HAC) so
       FPPS can send electronic remittance advice to the vendor for claims
       that were electronically submitted to VA.
   
       This option can be scheduled (with no output device needed) or it
       can be run interactively from a menu. If scheduled, it will transmit
       all pending invoices. If run interactively, the user is given an
       option to transmit a selected invoice or all pending invoices.  If
       necessary, an invoice that has been previously sent to FPPS can be
       re-transmitted by selecting it.  
  
       When all pending invoices are sent, a summary message will be mailed
       to the FEE mail group.
  
     The messages are generated using the VistA HL7 package.  The HL7
     package sends them to the VistA Interface Engine located at the
     site.  The local VistA Interface Engine sends the messages to the
     Interface Engine located at the HAC.
  
     Report of Transmissions to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT REPORT] 
     OPTION DESCRIPTION
       This option generates a report of fee invoices transmitted to the
       VistA HL7 package for delivery to the Fee Payment Processing System 
       (FPPS) at the Health Administration Center (HAC).
  
       Note that the count displayed under the Accepted By Interface Engine
       column will only reflect acknowledgements received prior to the most
       recent transmit of all pending invoices.  This is because the check
       for acknowledgements is performed at the beginning of the transmit
       all pending process.  Therefore, if the user-specified period
       includes the date of the most recent transmit, the recently
       transmitted invoices will be included in the counts under the 
       Payment Confirm and Payment Cancelled columns, but not under the
       Accepted By Interface Engine column.  This is because VistA Fee
       Basis will not yet have checked to see if those invoices were
       acknowledged.
  
    Purge Message Text [FB FPPS PURGE]
    OPTION DESCRIPTION
       When an invoice is transmitted to FPPS via the HL7 package, a copy
       of the HL7 message text is saved in the FPPS QUEUED INVOICES 
       (#163.5) file.
   
       This option purges the message text for invoices transmitted prior
       to a specified date.  Messages that have not been accepted by the
       VistA Interface Engine will not be purged unless there is a later
       message for the same invoice number that has been accepted.
  
  
 12. EXCEPTION HANDLING 
  
     This patch adds three new edit options, a new file, and a report to
     support exception handling. The edit options can be used to edit VistA
     invoices that have previously been transmitted to FPPS in the event
     that FPPS reports an exception because of incorrect data. Only the
     FPPS Claim ID and FPPS Line Item can be changed.  The edit options are
     locked with the FBAASUPERVISOR security key. If the invoice is changed
     then it will be automatically queued to be resent to FPPS.  An audit
     log of changes is maintained in the new FEE BASIS FPPS AUDIT (#163.7)
     file. The four options are attached to the new FPPS Update & Transmit 
     Menu [FB FPPS UPDATE MENU].
  
     Outpatient/Ancillary Invoice Edit [FBAA FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
     OPTION DESCRIPTION
       This option is used to edit an outpatient or ancillary invoice that
       has previously been transmitted to FPPS.  If changes are made, the
       invoice will be queued to be resent to FPPS.  
  
     Pharmacy Invoice Edit [FBRX FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
     OPTION DESCRIPTION
       This option is used to edit a pharmacy invoice that has previously
       been transmitted to FPPS.  If changes are made, the invoice will be
       queued to be resent to FPPS.
  
     Inpatient Invoice Edit [FBCH FPPS EDIT INVOICE]
     OPTION DESCRIPTION
       This option is used to edit an inpatient (civil hospital or
       community nursing home) invoice that has previously been transmitted
       to FPPS. If changes are made, the invoice will be queued to be
       resent to FPPS.  
  
     Audit Report for FPPS Data [FB FPPS AUDIT REPORT]
     OPTION DESCRIPTION
       This option generates a report from the FEE BASIS FPPS AUDIT file.  
       This file contains an audit log of changes made to an invoice using
       special edit options.  The options allow editing of selected data
       after the invoice has been transmitted to FPPS to resolve
       exceptions.  
  
  
 13. FIX ENTER PAYMENT OPTION (NOIS ISW-1102-22099)
  
     Two different faults exist in the Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT] 
     option.  These faults only cause a problem in the following situation.
     A user is entering a new payment and the system detects that it is a
     potential duplicate.  If the user decides not to continue entering the
     new payment and instead edits the pre-existing payment then the code
     in DOEDIT^FBAACO3 is used for the edit.  The prompts would look like
     the following.
  
       Service selected for that date already in system.
       Do you want to add another service for the SAME DATE? No// NO
       Want to edit it? No// YES
  
     fault 1 - not all appropriate fields are asked/updated because the
        variable DR(1,162.03,3) is overwritten.  The AMOUNT SUSPENDED, 
        SUSPEND CODE, DESCRIPTION OF SUSPENSION, DATE CORRECT INVOICE
        REC'D, and VENDOR INVOICE DATE fields are not asked.
  
     fault 2 - If the service provided (CPT/HCPCS code) starts with a 
        letter then a ?? is displayed to the screen and the edit
        does not occur.
  
     This patch corrects both these faults.
       NOIS ISW-1102-22099
  
  
 14. FIX PAYMENT LOOK-UP FOR MEDICAL VENDOR
  
     The Payment Look-up for Medical Vendor [FBAA VENDOR LOOKUP] option can
     inappropriately exclude payments from the output.  This option only
     lists payments that have been finalized.  If the report finds a 
     payment that was not finalized for a given date of service, vendor, 
     and patient then it will stop looking at payments for the same date of
     service, vendor, and patient.  However, there could be other payments
     that have been finalized and should be included in the report.
  
     This patch corrects the report so it examines all the payments for a 
     given date of service, vendor, and patient.
  
     The problem was discovered during testing and is not associated with a
     NOIS.
  
  
 15. FIX ICD CODE PROMPT FOR CIVIL HOSPITAL INVOICE (NOIS SAJ-1003-70752)
  
     When civil hospital invoices are entered or edited the software is  
     inappropriately requiring entry of a fifth code whenever four ICD
     codes have been entered.  This problem occurs with both the diagnosis
     code (ICD5 prompt) and the procedure code (PROC5 prompt). The software
     displays "Invalid Code" when no value is entered at these prompts and
     doesn't allow the user to continue until a value is entered.
  
     Example of problem for diagnosis code
     ICD5:  Invalid Code
     ICD5:  Invalid Code 
     ICD5: ^
       EXIT NOT ALLOWED
  
     This problem occurs within the following three options
       Enter Invoice/Payment [FBCH ENTER PAYMENT]
       Invoice Edit [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT]
       Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
     This problem was introduced by patch FB*3.5*55 (CODE SET VERSIONING)
     which was released on SEP 24,2003.  Patch FB*3.5*61 corrects the 
     software so a value does not have to be entered at the ICD5 and PROC5 
     prompts.
  
 ====================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ======================
  
 If installed during the normal workday it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
   Civil Hospital Main Menu         [FBCH MAIN MENU] 
   Community Nursing Home Main Menu [FBCNH MAIN MENU]
   Medical Fee Main Menu            [FBAA MEDICAL MAIN MENU]
   Pharmacy Fee Main Menu           [FBAA PHARMACY MAIN MENU]
   Telephone Inquiry Menu           [FB PHONE MENU]
   Unauthorized Claim Main Menu     [FBUC MAIN] 
  
  
 Install Time -
   The estimated install time for this patch is approximately 10 minutes.
  
  1.  PLACE NEW FBHL GLOBAL
      ---------------------
      This patch introduces a new global ^FBHL.  This global is recommended
      for journaling.  The global will contain a list of VistA invoices 
      that are awaiting transmission or have been transmitted to FPPS. It
      will also contain a copy of the HL7 data transmitted to FPPS.
  
      This global will start with no data and grow as EDI claims are
      processed. Each EDI invoice transmitted to FPPS will take
      approximately 1K bytes of space in the new global.  About half of
      this space can be recovered using the Purge Message Text [FB FPPS
      PURGE] option. Only a small percentage of health care claims are
      expected to be submitted to VA Medical Centers via EDI in October
      2003.  Over time, this percentage will grow.  CHAMPVA currently
      receives 30% of their claims via EDI.   It is not uncommon for a 
      medical center to enter from 10,000 to 30,000 total invoices in VistA
      Fee Basis each year.  The size of the FBHL global will depend on the
      percentage of claims that are submitted via EDI.
  
      This global should be placed in appropriate translation tables.
  
      It is suggested that journaling be enabled.
  
      The FBHL global MUST be placed with appropriate protections prior to 
      installing the KIDS distribution.  The protections should be the same
      as those for the existing FB namespaced globals.
  
  2.  RETRIEVE THE KIDS DISTRIBUTION HOST FILE
      ----------------------------------------
      This patch will be distributed in a host file due to the size of the
      patch.  The name of the host file is FEE3_5P61.KID.
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The FEE3_5P61.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
      The filename for the Fee Basis User Manual Replacement pages is
      FEE3_5P61UM.PDF.  Use Binary Mode when downloading the file.
  
  
  3.  LOAD TRANSPORT GLOBAL
      ---------------------
      Load the KIDS distribution that is contained in file FEE3_5P61.KID
      using the Load a Distribution option on the Installation menu.
  
  4.  DISABLE ROUTINE MAPPING   (DSM for Open VMS sites only) 
      -----------------------
      Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in 
      step 5 below.  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in 
      your mapped routine set, please skip this step.

      scheduled to run on a daily basis at a local time that is equivalent
      to 23:00 Central Time.  This timing will transmit payment
      confirmations to FPPS shortly after they have been received from the
      AAC, but before FPPS runs it's daily job to generate HIPAA 835
      remittance advice transactions.
  
      The Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] option can be used to
      schedule the task.  Do not specify an output device.  A mail message
      will be sent to the FEE mail group with results each time the task
      runs.
