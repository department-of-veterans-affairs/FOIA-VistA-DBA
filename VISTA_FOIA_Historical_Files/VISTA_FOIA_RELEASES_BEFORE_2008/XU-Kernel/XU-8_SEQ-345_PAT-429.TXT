Subject: NEED TO CHECK NPI QUEUED TASK

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Mr. Feeley, Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and
 Management, has requested interim updates on the progress for entering 
 National Provider Identifier values into VistA.  Patch XU*8*420 attempted 
 to create a recurring task for this purpose using a scheduled option.
 After the patch was released it was found that the date/time for the task
 could not be set during an installation.
  
 We are asking that AS SOON AS POSSIBLE each site check the setting for 
 this task and update it if necessary (it may be updated to insure the 
 task is run even if it is currently set for the correct date and time).
  
 In VA FileManager you can do a inquire or an edit.  The following capture 
 shows 
   1) an Inquire for an entry which does not have the "QUEUED TO RUN AT 
      WHAT TIME" field (#2) set.  
      
   2) an Edit to set this field to the current date at 8 pm to generate 
      a test run that evening, which will then set the date properly after 
      it has run. 
      
   3) an Inquire to establish that the field was set and a task is now set
      as well.
      
 The value established for the "RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY" field (#6) is 
 correct as it is.
