Subject: VITALS GUI ERROR UPON CVP DATA ENTRY & GRID/GRAPH BLANKING ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will address 2 PATIENT SAFTETY ISSUES.
      
 #1 - PSI-06-055:
 If the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for the local File 120.51 (GMRV VITALS
 TYPE) differs from the 120.51 Standardized file from the development
 account, an error may occur in the Vitals GUI software alerting the user
 that there is an invalid vital type if it does not exist.  There is a
 possibility that the IEN could exist but represent a different Vital Type.
      
 #2 - PSI-06-070:
 Prior to the release of GMRV*5*3, if the user single clicked on a new
 patient, the right hand side of the screen would be blanked out 
 (signifying that the user was in the process of selecting another 
 patient.)  After the release of GMRV*5*3, the blanking out of the Vitals 
 input side (the right side) of the screen does not happen.  If the
 user single clicks on the new patient, the Vitals input portion of the 
 screen remains in focus and available for the old (original patient)
 until the new patient is selected with a double-click.  This causes 
 some confusion for the user.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 Problem #1:  HD0000000141781
 ----------
 During Vitals GUI entry, the user will possibly receive an error 
 indicating an incorrect vital type and/or possibly record vitals data 
 to an incorrect vitals type.
      
 The GUI Vitals software currently expects consistency of IENs in all 
 environments.  While data standardization currently has File 120.51 
 (GMRV VITALS TYPE) locked down, it is possible to have sites that 
 modified this file in the past.
               
 Resolution #1:
 -------------
 A modification will be made to the Vitals GUI software to modify how it
 currently reviews the IEN's from File 120.51 (GMRV VITALS TYPE) on the
 user's site. 
  
      
 Problem #2:  HD0000000145709
 ----------
 When selecting a new patient for Vitals entry, the previous patient 
 grid/graph data is not blanked out from the right side of the screen when 
 the new patient is highlighted via a single mouse click, as was previously 
 done before patch GMRV*5*3 was released.  This causes the user to believe 
 a new patient has been selected on a single mouse click.  
      
 Resolution #2:
 -------------
 A modification will be made to the Vitals GUI to combine disabling the 
 "Enter Vitals" button with hiding the Grid/Graph. So the patient data 
 will be visible only if the selected patient and patient focused are the 
 same.
      
 A Post - Init routine will be included with this patch to update systems 
 parameters relating to the Vitals GUI version.

 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
 ==================
 The KIDS build is attached to this message.
       
 The file in this patch is VITL5_P18.EXE.  Use Binary to download the file.
       
 Sites may retrieve this EXE file in one of the following ways:
       
 (1)     The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
       
         download.vista.med.va.gov
       
         This will transmit the files from the first available FTP Server.
       
 (2)     Sites may also elect to retrieve the software directly from a 
         specific Server as follows:
       
   CIO FIELD OFFICE      FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
