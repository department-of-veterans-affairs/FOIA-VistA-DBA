XU*8.0*290, BCMA Contingence Support has some undesirable side-effects 
described below.  SD&D is reviewing the situation and determining whether this 
patch should be entered in error.  Unless there is a pressing need (e.g., a 
critical patch dependency), it is recommended that sites DO NOT INSTALL this 
patch until further notice.
 
Description of problem:
Per NOIS BRX-0603-11451, after the install of the patch the XU USER TERMINATE 
option loses functionality used by national patches and local software that 
should occur upon the termination of a user. 
 
Here is an example of XU USER TERMINATE **before** the patch:
NAME: XU USER TERMINATE
  MENU TEXT: User terminate event       TYPE: extended action
  CREATOR: XXXX
 DESCRIPTION:   This is a protocol to link other packages that want to 
know about a USER TERMINATE event. Other packages can attach to this
protocol option and they will be called when a USER is Terminated.  DUZ
will be the person that is running the terminate option.  XUIFN will point
to the NEW PERSON file entry that is being terminated.
It is called from XUSTERM2.  
 
ITEM: USR USER TERMINATE
ITEM: GMRC TERMINATE CLEANUP
ITEM: OR TERMINATE CLEANUP
ITEM: PRCS TERMINATE
ITEM: TIU TEMPLATE USER DELETE
 
After the patch is installed, there will be no records in the ITEM multiple.
 
If a site needs to install this patch before SD&D determines whether or not to 
enter this patch in error, it is recommended that the following steps be used:
1. Electronically save the current (before patch) Standard Captioned 
   Output for the XU USER TERMINATE record in the OPTION file.
2. Follow the patch install instructions for XU*8.0*290
3. Manually re-populate the MENU multiple of the OPTION file with values 
   that existed before the patch.
