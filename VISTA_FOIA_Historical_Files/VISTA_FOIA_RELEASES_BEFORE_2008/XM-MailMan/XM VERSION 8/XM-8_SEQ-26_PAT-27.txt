 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1. UNY-0704-10102 - DIQUIET Variable not Newed or Killed in Mailman 
                     Routines
  
    Problem
    -------
    Sometimes, when a user exits an imaging option, and enters a patient 
    related option, they no longer see necessary identifiers to identify 
    patients with similar names. It has been indicated that this is caused
    by the variable DIQUIET not being NEWed by all software applications.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Routines XMRMSM, XMRONT, and XMRUCX have been modified to NEW the 
    DIQUIET variable before calling any ^DIC* routines.

 PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==============================
 You should kill the job running your TCP/IP listener for MailMan before
 installing this patch.  It runs on port 25 and can be found by viewing 
 the system status utility for your operating system.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the Mailman package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XM*8.0*27):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XM*8.0*27.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted, Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO// respond No.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 Restart the TCP/IP listener for MailMan using your 
 local operating procedure.
