Subject: FIX FOR DOME80 ERROR AND RE-RELEASE OF NATIONAL DEPRESSION SCREENING REMINDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Description:
 ===========
 This patch fixes the error with the DOM80 Mental Health test in a Reminder 
 Dialog described in NOIS call CIN-0503-40167. Currently, when running a DOM80 
 Mental Health Test from a Reminder Dialog in CPRS, the variable DFN does not 
 get set for the DOM80 test, which causes an undefined variable error. This 
 patch changes the code in PXRMDLR to set the DFN for all Mental Health 
 tests and if the DFN is null, to quit out of the code. 
 
 This patch is also re-releasing the national VA-DEPRESSION SCREENING 
 reminder. The changes to this Reminder include a new ICD9 in the 
 VA-Depression Screening taxonomy and changes the Reminder's Due in Advance 
 Timeframe to one month. PXRMP19I will run as a post-install routine to 
 unpack the National reminder. This routine will be deleted when the install 
 is completed.
