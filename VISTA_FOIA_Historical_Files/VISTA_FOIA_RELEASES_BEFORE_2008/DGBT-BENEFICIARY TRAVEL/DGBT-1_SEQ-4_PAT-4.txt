  REN-0503-61121     Concerns about patch DGBT*1*2
    
     Problem:
     ========
   
     Site has concerns about installation instructions for patch DGBT*1*2
     item number 8.  POC and Chief IRM are unhappy with the instructions.
     POC e-mailed the following:
  
     Here is the instruction from patch DGBT*1*2
  
       "8.  AFTER INSTALLATION
            ==================
        After the installation, schedule the 'Update Local Vendor (COREFLS)
        menu to run weekly, or bi-weekly.  Queue the menu under POSTMASTER
        (DUZ = .5), giving POSTMASTER the DGBT LOCAL VENDOR key."
   
     Instructing users to hack the system is unacceptable. If there is a 
     problem with scheduling this option in the standard manner, it should
     be resolved by OI, not by giving users incomplete instructions on
     hacking the system.
   
     Solution:
     ===========
   
    1)Removed the options DGBT LOCAL VENDOR ADD and 
      DGBT LOCAL VENDOR UPDATE from the DGBT BENE TRAVEL MENU.
    2)Removed the Key DGBT LOCAL VENDOR from DGBT LOCAL VENDOR ADD
      and DGBT LOCAL VENDOR UPDATE options.
    3)Created a new menu DGBT LOCAL VENDOR MENU with options
      DGBT LOCAL VENDOR ADD and DGBT LOCAL VENDOR UPDATE.
  
 OPTIONS:
     DGBT BENE TRAVEL ACCOUNT, DGBT BENE TRAVEL CERTIFICATION
     DGBT BENE TRAVEL DISTANCES, DGBT BENE TRAVEL RATES, 
     DGBT BENE TRAVEL REPORT, DGBT BENE TRAVEL REPRINT,
     DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN, DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW,
     DGBT LOCAL VENDOR ADD, DGBT LOCAL VENDOR UPDATE
  
 MENUS:
    DGBT BENE TRAVEL MENU, DGBT LOCAL VENDOR MENU
