Subject: RAI DYNAMIC ROUTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 The dynamic routing of the HL7 interface between VISTA and the Resident 
 Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) software (Accu-Med) is
 enhanced to eliminate the need to manually pre-define facility specific
 HL7 protocols. Dynamic addressing features are not well suited for HL7
 messaging with commercial systems, such as Accu-Med and VISTA. Therefore,
 this enhancement to the dynamic addressing functionality will eliminate
 the need to manually pre-define facility specific HL7 protocols.
  
 Note: This patch will add the following protocols:
  
 DGRU-RAI-A01
 DGRU-RAI-A02
 DGRU-RAI-A03
 DGRU-RAI-A08
 DGRU-RAI-A11
 DGRU-RAI-A12
 DGRU-RAI-A13
 DGRU-RAI-A21
 DGRU-RAI-A22
 DGRU-RAI-MFU
  
 No protocols are edited or deleted.
  
 It is important to keep in mind that the set up of division(s), RAI 
 subscription control numbers, HL7 Logical Links, HL7 Application 
 Parameters and other implementation instructions outlined in the original 
 patch DG*5.3*109 and in user reference manuals remains unchanged.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums after patch
 installation.
   
  Note:  This patch should be installed during a time of low system 
         activity.
  
  Note:  DG*5.3*473 and HL*1.6*93 are REQUIRED builds for this KIDS 
         distribution. KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
         without the prior installation of them.
  
     1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
   
     2.  Install the KIDS build onto your system as follows:
   
         - Using Mailman, read the KIDS build message.
         - At the 'Enter message action' prompt, enter 'INSTALL/CHECK
           MESSAGE' and press RETURN.
         - At the 'OK to continue with Load?' prompt enter 'YES' and press
          RETURN.
         - You will be asked 'Want to continue with Load?' immediately
           before installation begins.  If you want to continue, enter
           'YES' and press RETURN.  If you wish to stop, enter 'NO' and
           press RETURN.
   
     3.  Check the integrity of the just loaded build, and compare this
         build to the software on your system.  You will need to use the
         following options (which are all on the 'Installation [XPD
         INSTALLATION MENU]' menu option):
   
          - VERIFY CHECKSUMS IN TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routine(s) that are in the
            transport global using calculated checksums for every routine.
            If the transport global checksums are incorrect, do not
            continue with installation, and contact the patch developer
            for a new patch.  If the checksums are correct, continue to
            the next step.
   
          - BACKUP A TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
          - COMPARE TRANSPORT GLOBAL TO CURRENT SYSTEM - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
            patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch,
            including routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.
   
          - PRINT TRANSPORT GLOBAL - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
         If all the above steps have been done, continue to the following
         steps.
   
     4.  AXP/DSM SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If the
         routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
         should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
     5.  The patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
         system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
         global. This is done using the 'Installation' menu's 'Install
         Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD]' menu option. When using this
         menu option to install the patch build, you will be asked
         several questions.  The questions, and the answers you should
         supply, are shown below.
   
         When prompted 'Select INSTALL NAME:' respond with DG*5.3*501.
         
         When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?
         YES//', respond NO.
  
         When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols?  YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
         options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
         DG ADMIT PATIENT                Admit a Patient
         DG TRANSFER PATIENT             Transfer a Patient
         DG DISCHARGE PATIENT            Discharge a Patient
         DG BED CONTROL EXTENDED         Extended bed Control
  
         No protocols will be placed out of order at this time.
   
    6.   AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: After the patch has been installed, rebuild
         your map set, if necessary.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - DGRUDYN

 The HLL("LINKS") array is used to dynamically specify recipients of the 
 patient movement and update messages.  HLP("SUBSCRIBER") is added to 
 specify the receiving application and receiving facility for the MSH 
 segment of the HL7 message.
  
 In addition, the entry point for master file updating is enhanced to use 
 the HLL("LINKS") and HLP("SUBSCRIBER") information when Master File 
 Updates are sent from VistA to RAI/MDS.
