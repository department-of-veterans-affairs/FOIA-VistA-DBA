Associated patches: (v)DI*22*89    <<= must be installed BEFORE `DI*22*143'

Subject: DUZ Authentication

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
   When starting VA FileMan, in Programmer mode, from any of the 
 following entry points:
  
  ^DI
  C^DI
  D^DI
  P^DI
  Q^DI
  
 If the local variable DUZ was undefined, it would be set to 0(zero).  
 FileMan will now check to see if the New Person(#200) file exists and if 
 it does, FileMan will call the Kernel to ask for the user's ACCESS CODE.  
 If a valid ACCESS CODE is entered the "Select OPTION:" prompt will be
 displayed.  On the other hand, if the ACCESS CODE is invalid, then the 
 user will be prompted to make a selection from the NEW PERSON(#200) 
 file.  The only valid users are those who's DUZ is one(1) or greater and 
 who have a valid ACCESS CODE.  If the NEW PERSON(#200) file does not
 exist, that is Stand Alone VA FileMan mode, then the DUZ will be set to
 0(zero).
