  PATCH DESCRIPTION:   
   
  This patch modifies the VistA portion of the Library Package to Year 2000 
  standards.  Routines LBRYPPR and LBRYUTL have been modified to include the 
  needed Leap Century/Year checks.  The menu option 'Check-In' [LBRY SERIALS 
  CHECK-IN] and the scheduled option 'SEND LIBRARY TRANSACTIONS' [LBRY TRAN 
  SEND] which utilize these changes should not visibly be affected.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
  ========================== 
  
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize 
  disruption to users.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes. 
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed 
      from the mapped set at this time. 
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu. 
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LBR*2.5*6): 
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. 
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option 
           will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the 
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.). 
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in 
           the transport global. 
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
           the components of the KIDS build. 
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      LBR*2.5*6. 
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      And Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
      Options you would like to place out of order, enter the following: 
  
            LBRY MANAGER              Library Management 
            LBRY TRAN SEND            SEND LIBRARY TRANSACTIONS 
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.  
  
  8.  Delete the environment check routine after successful patch installation. 
      Delete all LBR256* routines.
