Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation.  PFSS will initially be implemented
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing 
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 These PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS On/Off 
 Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".  The ability for 
 the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at the 
 appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 patch.

 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Functional Description
 ======================
 EAS*1*67 provides an enhancement for the Enrollment Application System 
 package to support HL7 queries for a determination of a patient's Long 
 Term Care (LTC) status and monthly maximum amounts that can be charged to 
 a patient.  There are no user interface changes as all HL7 processing and 
 messaging is done by background jobs triggered by the HL7 package.
  
   
   
 Technical Description
 =====================
 EASPFSS is a new routine to process inbound HL7 messages.  It will parse 
 the message, calculate the patient's LTC status and file the data in the 
 new EAS LTC MONTHLY MAX CALCULATIONS (#714.5) file.  This file is used to 
 store the response to the remote system to be prepared by the VISTA Data 
 Extraction Framework (VDEF) package.
