Description: 
============

 This patch contains the following problem resolutions:
    
 NOTE: All of the following problems pertain to the following menu option:
  
       UTL *..Utility Options ...
         CC Create State Data Disk
  
  1) NOIS ALB-0199-50398 MISSING RIGHT PARENTHESIS ERROR
     NOIS ALB-0199-51044 Create State Data Disk Error
     NOIS STL-0199-42121 ABORT
     NOIS BIR-0199-31475 ERROR WHEN RUNNING STATE REPORT
     NOIS DAY-0199-41635 Missing Right Parenthesis
     NOIS CTX-0199-71346 Missing Right Parenthesis Error
  
     1) Version 5.1 of the VAACCR 5966 Characters (VA Registry)
     2) Version 6.0 of the NAACCR 5966 Characters        
     3) Version 5.1 of the NAACCR 5966 Characters
  
     Usage of the above versions of the data extract would cause the package
     to abort with a "missing right parenthesis" or "null subscript" error.
  
     This has been fixed.
  
  2) INCORRECT RECORD TYPE
  
     1) Version 5.1 of the VAACCR 5966 Characters (VA Registry)
     2) Version 6.0 of the NAACCR 5966 Characters
  
     The above state reporting record layouts contained an incorrect Record
     Type value of "I".  The correct Record Type value is "A".
  
     This has been fixed.
  
  3) NOIS PRO-0299-11987 NCARR FORMAT
     FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT SITE SPECIFIC FIELDS
  
     (all versions)
  
     The following fields became "site specific" in 1998. Consequently, 
     1998 data was not being extracted correctly:
  
     SURGICAL APPROACH            (#165.5, #74)   ROADS 186
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE      (#165.5, #58.2) ROADS 187
     SURGICAL MARGINS             (#165.5, #59)   ROADS 191
     SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY  (#165.5, #138)  ROADS 192
     NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED      (#165.5, #140)  ROADS 193
     SURGERY OF OTHER SITES/NODES (#165.5, #139)  ROADS 194
     RECONSTRUCTION/RESTORATION   (#165.5,  #23)  ROADS 195
     RECON/RESTORE - DELAYED      (#165.51, #33)  ROADS 266A                 
  
     This has been fixed. 
  
  4) CAUSE OF DEATH
  
     (all versions)
     
     If the Cause of Death value was 7777 (State death certificate or 
     listing not available) or 7797 (State death cert available, cause
     of death not coded), the data was not being extracted correctly.
  
     This has been fixed.
