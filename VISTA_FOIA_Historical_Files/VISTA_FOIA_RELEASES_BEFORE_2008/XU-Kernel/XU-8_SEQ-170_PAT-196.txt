Description: 
============

 NOIS CPH-0301-43012
      CPH-0301-43024
 Site was getting a null subscript error when a requesting site that did
 not have a station number in the institution file (#4) made a RDV request
 to the site. This was fixed by checking for the station number when the
 request is made to prevent sending a invalid request.  At the remote site
 a second set of check are made to see that all the needed parameters are
 in place before starting to log the visit.
