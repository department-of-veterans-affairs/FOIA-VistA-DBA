 KNOWN DEFECT
 =========================================================================
 There is a known defect in this patch.  The defect was found to be minimal
 due to the low occurrence of having the data problem and it is not cause to
 delay the release of this patch. 
 
 Due to a conversion introduced by Medicine version 2.3, some Non-Endoscopic
 records have incorrect pointer references in the Medical Patient file (#690).
 The conversion converted the entries from the Endoscopy/Consult file (#699)
 to the Generalized Procedures/Consult file (#699.5).  The global location
 of the procedures was changed from MCAR(699 to MCAR(699.5.  The cross
 reference to the entries was not updated completely.  These records will
 not be able to be converted to Clinical Procedures Reports.
                                                                 
 If your site generates the "BAD MEDICINE FILE POINTER" error, please enter
 a Remedy ticket stating this error.  A utility routine will be available to
 correct the problems found on your system.
 ==========================================================================
                                                                         
 
 I.  INTERFACES AND DEPENDENCIES:
     ===========================
 This patch requires the installation of patches, TIU*1*182, GMRC*3*37,
 and MAG*3*47.  It will load the Transport Global but will not install.
 Patch TIU*1*182 provides the necessary routine changes and standardized
 TIU document titles that patch MD*1*5 will need for the Medicine report
 conversion.  Patch MAG*3*47 provides the routine changes for the
 conversion to map the image linked to the Medicine report to a TIU document.
 Patch GMRC*3*37 will provide the routine changes for the conversion to map
 any procedure associated with a Medicine report to the converted document.
  
 Patch MD*1*5 will load the options and routines needed to convert the 
 Medicine Reports to Clinical Procedures reports. This patch can be
 installed even if the site does not want to convert their reports right
 away.  It provides the tools to convert the reports.
                                                                       
 If your site does not have Medicine, you can still install this patch.
 There is a post-init routine MDPOST5 which will check whether Medicine
 Version 2.3 exists.  If your site does not have Medicine Version 2.3,
 the conversion options will be out of order once they are sent to the site
 during the patch installation.  Whether your site has Medicine Version 2.3 
 or not, the routines and database changes in the KIDS build will be loaded.
 This post-init routine will be deleted once it is executed during the
 installation.                                    
  
 If your site still uses the interfaces provided by patch MC*2.3*24,
 you can still install this patch.  By installing this patch, reports will 
 not be converted to TIU documents.  There is a Conversion Guide which will
 go into details on the setup of the Medicine Report Conversion parameters,
 the conversion, and report and summary that can assist in resolving
 problems during the conversion.
 
 If there are medical devices sending data to the Medicine files, the site
 will not be able to convert until the medical device is implemented with
 Clinical Procedures.
  
                                                                   
 II.  PATCH DESCRIPTION:
      =================
 The Medicine report will be converted to text format and stored in a
 TIU document.  A CP study will be created for each Medicine report.
 If there are images associated with the report, they
 will be mapped to the TIU document.  If there is a Consult procedure
 associated with the report, the procedure request will be mapped to
 the TIU document.  The TIU document, procedure, and images will be
 linked together by the CP Study.  Each converted report will have
 a visit created along with it that will have a SERVICE TYPE of
 Event (Historical) so no workload will be reported for it. 
                                                     
 This patch will convert the following reports in the medicine files:
 1.     Catheterization
 2.     ECG
 3.     Echo
 4.     EP
 5.     Holter
 6.     ETT
 7.     Surgical Risk Analysis
 8.     Endoscopic
 9.     Non-Endoscopic
 10.    PFT
 11.    Hematology
 12.    Pacemaker
 13.    V-Lead Implant
 14.    A-Lead Implant
 15.    Rheumatology
 16.    Generalized Procedures
  
 Only records in the following statuses will be converted:
  
 RELEASED ON-LINE VERIFIED
 RELEASED OFF-LINE VERIFIED
 RELEASED NOT VERIFIED
 RELEASED ON-LINE VERIFIED OF SUPERSEDED
 RELEASED OFF-LINE VERIFIED OF SUPERSEDED
  
 Records in the DRAFT, PROBLEM DRAFT, and SUPERSEDED will
 not be converted.
                                                        
 RELEASED NOT VERIFIED records will be converted to a 
 Clinical Procedure document with a CONVERTED ARCHIVED REPORT
 status within the text of the document.
  
 Medicine reports or interpretations added to the Medicine file
 from a medicine device that uses the interfaces in patch MC*2.3*24
 can also be converted.  These reports will not have a status.  There is a
 parameter setup question,"CONVERT IF NO STATUS".  If it is set to "YES", 
 reports without statuses can be converted.  This parameter is located
 within the Conversion Setup option under each particular procedure.  These
 reports will also be converted to a Clinical Procedure document with a
 CONVERTED ARCHIVED REPORT status within the text of the document.
                                                               
                                                       
 NOIS FIX
 ========
 MOU-1004-30312  (HD#68314)
 Modified Routines: MDRPCOT, and MDRPCOT1
                                                                         
 Mountain Home reported getting a "No Location" printed as the Hospital  
 Location in the TIU document that was created by Clinical Procedures.     
 This happens when there is no Hospital Location entered for the           
 CP Definition.  When CP creates the TIU documents, there is no location
 to use.  Patch MD*1*5 will resolve this problem.  If the Hospital Location 
 field in the CP Definition is omitted inadvertently, the hospital location
 of the appointment selected during the CP study check-in will be used to
 create the TIU note.  If no appointment exists, the note will not be        
 created.                                                                  
        
                                                                               
 III.  FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES:
       =====================
    
 VIEWING CONVERTED REPORTS
 =========================
 Users can view the text of the converted Medicine reports in CPRS Reports
 tab, Consults tab, and Imaging Display.
                                                 
 The converted report will be available according to the Medicine procedure
 name with " - HIST" appended at the end to indicate that it is a
 converted historical report.
 
 The text of the converted report will be in a TIU document with a historical
 procedure title and the following legal verbiage as the header:
                         
 ****************************************************************
 This information was imported from the Medicine Package
 software and does not include an electronic signature;
 therefore, it is being administratively closed and
 should be used as information only.  
 ****************************************************************
  
 If the Medicine report was associated with a Consult procedure, NOTHING is
 changed with the Consult procedure name.  Sites can still look up the
 report by the Consult procedure name.  The only difference is that the 
 Consult procedure will reference a TIU document rather than a Medicine
 report.                                                        
                                                                     
 If there are images associated with the Medicine report, the images will
 be associated with the converted document after the conversion.  The users
 can view the converted document and the images using Imaging Display.
 
 Once the Medicine report is converted over to a CP text document, the 
 converted CP text report WILL be available to be viewed and the Medicine 
 report WILL NOT be available to be viewed in CPRS.  The converted reports
 will be available for viewing in the following components in the CPRS
 Reports tab:                                                  
 
 1) Clinical Reports
     Medicine/CP
       Abnormal
       Brief Report
       Full Captioned
       Full Report
       Procedures (local only)
       Procedures
                                                                        
 2) Health Summary

        Medicine Full Captioned [MEDC]
        Medicine Full Report [MEDF]
        Medicine Summary [MEDS]
 
 3) The Procedures (local only) report component can also be found under the
    list of Available Reports.  Users can also view the converted documents
    here as well.
 
 4) Consults tab - If the Medicine report was associated with a consult
    procedure, the converted report will also be available for viewing under
    the Consults tab in CPRS when the procedure is selected.
 
 Routines Modified: MCARPS1, MCARPS3, MCORMN, MCORMN0, MCORMN01, MDPS3
                                                            
 The routines were modified to check whether a Medicine report was converted
 or not.  If it wasn't, the data will be passed to CPRS for display.  If it
 was converted, the CP text data will be passed for display in CPRS.

 POST-LOCKOUT CHANGES
 ====================
 Once all the options are disabled, the user will not be able to associate a
 Medicine report to a Consult procedure.  If the user tries to associate a
 Medicine report with a Consult procedure in CPRS, the user will not get
 a procedure list to select from.  There will be no report for
 association since they are converted over to CP.
  
 Routine Modified: MCARPS2

 FILE ADDED
 ==========
 CP CONVERSION file (#703.9)
 This file is created strictly for the use of storing the site parameters 
 used for the Medicine report conversion and also the conversion status for
 each converted entry.
     
                                                                 
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGE
 ======================
 A new field will be added called CONVERSION ID REFERENCE field (#.3)
 in the CP TRANSACTION file (#702).
 
 702,.3        CONVERSION ID REFERENCE 2;1 FREE TEXT
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>30!($L(X)<1) X

               HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 1-30 characters in length. 
               DESCRIPTION:      This field is the Reference Conversion ID. It
                                 is a variable pointer to the Medicine files.
                                 It indicates which converted Medicine report
                                 record is associated with the CP Transaction
                                 study.  This field helps to keep track which CP
                                 Transaction study was created for the Medicine
                                 report conversion.  This field is a variable
                                 pointer to the following files:

 '*' denotes procedures that can be broken down further into individual 
 procedures.  They are not mapped and the Use TIU Note Title fields are left 
 blank.
 
    The procedures that fall within the three procedure modules denoted by 
    '*' will need to have a corresponding historical title created within
    the HISTORICAL PROCEDURES document class under CLINICAL PROCEDURE
    CLASS by the site.  Use the List of TIU Titles Needed option to
    obtain a list of historical titles that need to be created.  The
    Convert Y/N parameter has to be set to "Yes" for the three
    procedures denoted by '*' to generate the titles needed for the 
    procedures under the three modules.  Any titles created MUST begin
    with the word "HISTORICAL" and end with the word "PROCEDURE".
 
    In addition to the historical titles being mapped, the CP Definition
    field parameter will also be mapped.  A CP Definition will be created
    for each of the Medicine Package Parameter EXCEPT the three denoted
    by '*'.  The name of the CP Definition created will be the same name
    as the Medicine procedure name and " - HIST" appended at the end to
    specify historical.
