Associated patches: (v)AFJX*5.1*6  <<= must be installed BEFORE `AFJX*5.1*15'

Subject: NHE interface with Health Summary

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

     This patch provides for NHE to call into the Health Summary
     package and retrieve the same information and display the
     same data to the NHE users as provided by Health Summary.
  
     This patch makes the software Health Summary and Y2K
     compliant.
  
     Since this software now uses the spooling device, it is
     important to note that a spool device to which Health
     Summary output may be directed, should be entered in the
     Health Summary Parameters File (142.99).  The spooling
     device should be a legal device in the Device File which
     points to a directory and file on the host system.
  
     AFJXADD1 - routine to put 3 additional Type entries (Current
     Order, Surgery Non Or Procedures & Compensation & Pension
     Exams) into file #537015.
  
     This patch will delete all the NHE routines that are no
     longer used for collecting data.

   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
  
    1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation;
       however, it is highly recommended to do the installation
       when a minimal number of users are on the system.
    2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.
    3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? Yes// <return>, respond YES. When prompted to select
                                              ===
       the option(s) you would like to place out of order, enter the
       following:
  
          AFJXNHEX REQUEST
          ================
  
    4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they
       should be unmapped at this time.
    5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
       select the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu,
       you may elect to use the following options:
       a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the Transport Global.
       b. Print Transport Global and Compare Transport Global to the
          Current System - this option will allow you to view all
          changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It
          compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
       c. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
          Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
  
          AFJX*5.1*15.
          ===========
  
    8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 4, the mapped set
       should be rebuilt once the installation has run to completion.
  
  
    9. The following routines would automatically be deleted:
