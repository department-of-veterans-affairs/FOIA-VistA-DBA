Subject: WR DOCUMENTS NOT SENT TO FMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues.
  
 The first issue is incorrect coding in routine RCBEUBIL.  This is not
 causing an error and it doesn't appear to have caused any incorrect data
 in the past but the change is needed to safeguard against any future
 problems.
  
 The second issue is incorrect coding in routine RCBEUTR1.  The code is
 looking at file #430 instead of #433.  If a contractual adjustment is
 made, a Modified Billing Document is being sent to FMS instead of the
 correct Write Off Document.  This problem only affects bills with a 
 category of 30 (tricare) or 32 (tricare third party) AND using a 
 contractual adjustment.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1.    ISH-0604-40854    Incorrect Code in Routine RCBEUBIL
  
       Problem:
       -------
       Corefls Development found the following incorrect codes in 
       routine RCBEUBIL: variable BILLDA should be RCBILLDA 
             FYMULT(RCTRANDA) ; update the fiscal year multiple for bill
             ; to equal the fiscal year multiple for transaction in file 433
             N BILLDA,FYDA
             S BILLDA=$P($G(^PRCA(433,RCTRANDA,0)),"^",2) I 'BILLDA Q
             S FYDA=0
             F S FYDA=$O(^PRCA(433,RCTRANDA,4,FYDA)) Q:'FYDA D
             . I $D(^PRCA(430,RCBILLDA,2,FYDA,0)) S $P(^PRCA(430,RCBILLDA
                  ,2,FYDA,0),"^",2)=$P(^PRCA(433,RCTRANDA,4,FYDA,0),"^",2 
             Q
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       Changed variable BILLDA to RCBILLDA in order to safeguard possible 
       bad data sent from external applications.
  
 2.    ISH-0604-40855    Incorrect Code Found in Routine RCBEUTR1
  
       Problem:
       --------
       The COREFLS Development found the following incorrect code in routine
       RCBEUTR1: the error is at INCDEC+81 in routine RCBEUTR1. The code is
       looking at the wrong node. As a result, any WR documents meeting 
       this requirement will not be sent to FMS.
          . ; category=30 tricare or 32 tricare third party, and contract adj
          . I (CATEG=30!(CATEG=32)),$P($G(^PRCA(430,RCBILLDA,8)),"^",8) D Q
       In the highlighted portion above, the code is looking at the bill 
       file (430) for a contract adjustment. It should be looking at the
       transaction file (433).
  
       Resolution:
       -----------
       Changed the code to read from correct file #433 so that correct FMS 
       document (Write Off Document)will be generated when a contractual
       adjustment is being processed.
