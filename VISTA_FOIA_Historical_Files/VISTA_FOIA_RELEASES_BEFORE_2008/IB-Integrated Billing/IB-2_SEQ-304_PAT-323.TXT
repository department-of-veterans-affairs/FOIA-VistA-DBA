Subject: MRA STATION NUMBER BUG FIX

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will address several bugs related to e-MRA (Medicare Remittance
 Advice) as described in their respective Remedy Tickets.
  
 In various locations of the Integrated Billing (IB) package, e-MRA is
 retrieving the site number incorrectly using the $$SITE^VASITE function.
 As a result, numerous claims using e-MRA have been rejected. This patch
 will modify code that uses this function incorrectly.
  
 Two changes to the e-MRA process have been requested by the Chief 
 Business Office. One change will prevent syntax errors in the
 VistA-to-Austin transmissions of certain MRA secondary claims. The other
 change will enable MRA's to be automatically turned into authorized
 secondary claims without user intervention.
  
 Change request 1: 
 -----------------
 Round the value of LCOB-12 (PAID UNITS) to the nearest integer value.  
 Currently VistA can send a number with decimals to Austin. Austin can only
 accept integers (all numeric).
  
 Change request 2:  
 -----------------
 Add MRA adjustment PR-122 (psych. reduction) to the list of valid
 adjustment group and reason codes to be automatically converted into an
 MRA secondary claim.
  
 MRA claims have been rejected at various location because 
 e-MRA(Trailblazer software) cannot accept punctuation characters in 
 city fields of an address. This patch modifies code for output formatters
 so that any punctuation in an address is stripped off.
  
 BCBS Anthem is denying/not paying MRA secondary professional claims
 printed at express bill because the secondary Provider ID is manually 
 entered on screen 3 <2> of the MRA claim. The Provider ID is not copied
 over to secondary claim when the system automatically creates the claims
 after receiving the MRA from Trailblazer (TB). This patch will modify
 ^IBCU routine to prevent manual deletion or change of the Provider ID 
 when one exist for the primary MRA claim.
  
 When there are 2 MRAs for a claim, and both are split MRAs, (one denied
 and one is processed), the Balance Due calculation for the MRA secondary
 claim to the secondary payer is incorrect because of the way the claim
 Total Charges is retrieved. The Balance Due being sent to the secondary
 payer is much higher than it should be in these cases.

 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. 100796       Box 24K for e-MRA
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Data is incorrectly displayed in the Site Number field of the IBCE EDI
 VIEW/PRINT EXTRACT option screen because the data is being extracted from 
 the INSTITUTION file (#4) instead of the STATION NUMBER file (#389.9).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the EXTRACT CODE (#1) field of the IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION 
 (#364.5) file IEN# 134 N-SITE NUMBER to extract the data from the piece
 [3] of the results of the function $$SITE^VASITE.
  
  
 2. 101145       e-MRA problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The site number was wrong in block 24k on the HCFA 1500 which resulted
 in billing errors/rejects.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify FORMAT CODE (#1) field of the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file 
 and EXTRACT CODE (#1) field in the IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION (#364.5) 
 file IENS# 116, 117, 118, 119, 155 and 231.This output formatter will
 extract data from the piece [3] of the $$SITE^VASITE function.
  
  
 3. 104366       Problem:  MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION & INSTITUTION Files
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The station number is being incorrectly retrieved from the database in 
 certain places related to the IB MRA project. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code in $$MCR24k^IBCEU, $$CLMPRNT^IBCEMRAA and $$HDR^IBCEMRAB 
 functions to extract piece[3] of $$SITE^VASITE function.
  
  
 4. 64696        LCOB-12 Paid Units
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The FORMAT CODE (#1) field in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file for 
 IEN# 965 COB Line Paid Units data element does not round to the nearest
 integer.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify FORMAT CODE (#1) field in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file 
 for IEN# 965 COB Line Paid Units data element so that it does round to 
 the nearest integer.
  
  
 5. 92303        CBO Requested Changes to e-MRA
  
 Problem:
 --------
 PR-122 not currently in list for MRA adjustment authorized for secondary
 claim. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Add MRA adjustment PR-122 (psych, reduction) to the existing adjustment 
 category group code - "PR" in routine OKCOMBO^IBCEMQC. 
  
  
 6. 63312        Rejects from Winston-Salem Domain
  
 Problem:
 --------
 MRA Claims being rejected by Emdeon because address fields in the IB 837
 form transmission cannot contain punctuation characters.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify FORMAT CODE (#1) field of the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT(#364.7) file 
 and EXTRACT CODE (#1) field in the IB DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION (#364.5) 
 file in IENS# 5,22,55,128,146,151,358, 390,457. These output formatter
 will remove any punctuation from any city field.
  
  
 7. 105527       BCBS/Anthem Secondary Bills Done by Authorized IB
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Prevent the billing Provider ID on billing screen 3 from being deleted or
 changed when the claim is turned into an MRA secondary claim. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code in the $$PRVNUM^IBCU function so that when MRA is being 
 processed into an MRA secondary claim and the billing provider# already
 exists, then leave it alone. 
  
  
 8. 129137       Balance Due bug fix for split MRA claims
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The claim's total charges are being retrieved from the EXPALANATION OF 
 BENEFITS (#361.1) file rather than from the BILLS/CLAIMS (#399) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify code in IBCCCB routine to retrieve charges from TOTAL CHARGES 
 (#201) field in the BILLS/CLAIMS (#399) file.
