Subject: LOCKING MESSAGES/UNDEFINED VARIABLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. When actions are not allowed to be taken on a specific order in
    Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 because that order is being acted upon by
    another user, a message is sometimes displayed that does not say who
    the other user is that has that order locked. This patch will change
    the message, wherever possible, to display the name of the user that
    has that order locked. All of the places where this message is
    displayed within the Outpatient Pharmacy package could not be fixed
    with this patch, because some of the routines were already in other
    patches. The changes will be made in those other places by those other
    patches.
  
 2. When completing renewal orders entered through Computerized Patient
    Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0, there is a possibility of getting an
    undefined variable PSOX("STATUS") error. This error occurs if the
    prescription was originally entered through Outpatient Pharmacy, and
    the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) of the drug
    made it renewable, but not refillable. Then if that order is renewed
    through CPRS, the error can occur when Pharmacy finishes that order.
    This patch fixes this problem.
  
 3. Duplicate active prescriptions are being found in Outpatient Pharmacy,
    due to an order being renewed through CPRS at the same time a fill for
    that prescription is being transmitted to Consolidated Mail Outpatient
    Pharmacy (CMOP) V 2.0. A check is being added with this patch to not
    allow the renewal of an Outpatient order through CPRS if that order has
    a fill being loaded for transmission to the CMOP. The message that will
    show to the provider will be "Rx is loading into a CMOP transmission".

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
  This patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy
  users on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not
  being acted upon through CPRS.
  
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*130)
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*130
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
