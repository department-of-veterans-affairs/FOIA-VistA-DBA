Subject: UPDATE FOR REASONABLE CHARGES (2.2)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains several updates to bill processing and reports related 
 to Reasonable Charges.  No charges are updated or exported with this 
 patch.
                               
 Combine Evaluation & Management (E&M) Charges
 ---------------------------------------------
 Many E&M procedures have both an institutional and professional charge.  
 The normal billing process is to bill these two charges separately on two 
 bills.  However, some insurance companies will only pay the first charge 
 they receive for these procedures and deny the second charge as a 
 duplicate.  These are not duplicate charges.  To accommodate this issue 
 with insurance companies, functionality has been included in this patch to 
 combine both the Institutional and Professional charges for certain 
 procedures onto one bill.
          
 Use of the Combine Charges function is optional and intended for those 
 cases where combining charges is currently done manually.  Also, note that 
 charges should not be combined for MRA bills as Medicare requires the 
 Institutional and Procedure charges to be sent to Part A and Part B 
 separately.
                
 Procedures Potentially Combined:  90801-90815, 90845-90899, 99201-99215, 
 99241-99245, 99271-99288, 99385-99387, 99395-99429, 99499
                     
 When re-calculating the charges on a bill (screens 6/7 option 6), a new 
 question has been added:
                     
 'Combine Institutional and Professional Charges for E&M Procedures? NO//'
                     
 If answered Yes, then the charges for the applicable procedures will be 
 combined by adding both the facility and professional charge for the 
 procedure to one charge line item on the bill.
                     
 This function is only available if one of the above procedures is on 
 the bill and the site is Provider Based with both Facility and 
 Professional charges.
                     
 On bill's defined as either Institutional or Professional, then the 
 combined procedure charge will be added to the existing procedure charge 
 line item.  On bill's with no Charge Type defined, the combined charge 
 will be added to the first procedure charge line item.  The second 
 procedure charge line item will be deleted.
                     
                     
 Bill Procedure Modifications
 ----------------------------
 Beginning with Reasonable Charges v2.0, certain procedures must be 
 identified in a specific way on the bill for the correct charge to be 
 applied.  A function exists that will automatically apply changes to the 
 procedures when the bill is auto created or when the Bill Charge Type is 
 changed on screen 6/7 option 1.
                     
 To help ensure these changes are applied and the correct charges 
 calculated, this function will now be available after entering or editing 
 procedures.
                 
 After procedures are entered/edited on a bill (screen 4/5 option 4), a new 
 question has been added:
                     
 'Apply Procedure Updates for Charges? YES//'
                     
 If answered Yes, then the Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes will 
 be modified to correspond to the procedure's charges in the following 
 ways:
                     
 For CPT codes, whose professional charge is associated with Modifier 26:
 -  On Institutional bills, modifier 26 will be removed
 -  On Professional bills, modifier 26 will be added.
                     
 Primary Secondary Bundled procedures (EKG Split) - Procedures whose 
 component CPT codes are different from the global CPT code (primarily EKG 
 procedures):
 -  On Institutional bills, if the global code is defined in Patient Care 
    Encounter (PCE) and on the Institutional bill, then the global code is 
    replaced by the facility component codes of the procedure.
 -  On Professional bills, if the global code is defined in PCE and the 
    facility component codes are defined on the professional bill, then the 
    facility component codes will be replaced by the professional component 
    codes.
 -  On bills for Freestanding Sites, if all the component codes are defined 
    on the bill, then they will be replaced by the global code.
                     
                     
 Bill Insurance Help (?INX)
 --------------------------
 A new expanded Insurance help screen has been added to the bill.  '?INX' 
 will display all the insurance information included in '?INS' plus:
 - Plan Filing Time Frame
 - Patient Policy Last Verified Date
 - Patient Policy Comments
 - Insurance Plan Comments
                     
                     
 Revenue Code - Common Procedure Terminology (CPT) Links
 -------------------------------------------------------
 There is a function within the Charge Master that allows the linking of 
 Revenue Codes to CPT codes.  When charges are added to a bill, these links 
 are used to assign revenue codes to charges based on the procedure being 
 charged.  This list of Standard Revenue Code - CPT links has been updated 
 with this patch.
                     
 To view the list of defined Revenue Code - CPT links, use the Charge Master 
 Print [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and select V (Rev Cd Links).
                     
 Note that it is possible to set up a local list of linked Revenue Codes 
 and CPT codes if the Standard list does not contain all the links needed 
 locally.  However, a new Special Group must be used.  The STANDARD RVDC 
 LINKS group is deleted before it is updated by a national patch.  So if 
 local links are desired, then use a LOCAL RVCD LINKS Special Group.
                     
                     
 Activate Revenue Code
 ---------------------
 The Revenue Code - CPT links have been updated in this patch.  Revenue 
 code 900 has now been linked to CPT codes and will be Activated on patch 
 installation.
                     
                     
 Procedure Charge Report
 -----------------------
 A new report has been added to the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR 
 CHARGE MASTER] option, IP - Charge Items - Procedures.  This report will 
 print charges for selected procedures based on Billing Rate, Division, 
 and effective dates.
  
                     
 Auto Biller Results Report
 --------------------------
 This report contains results of the activity from the Third Party Auto 
 Biller.  The Third Party Auto Biller processes Claims Tracking entries and 
 may create a bill.  This report will provide detail for all processed 
 entries, including the bill number if a bill was created or the reason a 
 bill could not be created.
            
 This report has been updated to allow sorting and selecting by:
 -  Event Date or Auto Biller Date
 -  Type of Event: Inpatient, Outpatient or Prescription
 -  Auto Bill Created or No Bill Created
 -  Patient Name
            
 Note it is suggested that the Delete Auto Biller Results [IB CLEAN AUTO 
 BILLER LIST] be run periodically.  If the auto biller creates a bill, then 
 the entry will be removed from the auto biller results report when the 
 auto created bill is printed, transmitted, or cancelled.  However, entries 
 for Claims Tracking events for which the auto biller could not create a 
 bill are only deleted by this option and will therefore continue to 
 accumulate.  For example, if all events from a year ago have been 
 processed to completion, then enter 1 year ago in this option and any 
 entries for events older than 1 year will be removed from the report.
                     
                     
 Update Select Rate Schedules
 ----------------------------
 The Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO], Screens 6/7 
 selection 6 - Rate Schedules, has been updated.  If a site has a large 
 number of divisions with charges, the entire set of the default charge 
 sets may not be applied.  If the default selection is larger than 30, then 
 only the first 30 charge sets are used, resulting in the user being 
 required to select the individual sets to apply.  This has been updated so 
 the default will be applied regardless of the number of sets available.

   7.  REBUILD MAPPED ROUTINE(S)  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
       -------------------------
       Optional - Include the routines distributed with this patch
       in the mapped routine set.
                     
       NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or 
             if you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
                           
 8.   CLEAN UP POST INIT ROUTINE
