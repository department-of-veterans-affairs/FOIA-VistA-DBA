Subject: PATCH 1 DOCUMENTATION ERRORS

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 The purpose of this patch is twofold:
 
 1) To provide the pre-install instructions for Oncology patch ONC*2.11*1
    (ROADS UPDATE).  These instructions will provide the sites with 
    instructions on how to edit their ONCOLOGY CONTACT (#165) file for
    the conversion of pointers to it.
 
 2) To correct errors in Oncology patch ONC*2.11*1 (ROADS UPDATE) checksum
    values and explain the incorrect second line of routine ONCOTN.
 
 This patch is purely informational and does not include any routines.
 
 1) PRE-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ONCOLOGY PATCH ONC*2.11*1 (ROADS UPDATE)
  
 Oncology patch ONC*2.11*1 converts pointers that point to the ONCOLOGY
 CONTACT (#165) file to pointers to the new ACOS NUMBER (#160.19) file.  In
 order for this conversion to work properly the following must be done
 prior to running the conversion:
  
 * Each INSTITUTION contact in the ONCOLOGY CONTACT (#165) file must have
 its ACOS number placed in the COMMENTS field (#3) of the ONCOLOGY CONTACT
 (#165) file.  Please have the Oncology ADPAC enter the correct ACOS
 number for each INSTITUTION contact in the COMMENTS field (#3) in the form
 "#nnnnnn", where "nnnnnn" is the 6-digit ACOS number, (e.g. "#431910").
 Be sure to include the "#" character.
  
 * For an INSTITUTION contact in the ONCOLOGY CONTACT (#165) file that does
 NOT HAVE an assigned ACOS number, please enter a single "#" character and
 an entry will be added to the ACOS NUMBER (#160.19) file with a computed
 ACOS number.
  
 * For multiple entries of the same institution, i.e.;
                West Lake General
                Westlake General
                West-Lake General 
 enter the same ACOS number into comments field  (# 3) and the pointer to
 those three entries will be converted to a single entry in the ACOS file
 (#160.19).   The duplicates will be deleted leaving a single entry in the
 ONCOLOGY CONTACT (#165) file.  This entry can be edited if needed.
  
 When each INSTITUTION contact in the ONCOLOGY CONTACT (#165) file has
 either the ACOS number (#nnnnnn) or a single "#" entered in the COMMENTS
 field (#3),  the patch can be loaded, and the pointers will be converted.
 This conversion will also clean up any duplicate entries in the ONCOLOGY
 CONTACT (#165) file.
  
 For any contacts where the numbers were entered incorrectly or left out of
 the COMMENTS field (i.e. - a typo was entered or the field was
 inadvertently left blank), the pointers will not be converted.  A list of
 exceptions (if any) will be printed at the end of the conversion.  For
 any exceptions, enter the correct ACOS number or "#" character in the
 COMMENTS field (#3), according to above instructions, and then re-run the
 conversion by entering D ^ONCOPST1.
  
 Continue this process until there are no exceptions.
 
 2a) INCORRECT CHECKSUM VALUES
 
    The checksum values for the following routines were incorrect in patch
    ONC*2.11*1:
  
              Incorrect   Correct
    Routine   Checksum    Checksum
    -------   ---------   --------
    ONCOPST   12930577    12725761
    ONCOTN    13136858    13992916 
 
 2b) INCORRECT 2ND LINE FOR ROUTINE ONCOTN
 
    The second line of routine ONCOTN was incorrectly documented in patch
    ONC*2.11*1 as:
 
    ;;2.11;ONCOLOGY;**1,3**;Mar 07, 1995
 
    This routine contained a change that was originally scheduled for patch
    ONC*2.11*3 but was included in patch ONC*2.11*1 instead.  The reference
    to patch 3 was inadvertently left in.
 
    The change in question was to correct an AJCC staging problem for
    primaries with no AJCC staging schema.  The routine logic is correct as 
    is.  Only the second line is incorrect.
