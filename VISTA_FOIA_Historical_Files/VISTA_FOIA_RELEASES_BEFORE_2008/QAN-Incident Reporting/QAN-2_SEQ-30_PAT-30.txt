============

 At the present time, when a brief incident is created, the user is 
 requested to select a patient.  After a patient is selected, the same

 to be selected.  If the same patient is selected, the user is thrown out
 of the program and must re-enter all the data. The purpose of this patch
 is to give the user an error message and return the user to the "select
 patient" prompt when the same patient is added for a second time.
