Description:
============

 This patch corresponds to New IT Service Request #20060202.
  
 http://vista.med.va.gov/pas/ViewTrackingRecord.asp?RequestID=20060202
  
 This patch contains the following items:
  
 1) Mapping of GMR Allergies (#120.82) file entries to specific allergy-type
 Food Preferences (#115.2) file entries to allow automation of adding specific
 allergy-type Food Preferences to a patient's nutrition record when specific
 GMRA food-type Allergies are added to the patient's medical record.
  
 2) Update Nutrition reports and ordering options to display Allergy data,
 and display *ALG indication on labels for patients with allergies.
  
 3) Fix issue in which Recipes with Embedded Recipes were not being removed
 if necessary when printing tray tickets.  If the patient had an allergy or
 food preference which should exclude the recipe from the tray ticket, but
 the excluded recipe was embedded, the tray ticket code was not removing or
 replacing the food item.
  
 4) Expansion of the Clinician field in the Nutrition Location (#119.6) file
 to a multiple to allow diet, tube feeding and consult bulletins to go to
 multiple RD's rather than one single individual.
  
 5) Update and expand the Nutrition Assessment option by allowing the 
 editing of the Work in Progress assessment and adding necessary fields
 and new calculations.
  
 6) Display Body Mass Index (BMI) on Nutrition Profile and Screening Report.
  
 7) Make the inpatient Nutrition Assessment available as a Progress Note to
 TIU.  When a Nutrition Assessment is marked as 'Complete' the Assessment
 will be created as a Progress Note in TIU.
  
 8) Add the Patient Allergies, Nutrition Assessment Patient Follow-up 
 Date and Comments fields to the API provided to Health Summary.  This is for
 inpatients only.  The new fields will be viewable in the Health Summary with
 patch GMTS*2.7*83; this patch only passes the new fields to Health Summary.
  
 9) Add new alerts for Nutrition Assessment Follow-up Date and Food/Drug 
 Classification.
  
 10) Users can now control how far the Dietetics Encounter will be 
 displayed in Print Screening Report [FHASXR] and Print Nutrition Profile 
 [FHASP1] reports.

 Installation instructions:
 ==========================
      
 This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:   
    
 1) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu, select
    the 'Installation' menu.
     
 2) Use the 'Load a Distribution' option.  When prompted for a Host File, 
    enter the host file named FH5_5_P8.KID.  You may need to indicate
    the full path to the directory containing this file.
         
 3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
    option 'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and enter 'FH*5.5*8' when
    prompted for INSTALL NAME.  Verify that all routines have the correct
    checksum values. 
        
 4) Under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 'Install Package(s)'.
    Select the package 'FH*5.5*8' when prompted for the INSTALL NAME and
    proceed with the install.
    
 5) Users may remain on the system.  Since new options are introduced with
    this patch and therefore, menu rebuilding is suggested, this patch should
    be installed after hours or during non-peak times to lessen impact to
    users.  Install should take less than two minutes.  The routines included
    in this patch should be installed in the production UCI.
    
 6) The DIETETICS options do not need to be disabled during the
    installation of this patch.  Your EVS representative will answer any
    questions regarding this patch.
    
 7) Recommended responses to the following installation questions:
     
    Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO// YES
    
    Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO// NO
    Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO// NO
