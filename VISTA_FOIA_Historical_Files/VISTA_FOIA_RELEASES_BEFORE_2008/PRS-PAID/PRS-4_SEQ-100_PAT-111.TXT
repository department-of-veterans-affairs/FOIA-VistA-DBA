Subject: PHYSICIAN & DENTIST PAY CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Public Law 108-445 modified the pay policies for VHA Physicians and 
 Dentists effective January 8, 2006. This project will modify VistA 
 PAID/ETA in accordance with the new pay policies for leave accrual and 
 charging of leave.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 Physician and Dentist Pay Changes (#20051006)
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 There are no Remedy tickets associated with this patch.
  
  
 Description of Changes
 ----------------------
  
 1. The software estimates the projected leave balance when an employee
    enters or edits a request for annual or sick leave. A warning is
    displayed if the projected balance is negative. The software also
    displays the estimated earnings and projected balance when a request
    for annual or sick leave is reviewed by the supervisor for approval.
  
    This patch updates the accrual rates (days of leave earned per pay
    period) that the software uses when estimating earnings for leave
    groups 4 and 5 as follows:
  
    Leave Group   Leave Type   Pay Periods   Old Value   New Value
                               in year       days/PP     days/PP
    -----------   ----------   ------------  ---------   ---------
    4             Annual       26            1.154       1
    4             Annual       27            1.111       0.963
    4 and 5       Sick         26            0.577       0.5
    4 and 5       Sick         27            0.556       0.481
  
  
 2. This patch modifies the timekeeper time card posting options to prevent
    ML (military leave) from being posted to a day with a tour equal to DAY
    OFF for all employees. The following options can be used by the 
    timekeeper to post leave on a time card:
  
      Post Employee Time [PRSA TK POST]
      Post PT Physician Time [PRSP TK POST]
      Posting/Tour Change [PRSA TP POST] 
  
  
 3. The software automatically charges leave or non-pay to a DAY OFF for an
    employee on a daily tour when either of the following conditions is
    true:
  
      a. The DAY OFF is encapsulated by leave or non-pay.
      b. The employee did not perform duty during the week. 
  
    This patch modifies the conditions under which the software will
    automatically charge leave. Most types of leave will no longer be
    automatically charged to an administrative non-duty day (day off) by
    the software. Once the patch is installed, the software will only 
    automatically charge leave under the following conditions:
  
    Encapsulation:  If an unposted day off or a work day posted with 
    holiday excused is encapsulated by WP (leave without pay) or NP (non
    pay) then the encapsulated day will be automatically charged to WP or
    NP.
    
    No Duty Performed During the Week: If all scheduled work days in a week
    are posted with some combination of WP, NP, and HX (holiday excused)
    and at least one day is posted with WP and none of the days off are
    posted with CP, the work days posted with HX and the unposted days off
    will be automatically charged to WP.
                                        
 4. When a time card is certified using the Pay Period Certification
    [PRSA SUP REV] option, the software currently updates the time card
    posting for days that are automatically charged due to encapsulation.  
  
    This patch modifies the software so the time card will also be updated
    when days are automatically charged due to no duty performed during the
    week. Additionally, if the Return Record to Timekeeper [PRSA PR] 
    option is used to return a time card, any auto-posted data on the card 
    will be backed out.
