Description: 
============

 This patch will resolve the following problems:
 ===============================================================================
  1) NOIS WAS-0896-21365  SUS...RA   No report print
 
     SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...             [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]
       RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (RAD)]
 
     This option will now print a report similar to the "Print Casefinding-Lab
     Report" [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND LAB-RPT] detailing which new cases were
     added to suspense.
 
 ===============================================================================
  2) NOIS WAS-0297-20711  FOL...SR...broke!
 
     FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...                 [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
       SR Follow-up Status Report by Patient (132c) [ONCO FOLLOWUP-STATUS REPORT]
      
     This report was erroneously including patients whose STATUS (160,15) 
     was "Dead".  An additional sort of STATUS="Alive" has been added to the
     sort template.
 
 ===============================================================================
  3) FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT
 
     A) NOIS WAS-1095-20587  ABS...AI  DELETING TX CODE AND INFO
     
     When a treatment was deleted the other information related to that
     treatment was not being deleted.  This has been fixed.  Deleting a
     treatment will now cause all associated treatment information to be
     deleted.
 
     B) NOIS WAS-0797-20024  FIRST COURSE DATE
 
     If the physician has decided not to treat the patient there was no field
     in which to record this decision.  A new field, DATE OF NO TREATMENT
     (165.5,124), has been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file.  Entering a
     date in this field will have the following results:
 
       1) The user will receive the following prompt:
 
          "You have entered a DATE OF NO TREATMENT.  All treatment fields
          will be stuffed with the appropriate value indicating no treatment.
 
          Are you sure you want to do this? No//"
 
          Answering "Yes" will cause all treatment fields to be be stuffed with
          the "no treatment" values.
 
          Answering "No" will return you to the DATE OF NO TREATMENT prompt.  
 
       2) If the user answered "Yes" to the above question:
 
          -TREATMENT (165.5,43) will equal "NTX".
          -FIRST COURSE DATE (165.5,49) will equal the DATE OF NO TREATMENT.
          -The user will be prohibited from entering any treatment data until
           the DATE OF NO TREATMENT has been deleted.
 
       3) Deleting the DATE OF NO TREATMENT will initialize all of the
          treatment fields. 
          
     C) NEW RADIATION FIELDS
 
        The following fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5)
        file and abstract input template:
 
        442 REGIONAL DOSE:cGy               ROADS page 201  Optional Data Set
         56 NUMBER OF TREATMENTS            ROADS page 202  Optional Data Set
        125 RADIATION TREATMENT VOLUME      ROADS page 204  Optional Data Set
        126 LOCATION OF RADIATION           ROADS page 210  Optional Data Set
        127 INTENT OF TREATMENT             ROADS page 212  Optional Data Set
        128 RADIATION COMPLETION STATUS     ROADS page 220  Optional Data Set
        132 RADIATION LOCAL CONTROL STATUS  ROADS page 222  Optional Data Set
 
        NOTE: The user will only be prompted for these fields for primaries
              whose DATE DX (165.5,3) is 1/1/97 or later.
 
     D) PROTOCOL FIELDS
 
        The following fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5)
        file and abstract input template:
 
        346 PROTOCOL ELIGIBILITY STATUS   ROADS page 250 Supplementary Data Set
        133 YEAR PUT ON PROTOCOL          non-ROADS field
        560 PROTOCOL PARTICIPATION        ROADS page 251 Supplementary Data Set
 
     E) FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT DISPLAY CHANGES
 
        In addition to the above changes the "First Course of Treatment" 
        portion of the abstract has been redesigned for greater clarity.
 
 ===============================================================================
  4) NOIS WAS-0797-20122  SCREENING DATE
     NOIS WAS-0797-20263  SCREENING DATE
     INPATIENT/OUTPATIENT STATUS
 
     a) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]
            2.  Cancer Identification
 
     The cross-field edit check between SCREENING DATE (165.5,79) and DATE DX
     (165.5,3) has been removed.
 
     SCREENING DATE will now accept the following values: 00000000, 00/00/00,
     00/00/0000, 99999999, 99/99/99 and 99/99/9999.
 
     If SCREENING RESULT (165.5,119) is 8 (NA), SCREENING DATE will be stuffed
     with 00/00/00.  For this reason the SCREENING RESULT prompt has been moved 
     ahead of the SCREENING DATE prompt.  
 
     b) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...     [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c)  [ONCO ABSTRACT-EXTENDED 80]
  
        ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...     [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          PA Print Complete Abstract (132c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/EO132]
  
     SCREENING DATE and SCREENING RESULT were added to the "Print Abstract-
     Extended (80c)" and "Print Complete Abstract (132c)" reports.
  
     c) INPATIENT/OUTPATIENT STATUS (165.5,123) has been added to the abstract 
        input template and the "Print Abstract-Extended (80c)" and "Print
        Complete Abstract (132c)" reports.
 
 ===============================================================================
  5) NOIS WAS-0797-20265  ASSOCIATED WITH AIDS
 
     The field name ASSOCIATED HTLV-4 (AIDS) (165.5,41) has been changed to 
     ASSOCIATED WITH HIV.  The print template has also been modified to reflect 
     this change. 
 
 ===============================================================================
  6) NOIS WAS-0797-21279  LYMPHOMA PCE
 
     Patient Care Evaluation Study of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
     Table I - General Information
     Item 12. Personal History of Any Cancer
 
     The values for "1ST PRIMARY SITE", "1ST PRIMARY HISTOLOGY", "2ND PRIMARY
     SITE" and "2ND PRIMARY HISTOLOGY" were being computed from existing 
     primaries in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (165.5) and were uneditable.
     These fields are now editable.  Default values from existing primaries
     will be provided.
 
 ===============================================================================
  7) DATE LAST CONTACT (165.5,200)
 
     DATE LAST CONTACT was not displaying correctly on the "Print Complete
     Abstract (132c)" [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/EO132] report.  This has been fixed.
    
 ===============================================================================
  8) Survival Reports
     NOIS LIT-0797-71643  Report Only Prints to Screen
 
     STA *..Statistical Reports ... [ONCO STAT MENU]
       SP Survival by Site          [ONCO STAT-SURVIVAL SITE]
       SS Survival by Stage         [ONCO STAT-SURVIVAL STAGE]
       TX Survival by Treatment     [ONCO STAT-SURVIVAL TX]
 
     These options were displaying two DEVICE prompts.  The first DEVICE 
     prompt has been removed.  Queueing of the "Survival" reports was also not
     working properly.  This has been fixed.
 
     The "Cases dropped" portion of the reports has been enhanced to display
     the patient id, the patient name and the reason for being dropped.
 
     The "Survival by Treatment" report has been enhanced to include 
     "Immunotherapy", "Other treatment", "Combination treatment" and "No
     treatment".
 
 ===============================================================================
  9) DATE OF BIRTH
 
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...    [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
       EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-EXTENDED 80]
 
     DATE OF BIRTH (160,3) was not displaying correctly on the "CANCER REGISTRY
     ABSTRACT" report.  This has been fixed.
 
 ===============================================================================
 10) UTL *..Utility Options ...    [ONCO UTIL MENU]
       RS Registry Summary Reports [ONCO UTIL-SUMMARY REPORT]
 
     The "Registry Summary Reports" option was incorrectly counting incomplete
     primaries as Stage 0.  This has been fixed.  A new column called "INC"
     has been added to the report.
     
 ===============================================================================
 11) BRAIN CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY CODE OF 15
 
     The list of CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY (165.5,58.2) codes for BRAIN was
     incorrectly including "15 Confined to brain/meninges, NOS".  This code
     has been deleted from the list.
 
 ===============================================================================
 12) INCORRECT ICDO MORPHOLOGY (164.1) ENTRIES
 
     a) The following ICDO MORHPHOLOGY entries were named incorrectly.  The
        names have been modified as follows:
 
     Code    Old name             New name
     ------  ------------------   -----------------------------------
     9710/2  MICROGLIOMA IN SITU  MARGINAL ZONE LYMPHOMA, NOS IN SITU
     9710/3  MICROGLIOMA          MARGINAL ZONE LYMPHOMA, NOS
 
     b) The following ICDO MORPHOLOGY entry had an incorrect CODE:
 
                                 Old code   New code
                                 --------   --------
        JUVENILE GRANULOSA CELL  8621/1     8622/1
 
 ===============================================================================
 13) CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (165.5,38)
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP (165.5,88)
 
     There was a potential problem when entering CLINICAL STAGE GROUP and
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP values.  If the user entered the Roman numeral
     form of the stage group value (e.g. IIIA) instead of the Arabic numeral
     form (e.g. 3A), the Roman numeral form was being stored which caused a
     problem with the "Registry Summary Reports" [ONCO UTIL-SUMMARY REPORT]. 
     This has been fixed.
 
 ===============================================================================
 14) The following unused fields have been  deleted from the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY
     (165.5) file:
 
     #56    HYPERTHERMIA THERAPY DATE
     #56.1  HYPERTHERMIA HOSPITAL
     #56.2  HYPERTHERMIA THERAPY
 
 ===============================================================================
 15) SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY (164.2) errors
 
     a) PALATE, UVULA (C05.2) was incorrectly included in the TOPOGRAPHY (10)
     subfile of the ORAL CAVITY entry of the SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY file.
     It was removed from this entry and added to the PHARYNX entry.
 
     b) The following topographies were missing from the TOPOGRAPHY (10)
     subfile of the SOFT TISSUE entry of the SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY file:
  
     C38.1  MEDIASTINUM, ANTERIOR
     C38.2  MEDIASTINUM, POSTERIOR
     C38.3  MEDIASTINUM, NOS
     C38.8  HEART/MEDIAS/PLEURA, OVERLAP
     C48.0  RETROPERITONEUM
     C48.1  PERITONEUM, SPECIFIED
     C48.2  PERITONEUM NOS
     C48.8  RETROPERITONEUM OVERLAP
 
     They have been added.
 
     c) The following topographies were incorrectly included in the TOPOGRAPHY
     (10) subfile of the OTHER/MISCELLANEOUS entry of the SITE-GROUP FOR
      ONCOLOGY file.
 
     C38.1  MEDIASTINUM, ANTERIOR
     C38.2  MEDIASTINUM, POSTERIOR
     C38.3  MEDIASTINUM, NOS
     C38.8  HEART/MEDIAS/PLEURA, OVERLAP
 
     They have been removed.
 
 ===============================================================================
 16) FOLLOWING REGISTRY
 
     The following new field has been added to the FOLLOW-UP (160,400)
     sub-file of the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (160) file:
 
     10  FOLLOWING REGISTRY              ROADS page 267  Optional Data Set
 
 ===============================================================================
 17) ICD0-TOPOGRAPHY LIST (160,49)
 
     The computed field, ICD0-TOPOGRAPHY LIST, has been modified to eliminate
     the display of the topography "C" codes.
 
 ===============================================================================
 18) RE-DESIGN OF PRINT COMPLETE ABSTRACT OPTION
 
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...      [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
       PA  Print Complete Abstract (132c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/EO132]
 
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...      [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
       MA  Print QA/Multiple Abstracts    [ONCO ABSTRACT-MULTIPLE]
         3  Complete Abstract 132c/QA
 
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...      [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
       MA  Print QA/Multiple Abstracts    [ONCO ABSTRACT-MULTIPLE]
         5  Print PCE Data
 
     The Print Complete Abstract (132c) option has been re-designed so that
     the layout of the fields displayed is more logical, neater and easier to
     read.  Also, the patient's name and SSN will now appear at the top of
     each new page of the printed abstract.  New fields that have been added
     to the abstract in this patch have also been added to this option to
     appear on the printed abstract.
 
     The new printed abstract is accessed when printing single abstracts
     (ABS...PA), when printing multiple abstracts (ABS...MA...3) or when
     printing PCE data for a specific site with attached abstracts
     (ABS...MA...5).
 ===============================================================================
 19) COMPUTED STAGE GROUP ERROR
 
     For Bladder and Prostate primaries, if the N code had a value of "88"
     (NA), the STAGE GROUP value was being incorrectly computed as "IV".
     The correct value is "99".  This has been fixed.                        
     
 ===============================================================================
 The following NOIS calls have been resolved by this patch:
