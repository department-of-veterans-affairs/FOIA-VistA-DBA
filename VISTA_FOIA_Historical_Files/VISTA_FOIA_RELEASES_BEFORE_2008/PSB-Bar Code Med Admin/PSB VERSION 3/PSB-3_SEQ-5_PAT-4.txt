 1.  Enhancement:  Read Only Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA).
     This patch deploys the BCMA-HSC project "Read Only BCMA"
     functionality.  After the installation of this build (PSB*3.0*4)
     and installation of the released Read Only BCMA GUI executable
     file, users allocated the "PSB READ ONLY" security key will be
     granted documented Read Only BCMA functionality.  Read Only BCMA
     functionality is documented in the BCMA V. 3.0 GUI User Manual.
     Also, as documented, users allocated the "PSB STUDENT" security
     key using BCMA while no BCMA instructor is using BCMA, will be
     granted Read Only BCMA functionality until a BCMA Instructor has
     concurrently accessed BCMA.
  
  
 2.  Enhancement:  Patient Record Flag Reporting.
     This patch provides "Patient Record Flag" reporting functionality.
     During patient selection, information about any active Patient
     Record Flag(s) associated with the selected patient will be
     presented to the user.  This patch also give the user the ability
     to display and print details of all active Patient Record Flags.
     This patch will also display a "FLAG" button via the patient's GUI
     Virtual Due List.  This "FLAG" button gives the user access to a
     report of the all the active Patient Record Flags associated with
     the patient.
  
  
 3.  Enhancement:  "Provider Hold" Order Edit Notification.
     After the installation of PSB*3.0*4 GUI, the user will be notified
     when the user is about to edit an administration associated with an 
     order having the status of "Provider Hold", at the time of edit.
     The displayed message will be "The order associated with this
     administration is currently on PROVIDER HOLD."
