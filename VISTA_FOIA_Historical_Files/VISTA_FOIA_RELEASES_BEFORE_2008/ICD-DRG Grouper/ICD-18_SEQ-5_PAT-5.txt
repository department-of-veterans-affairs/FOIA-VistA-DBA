Description: 
============

    This patch provides the annual update to the DRG Grouper v20.0.  It is 
 the second phase of the 2003 ICD/DRG Update and is the follow up to patch 
 ICD*18*4.
  
    There will be no new version package release.  All necessary changes 
 are covered by this patch.
  
    No code files are included in the patch, as all changes are handled 
 programmatically through the pre-init routine.
  
    The changes were published in the Federal Register, Vol.67, No.148, 
 dated August 1, 2002, with the effective date of October 1, 2002.  DRG 
 Reclassification changes are in pp.49985-50008.
  
    Changes include:
  
 I.    New/revised DRG codes (file #80.2).
 II.   DRG Reclassification changes to the Grouper.
 III.  Miscellaneous modifications to the Grouper, discovered in the
       course of internal testing.
 IV.   New DRG Weights & Trims.
  
    A summary of the additions/changes made follows:

 IV.  New DRG Weights & Trims.
       New weight, high trim and ALOS values for each DRG have been added
       to the DRG file #80.2 for the 2003 Fiscal Year.  These values were
       obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
       More specifically, this FY 2003 update revises these fields for each
       DRG:
          Relative Weight 
          ALOS (average length of stay)
          Low & High trim
  
       Trim values, sent this year by CMS with a .0 value, have been
       "seeded" with last year's trim value.
  
       The new values will be used for all discharges since October 1, 2002
       and can be seen when DRG reports are obtained for such cases, or
       when current DRG calculations are made using the following options:
          ICD DRG GROUPER (DRG Grouper)
          DG DRG CALCULATION (DRG Calculation)
          DG PTF DRG INFORMATION (DRG Information Report)

 =======================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  However, it would be
 preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
  
 If installed during the normal workday it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
     ICD DRG GROUPER          DRG Grouper
     DG DRG CALCULATION       DRG Calculation
     DG PTF DRG INFORMATION   DRG Information Report
  
 Install Time - 5 to 10 minutes.
  
 Please ensure that your programming variables are set, 
 including your DUZ(0)="@", otherwise installation will abort.
  
 This patch does not involve global file restoration. Nonetheless, we
 suggest you create global saves on files #80 (^ICD9), #80.1 (^ICD0) and
 #80.2 (^ICD) in the event problems develop during the install.  If it
 became necessary to use the saved files, you should first kill all the
 records (except the zero node) before applying the global restores.
  
 1.   LOAD TRANSPORT GLOBAL 
      ---------------------
      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 2.   DISABLE ROUTINE MAPPING   (DSM for Open VMS sites only) 
      -----------------------
      Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in 
      step 3 below.  
       
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in 
      your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
 3.   COMPONENTS SENT WITH PATCH
