Description:

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1.  POR-1003-51637     The ECQ extract not pulling correct provider fr. 
                        A&SP
    Problem:
    -------
    The QUASAR Extract [ECXQSR] is incorrectly pulling invalid 
    providers number from the QUASAR A&SP Visit File. The extract
    is pulling the A&SP provider without using the A&SP provider
    pointer logic resulting in an invalid NEW PERSON file lookup.
  
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    This patch modifies the QUASAR Extract to correctly pull the 
    provider by using the A&SP Provider pointer logic which points 
    to the correct NEW PERSON entry.
  
    Both the .DOC and the .PDF versions of the FY 2004 Data 
    Definitions Guide and Extract File Formats VDL document have 
    been updated to show that the data is derived from the  
    correct source.
