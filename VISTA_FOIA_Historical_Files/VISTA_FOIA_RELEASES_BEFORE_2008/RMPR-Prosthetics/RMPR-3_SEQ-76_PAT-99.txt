 Patch Brief Description:
 ------------------------
 
 This software enhancement was developed in response to the issue paper, 
 titled "Prosthetic NIF Stakeholder Workgroup Findings", 4/21/04.
 
 The workgroup decided to adopt a phased approach to the issues: 1) develop a 
 short term solution to fix the data that will be altered in the future as a 
 result of IFCAP Patch 63 (PRC*5.1*63); and 2) develop a long-term solution 
 that would best resolve the issues raised by Prosthetics to ensure quality 
 data was being captured and successful NIF implementation.
 
 With this prosthetics patch, the Prosthetic Patient Treatment Record (2319)
 has been modified to display the Prosthetics HCPCS Short Description
 (File #661.1, Field #.02), instead of the IFCAP Short Description.
 
 With IFCAP patch 63 (PRC*5.1*63) the interface from the contractor-provided
 VA National Item File (NIF) database will overwrite the IFCAP Short Description
 (File #441, Field #.05).  The national short description in NIF will replace
 the existing short description field (File #441, field #.05).
 
 Prosthetics patch RMPR*3*99 was developed as phase one to remove the IFCAP 
 Item Short Description from providing the basic item information on the 2319, 
 and to use the Prosthetic HCPCS Short Description as a replacement.
