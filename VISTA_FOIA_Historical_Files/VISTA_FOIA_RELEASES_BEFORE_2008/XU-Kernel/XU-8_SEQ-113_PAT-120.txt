============

  
  ISF-0699-00000 XTER1A   The fix to XTER1A for working with Mailman patch
  TAM-0899-30289          XM*7.1*50 broke printing.  Fixed.
  
  MON-0599-52241 XUTMRP   Under some conditions the Taskman Repoint Waiting
  TAM-0499-30489 XUTMRP1  Task would error out. Also some of the prompts were
  MON-0599-52241          not meaningful, Fixed.
                 
  HARDHATS       XUTMDEVQ A request to be able to return ZTSK. Added a 5th
                          parameter to stop the newing of ZTSK.
                          If the 5th parameter is missing or 0 then it will
                          work as before, a 1 will prevent ZTSK from being newed.
                          
                          
  FAV-0499-70417 ZTEDIT*  If the user has the screenman editor as default then
                          they get a UNDEF error.  Fixed.
                          
  WPB-0599-32576          The New Person file doesn't have a New User Bulletin.
  STX-0599-72647          Added it back in.
  
                 XLFSTR   Updated function call 
                          $$TRIM^XLFSTR(x[,"[L][R]"][,char]).
                          This call will trim spaces or other char from the left,
                          right or both sides of a input string.
                          W "["_$$TRIM^XLFSTR("  A B C  ")_"]" => [A B C]
                          W "["_$$TRIM^XLFSTR("//A B C//",,"/")_"]" => [A B C]
                          
  ISL-0699-51707 XLFDT    The FMADD call would return 141301 if passed (0,0)
                          This has been fixed.
                          
  Y2K testing    XLFDT3   The SCH^XLFDT didn't handle Feb 29, 2000.

  List of preceding patches: 16, 71, 86, 112
  Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.
  
  ==============================================================================
  Installation:
  
  
    1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
        
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
        
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
           
   4.  This patch can be loaded any non-peak time.
       Users can remain on the system. 
        
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
           Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*120'
                                ==========
                                
          No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                          ==
        
    8.  After installing this patch,
        OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
        DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
        your production account to each manager account:
        
  ZTEDIT*
  
        
    9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
        All sites:
        DO ^ZTEDIT
         
   10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
