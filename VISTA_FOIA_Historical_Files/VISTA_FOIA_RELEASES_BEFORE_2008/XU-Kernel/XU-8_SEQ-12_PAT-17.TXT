Subject: KIDS allows install when it shouldn't

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  Patch XU*8*17 corrects a problem that was identified by Hines
  Software Development.  The variable XPDQUIT was not preventing
  the install from continuing when set to 2 in the environment check
  routine, as documented in the manual.
   
  This patch can be installed while users are on the system without damage
  to any files. No users should be using the KIDS software while installing 
  this patch.
   
  ====================================================================== 
   
  INSTALLATION: 
    1.  This routine is usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
    3.  Answer NO to the question: 
        'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?' 
    4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
        'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
        have the correct checksums.
    6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
        'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XU*8.0*17' and proceed
        with install.
    7.  If you are a MSM site move the routine to the other servers.
    8.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
