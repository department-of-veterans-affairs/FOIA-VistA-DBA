Subject: Add global return to GETLST~XPAR

Category:

Description:
============

 Patch Tracking #: 36961791
 Test Sites: OI-Salt Lake
 Blood Bank Clearance: 9/25/2003
 
 NOIS: ISA-0803-10036
 Request from CPRS developer to have the GETLST API have an option to put its
 output in a global like the change that was done to ENVAL.
 Fix: An additional parameter was added to the call.  The new parameter, if 
 defined changes the first parameter from a return array to a closed global 
 root to accept the data.
 
 Please see Parameter Tools Patch XT*7.3*26, Supplement to Patch Description 
 at http://www.va.gov/vdl/Infrastructure.asp?appID=12 for details.
 
 
 GETLST(LIST,ENT,PAR,FMT,ERR,GBL) ; return all parameter instances for an entity
         ; .LIST: array in which instances are returned
         ;   FMT: format of returned data, defaults to "Q" (internal values)
         ;        "I" - internal  instance)=internal value
         ;        "Q" - quick,    #)=internal instance^internal value
         ;        "E" - external, #)=external instance^external value
         ;        "B" - both,     #,"N")=internal instance^external instance
         ;                        #,"V")=internal value^external value
         ;        "N" - external instance)=internal value^external value
         ;   GBL: Optional, Set to 1 if LIST holds a Closed Global root

 =========================================================================
 Installation:
 
 >>>Do not allow users to log in to the system during installation.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
 >>>If you accept a slight risk of jobs getting a CLOBER/EDITED errors
 >>>users and TaskMan may remain running.  Otherwise stop all other
 >>>jobs on the system.
 
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you may need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
 
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
 
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
 
   4.  Because this routine is used by CPRS to get parameters.
       Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
       users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER/NOSOURCE
       errors is acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
   
 
   5.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XT*7.3*79'
                              =========
                              
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// YES
 
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
 
   6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
