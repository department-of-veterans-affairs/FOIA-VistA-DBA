 If a "?" is entered at the Enter Nursing Home Rate: prompt while using 
 the Update Vendor Contract/Rates - CNH [FBCNH UPDATE VENDOR CONTRACT]
 option, an undefined error for variable DIR(0) may occur or DIR gets lost
 and displays the rates without accepting new ones.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. ISW-0903-21845     Undef DIR(0) Update Vendor Contract Rates
        
    Problem:
    -------
    When the user is entering nursing home rates using the Update Vendor 
    Contract/Rates - CNH [FBCNH UPDATE VENDOR CONTRACT] option, if no 
    rates exist and the user enters a "?" at the "Enter Nursing Home 
    Rate:" prompt, then when prompted again enters a rate amount, and 
    on the next prompt enters "?", a numbered display of the rate 
    followed by a select number prompt is displayed instead of the  
    desired "Enter Nursing Home Rate:" prompt.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------
    When the user is entering nursing home rates using the Update Vendor 
    Contract/Rates - CNH [FBCNH UPDATE VENDOR CONTRACT] option the process 
    sets up ^DIR to call the subroutine DISPLAY^FBAAVD1 to display the 
    existing rates. This process uses the FBRATE flag as a switch
    to enter ^DIR or not. When the 1st rate is added, followed by 
    another "?" at the next "Enter Nursing Home Rate:" prompt, the flag 
    FBRATE is on and DISPLAY^FBAAVD1 makes a second unwanted call to ^DIR.
  
    The routine FBAAVD2 has been updated to kill the FBRATE flag before
    calling DISPLAY^FBAAVD1 so ^DIR is not mistakenly called the second 
    time.
