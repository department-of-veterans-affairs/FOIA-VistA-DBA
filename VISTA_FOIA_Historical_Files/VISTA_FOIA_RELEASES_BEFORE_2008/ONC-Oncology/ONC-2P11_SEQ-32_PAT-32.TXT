Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is available via FTP in a KIDS distribution file.  The Host
 File is named ONC211P32.KID and is located in the [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]
 directory of the following OI Field Offices.
     
  OIFO     FTP ADDRESS
  ----     -----------

  Hines    ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  SLC      ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
    
   
 This patch does not contain any data dictionary changes/additions.
   
 This patch will resolve the following problems:
   
  1) NOIS HOU-1201-71928 NAKED REFERENCE CLEARED UPON RTN FROM SUBROUTINE
   
     Lab casefinding occasionally returns a 6-digit or "malignant, 
     metastatic" (Behavior Code = 6) morphology code.  (e.g. 8140/6 and
     8070/32)  These codes are not used by VISTA cancer registries.  These
     inappropriate codes were being "stuffed" into the HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3)
     (165.5,22.3) field and causing an "undefined variable ^(0)" error for
     lung and leukemia cases.
 
     This has been fixed.  When these codes are found an attempt will be made
     to convert them to usable cancer registry morphology codes prior to
     "stuffing".  (e.g. 8140/6 will be converted to 8140/3.  8070/32 will be
     converted to 8070/3.)
 
  2) EXTENSION (165.5,30)
   
     Phoenix reported a problem with the EXTENSION field.  When attempting to
     enter an EXTENSION code for a particular primary, the application would
     display the error message "Histology code is required!" and prohibit the
     user from entering an EXTENSION code.
   
     This problem was due to an ambiguous DATE DX value of "01/99/2001" (JAN
     2001).  This ambiguous date was confusing the program logic which 
     determines whether a primary is an ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 case.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  3) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing
       MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts
         5 Print PCE Data
           11 Intracranial
   
     When printing the Intracranial PCE, the application would abort with a
     "Null subscript" error if there was no SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT   
     data for the primary being printed.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  4) SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE (165.5,58.2) code 50
     SKIN (C44.0-C44.9)
   
     The description of SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE code 50 for SKIN 
     (C44.0-C44.9) has been changed:
   
     Old value: 50 Radical excision of a lesion, NOS
   
     New value: 50 Radical excision of a lesion, 1 cm or more, NOS
   
  5) DX/STAGING/PALLIATIVE PROC     (165.5,58.1)
     DX/STGING/PALLIATIVE PROC DATE (165.5,58.3)
   
     When displaying DX/STGING/PALLIATIVE PROC DATE and DX/STAGING/PALLIATIVE
     PROC values, the values were being concatinated together with no
     intervening space.
   
     Before: 10/16/0102 Incisional, needle, or aspiration biopsy of primary
                        site
   
     After:  10/16/01 02 Incisional, needle, or aspiration biopsy of primary 
                         site
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  6) PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION (165.5,30.1)
   
     For non-prostate cases PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION was being stuffed with 99
     (No prostatectomy done within first course of treatment).  This was
     incorrect.  PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION is for prostate cases only.  It should
     be left blank for all other cases.
   
  7) STATE AT DX (165.5,16)
   
     The STATE AT DX values for codes XX, YY and ZZ were modifed to coincide
     with NAACCR Record Layout Version 9,1.
   
     Old values: XX = US, NOS/Canada, NOS/Oth Cntry Known
                 YY = Country Unknown, Not US, Not Canada
                 ZZ = Unknown
   
     New values: XX = Known foreign country (not Canada)
                 YY = Unknown foreign country
                 ZZ = US, NOS; Canada, NOS; Unknown
   
  8) TNM Path T   [880] 422-423
     TNM Clin T   [950] 432-433
     TNM Other T [1000] 442-443
     CERVIX UTERI (C53.0-C53.9)
   
     The following TNM T codes for CERVIX UTERI sites were not being 
     downloaded correctly.
   
     T CODE  INCORRECT DOWNLOAD VALUE   CORRECT DOWNLOAD VALUE
     ------  ------------------------   ----------------------
     T1A1    1A                         A1
     T1A2    1A                         A2
     T1B1    1B                         B1
     T1B2    1B                         B2
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  9) FOLLOW-UP FORM LETTER (165.1)
     RACE 1                (160,8)
     ICD-O TOPOGRAPHY LIST (160,49)
 
     Due to the recent change of two ONCOLOGY PATIENT (160) field names the
     following FOLLOW-UP FORM LETTER entries contained incorrect field
     names:
 
     DEATH INQUIRY DOT MATRIX   
     DEATH INQUIRY LASER PRINTER   
  
     INSTITUTION DOT MATRIX   
     INSTITUTION LASER PRINTER   
 
     PHYSICIAN DOT MATRIX   
     PHYSICIAN LASER PRINTER   
 
     TUMOR REGISTRAR DOT MATRIX   
     TUMOR REGISTRAR LASER PRINTER   
           
     The ONCOLOGY PATIENT fields in question are RACE 1 (formerly RACE) and
     ICD-O TOPOGRAPHY LIST (formerly ICD0-TOPOGRAPY LIST).
  
     These letters have been fixed.
 
 10) FIN Coding System       [35]   11-11
     ICD-O-3 Conversion Flag [2116] 1020-1020
 
     The NAACCR download logic has been modified as follows:
 
     a) If DATE DX is 1999 or earlier
          FIN Coding System = 1 COC 6-digit codes (used by COC until 1999)
 
        If DATE DX is 2000 or later
          FIN Coding System = 2 COC FIN 10-digit codes (used 1999+)
 
     b) If DATE DX is 2001 or later
          ICD-O-3 Conversion Flag = 0 Morphology (Morph--Type&Behav ICD-O-3, 
                                    item 521) originally coded in ICD-O-3
 
        If DATE DX is 2000 or earlier
          ICD-O-3 Conversion Flag = 1 Morphology (Morph--Type&Behav ICD-O-3, 
                                    item 521) converted from (Morph--Type&Behav
                                    ICD-O-2, item 419) without review
 
 11) RACE 2 (160,8.1) 
     RACE 3 (160,8.2) 
     RACE 4 (160,8.3) 
     RACE 5 (160,8.4) 
 
     In accordance with the following ROADS standard a default of "NA" (88) 
     has been added to the RACE 2-RACE 5 prompts. 
 
     ROADS page 74:
     "If only one race is reported for the person, use code 88 for the 
     remaining race fields (Race 2-Race 5)."
