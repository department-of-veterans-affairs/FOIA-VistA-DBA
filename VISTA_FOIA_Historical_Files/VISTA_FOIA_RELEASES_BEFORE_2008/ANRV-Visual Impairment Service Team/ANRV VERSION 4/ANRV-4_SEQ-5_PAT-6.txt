 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HOU-0703-70203  Inconsistent Data Entry
  
 Problem:
 --------
 At the screen titled, "Orientation & Mobility Completion Screen", the 
 default choice is "Go forward to the electronic signature page to save
 the review on to VistA". Clicking on the "Next" button takes the 
 application back to the beginning of the section instead of the 
 electronic signature page.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code for the click event for the Next button on this screen was 
 found to be wrong.  The code has been changed and the Next button will 
 now operate on this screen as it does for similar screens from the other 
 sections of the review.
