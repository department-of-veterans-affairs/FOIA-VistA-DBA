Subject: DELETE OBSOLETE PACKAGE (UTILIZATION)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

  This patch addresses no NOIS messages or E3Rs.  
  
  The routine in this patch (QAQDIU) will delete the PRMQ* routines,
  options, file #513.8 (UTILIZATION REVIEW package), and file 513.85
  (UTILIZATION REVIEW CONFIGURATION).  It will also delete the
  subfiles and templates associated with 513.8 and 513.85.  If any sites
  want to keep the data in these files or have use for these routines, they
  should be renamed in the site's local namespace before the installation
  of the patch. References to files 3, 6 and 16 will not be fixed, and the
  software will not be supported.
  
  Once the patch is installed, run routine ^QANDIU to delete the files,
  data and templates.  The options and routines for this package (namespace
  PRMQ*) will be AUTOMATICALLY deleted at the local site when the patch is
  installed.
  
  If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
  following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
  disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
  Other DHCP users will not be affected.
  
       [PRMQ MAIN/APPR MENU]     Utilization Review Main Menu
       [PRMQ MANAGER MENU]       Utilization Review Manager Menu
       [PRMQ USER MENU]          Utilization Review User Menu
  
    Install Time - less than 10 minutes
  
          ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
  1.  LOAD TRANSPORT GLOBAL         
      ---------------------        
      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.                   
  
  2.  DISABLE ROUTINE MAPPING   (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
      -----------------------
      Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in 
      step 3 below.
  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
            in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  ROUTINES SENT WITH PATCH
      ------------------------        
      The following is a list of the routines included in this patch. 
      The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
  
         ;;1.7;Integration Module;**[patch list]**; 07/25/1995 
  
                       CHECK^XTSUMBLD results
  
     Routine          Before Patch     After Patch   Patch List     
     -------          ------------     -----------   ----------    
     QAQDIU                N/A            81763          4            
  
       Total number of routines - 1
  
  4. This patch deletes all menu options from the old Utilization Review
 package; therefore, menu rebuilding should be done.  Kernel patch XU*8*81
 causes automatic menu rebuilding if the install is queued.  The rebuilding
 occurs immediately after the install completes.
  
 If the build is executed from the terminal, the user will receive
 a Menu Rebuild prompt and is allowed to change the default of YES to
 NO. 
  
 The time required to install this patch may be prolonged due to this
 menu rebuiding, especially if more than one patch in being loaded that
 requires menu rebuiding.
  
  
  5.   START UP KIDS         
       -------------
  
      Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]:
  
       Edits and Distribution ...               
       Utilities ...
       Installation ...         
  
    Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                             ---
      Load a Distribution         
      Print Transport Global           
      Compare Transport Global to Current System
      Verify Checksums in Transport Global          
      Install Package(s)
      Restart Install of Package(s)          
      Unload a Distribution
      Backup a Transport Global     
      Select Installation Option:
   
  
  6.   Select Installation Option:     
       --------------------------
  
       NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
               NAME, enter QAQ*1.7*4):          
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
  
  7.   Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
                                  ----------------
      **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
   
       a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
       b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
           Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer YES.
  
       c.  When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
           Order':'  Enter the following options: 
  
        [PRMQ MAIN/APPR MENU]     Utilization Review Main Menu

        [PRMQ USER MENU]          Utilization Review User Menu
  
  
  
  
 Once the patch has been installed run ^QAQDIU to delete the files,data and
 templates.
  
 ****NOTE****
 Running this routine will delete the Utilization Review files.  If your
 site feels it needs the routines or data they should either be renamed to
 a local namespace before running this routine or the routine should not be
 run.
  
 At the programmer prompt enter
  
     >D ^QAQDIU
  
 This routine can de deleted from the local system after being successfully
 run.
