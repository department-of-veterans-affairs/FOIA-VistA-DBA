Subject: ADD FIELD TRIGGERS FOR ORU~Z07s

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Issue
 -----
 As part of the Enrollment Vista Changes Enrollment Systems Redesign
 (EVC ESR) project, 106 fields from ten files were identified that would
 need to trigger an Enrollment Transmission (as part of an ORU~Z07 Full
 Data Transmission) to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC). Additionally,
 five fields from the PATIENT file (#2) were identified that already
 contained the trigger but no longer needed it and therefore should have 
 the trigger be deleted.
  
 Solution
 --------
 Each of the fields listed below in the File Summary section of this patch
 description was checked to see if either of two triggers (EVENT^IVMPLOG or
 AUTOUPD^DGENA2) was in the data dictionary for that field. If not, then a
 traditional cross-reference trigger was added. One hundred and six such
 fields were identified. 
  
 If a trigger was present on a field but not needed, it was deleted. Five
 such fields were found, and are identified in the File Summary table by
 means of a "Yes" in the "Trigger Deleted" column. The triggers are no
 longer needed on these fields because whenever they are edited, a PATIENT
 (#2) file field that contains the trigger (ADDRESS CHANGE DATE/TIME
 (#.118)) is automatically updated and the trigger fired.
  
 In addition, the data in the following 3 fields were set to be
 write-protected from being updated independently via FileMan.
  
 File #2 PATIENT
 TEMPORARY ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM (field # .12113)
 CONFIDENTIAL ADDR CHANGE DT/TM (field # .14112)
  
 File #408.31 ANNUAL MEANS TEST
 DATE/TIME TEST LAST EDITED (field # 2.02)
  
 These fields are automatically updated as a result of changes to any of
 the Temporary Address or Confidential Address fields in the PATIENT file
 (#2) or any of the fields in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (#408.31),
 respectively.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 NOTE: THIS PATCH MUST BE INSTALLED DURING OFF HOURS. Keeping system
 usage to a minimum during patch installation will prevent potential
 errors due to the large number of options that access the fields 
 whose DDs are being changed by this patch.
  
 You should also stop the HL7 filers prior to the install to prevent
 possible 'No Source Errors' from occurring. No transmissions will be 
 lost if the filers are stopped first; they will be picked up once 
 the filers are restarted.
  
 If you have set up any of the above fields for site-specific auditing, 
 the install of the patch will overwrite the audit flag. Because of this,
 the audit flag for those fields should be turned on again after the patch
 has been installed.
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes (unless otherwise indicated)
