Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH

    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
  
 This patch modifies the OP application to perform real-time electronic claim
 submission to third party payers. It will also enable OP users to see and act
 on third party payer rejects such as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and Refill
 Too Soon rejects along with their daily normal prescription processing 
 activities. The following areas of OP have been changed:
   
 1.  Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option 
  
     At the point that the prescription is verified, the New Order, Edit,
     Renew, Refill, and Pull Early from Suspense functions will begin the
     third party billing evaluations. If IB determines that the
     prescription is third party billable, a message will be displayed on
     the user's screen stating that the claim is being submitted to ECME
     and it will also show the progress of the claim. If the payer rejects
     the claim for DUR or Refill Too Soon, the payer's information will be
     displayed, and the user will be given the opportunity to either ignore
     the payer's response and move on with the filling process; override
     the reject by resubmitting the claim or postpone the processing of the
     prescription by taking no action when the reject is received. For
     prescriptions that have been electronically submitted to the third
     party payer, an indicator is displayed on the Patient Prescription
     Processing screen. This indicator will take the form of "e" next to
     the prescription number (e.g.,"2090303$e").  
   
     A new section called REFILL TOO SOON/DUR REJECTS (Third Party) has
     been created in the Medication Profile screen to single out
     prescriptions that had an electronic claim rejected by third party
     payers for REFILL TOO SOON or DUR reasons. Prescriptions under this
     section have certain restrictions. Basically, they cannot be renewed,
     refilled, reprinted, copied or released until the REJECT is resolved.
     When an individual prescription is selected, the user will have a new
     hidden option called REJ - View Reject, which will allow them to
     resolve the REJECT and remove it from the REFILL TOO SOON/DUR REJECTS
     (Third Party) section.
    
     The prescription release option was modified to perform NDC (National
     Drug Code) validation for electronically billable prescriptions. When
     the user selects a new NDC a new claim is submitted to the payer
     before the prescription is released.
    
     In the OP Medications screen, a new DAW CODE field (#81) of the 
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was created for electronically billable
     prescriptions and can be edited by selecting '21' at the 'Select
     Action' prompt. For non-electronically billable prescriptions this
     field is not displayed at all.
     
     When the electronically billable prescription is released, this option
     will allow the user to edit the NDC code for the prescription. In the
     OP Medications screen the NDC field is listed under the Drug field
     and can be edited by selecting '2' to edit the drug at the 'Select
     Action' prompt. For sites that do not allow Drug editing, the option
     '2' will allow editing of the NDC only.
  
 2.  Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option 
  
     The Return Medication to Stock function was modified to notify the
     third party payer that a previously billed prescription was not
     actually filled. If the prescription was previously billed to a third
     party payer and a payable response was received, the claim will be
     reversed, and the pharmacy user will see messaging stating that the
     third party claim was submitted for reversal. If a claim for the
     prescription was previously rejected by the third party payer, the
     user will see a message indicating that no reversal was required. If
     the prescription was not previously billed to a third party payer, no
     message regarding electronic billing will be displayed.
  
 3.  Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL] option 
  
     The message for Delete a Prescription was modified to perform in the 
     same manner as the Return Medication to Stock function described
     above.
   
 4.  Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option 
   
     The Pull Early from Suspense function was modified to submit a third 
     party claim for the prescription. A message will display to notify the
     user of the status of the claim as it is going through the submission 
     process.  
  
 5.  Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option 
  
     This option was modified to submit third party claims in the same
     manner as stated above except the Print from Suspense File function
     will be performed in the background. No user interaction will occur.
   
 6.  ePharmacy Menu [PSO EPHARMACY MENU] menu
  
     This new menu was created for electronic billing related options. It
     is being placed under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] menu. Two new
     options are being added under this new menu:
  
     6.1 Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option
  
         This option is used to process third party payer rejects that have
         clinical significance. For now, only DUR (Drug Utilization Review)
         and REFILL TOO SOON rejects are being considered as having
         clinical significance.
  
     6.2 Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS 
         VIEW/PROCESS] option
  
         This option performs the same functionality as the option above.
         However, the user has more filtering capabilities through this
         option. In addition, closed/resolved rejects can only be viewed by
         using this option.
           
 7.  Release Medication [PSO RELEASE] option 
  
     The prescription release process was modified to perform NDC (National
     Drug Code) validation for electronically billable prescriptions. When
     the user selects a new NDC, a new claim is submitted to the payer
     before the prescription is released. Besides this option, the 
     prescription can be released from the Medication Profile screen and
     from the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT] option in the Controlled
     Substances application.
    
 8.  View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option
   
     This option was changed to include two new sections: ECME Log and ECME
     REJECT Log. Information about third party payer submission and rejects
     will be displayed under these sections.
     
 9.  Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT] option
  
     The new DAW CODE field (#81) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was
     created for electronically billable prescriptions and can be edited
     through this option. For non-electronically billable prescriptions,
     the field is not displayed at all.
     
     Once an electronically billable prescription is released, this option
     will allow the user to edit the NDC code. The NDC code is displayed on
     the screen just below the Drug field, and can be edited by selecting
     field '2' to edit the Drug. For sites that do not allow Drug editing,
     the field '2' can be used to edit the NDC code only.
  
 10. The NDC field (#4) under the CMOP EVENT multiple (#52.01) of the
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52) has been renamed to NDC RECEIVED. This field
     holds the NDC that was received from the CMOP facility with the
     dispensing message. The renaming was necessary due to the addition of 
     the NDC SENT field (#12) under the same multiple that is being created
     by this project (see below item 11).
   
 11. A new NDC SENT field (#12) is being created under the CMOP EVENT 
     multiple (#52.01) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), to store the NDC
     that was transmission to CMOP. This field is used for electronic 
     billing purposes to analyze the difference between the NDC sent to
     CMOP and the actual dispensed NDC by the CMOP facility.
  
 12. A new DAW CODE field (#81) is being created on the PRESCRIPTION
     file (#52) and also under the REFILL multiple (#52.1) of the
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This field contains the NCPDP DAW used in the
     electronic claims submission to third party payers (insurance
     companies).
  
 13. A new RE-TRANSMIT FLAG field (#82) is being created on the 
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and also under the REFILL multiple (#52.1) of 
     the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This field is used to indicate that a
     claim should be electronically re-transmitted to the 3rd party payer
     (insurance company). It will be primarily used by CMOP and local mail
     prescriptions.
    
 14. A new multiple REJECT INFO field (#52.25) has been created on the
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to store information about DUR and Refill Too
     Soon Rejects returned by 3rd party payers. 
     The following fields are part of this multiple:
  
         .01   NCPDP REJECT CODE      
           1   DATE/TIME DETECTED     
           2   PAYER MESSAGE          
           3   REASON

          13   CLOSE COMMENTS
          14   REASON FOR SERVICE CODE
          15   PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CODE
          16   RESPONSE ID
          17   OTHER REJECTS     
          18   DUR TEXT          
          19   RESULT OF SERVICE CODE
          20   INSURANCE NAME    
          21   GROUP NUMBER      
          22   CARDHOLDER ID 
          23   RE-OPENED
  
     Two new cross-references named "REJDAT" and "REJSTS" were created for
     this multiple in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The "REJDAT" uses the
     DATE/TIME DETECTED field (#1) and the "REJSTS" uses the STATUS field
     (#9).
  
 15. This patch corrects the second line of the routine PSOORUT1 by adding 
     the patch number 14 to the list of patches. The patch number 14 was
     unintentionally removed by patch PSO*7*132.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP IN THE
 EXACT ORDER INDICATED BELOW. ONCE STARTED, THE INSTALLATION NEEDS TO BE
 COMPLETED. FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION (ONCE STARTED) WILL
 LIKELY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR USERS OF THE 6 APPLICATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS 
 PROJECT.
  
 BEFORE PROCEEDING, please read item number 12.2 and make sure you have the
 information needed in order to complete this installation.
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of these patches. These
 patches should be installed during non-peak hours to avoid disruptions.
  
 Installation should take approximately 15 minutes.
   
 Notes: 1. You cannot queue this installation for a later time, because you
           will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
        2. DO NOT install patch PSX*2*48 when prescriptions are being
           transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
           complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        3. For existing test sites, stop the BPS NCPDP logical link.  Turn off
           the logical link using the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option, which
           is on the Filer and Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER
           LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When 
           prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter BPS NCPDP and when 
           asked whether it is "Okay to shut down this job?", enter YES.
  
  
 1.  These patches will be sent to your system upon release from the National
     Patch Module:
     
       - Patch PSS*1*90
       - Patch PSX*2*48
       - Patch PRCA*4.5*230
  
     Obtain the host file ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID, which contains the following
     three KIDS build distributions:
       
         PSO*7.0*148
         BPS*1.0*1
         IB*2.0*276
  
 Sites may retrieve the host file in one of the following ways:
  
  1.1 The preferred method is to FTP the file from download.vista.med.va.gov,
     which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
  
  1.2 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
   
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, for each of the three patches (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and
    PRCA*4.5*230), you may select to use the following options:
  
     3.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     3.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     3.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     Note: When prompted for INSTALL NAME, you should enter the corresponding
           names for each patch as shown below:
  
               PATCH                  INSTALL NAME

               PSX*2*48               PSX*2.0*48
               PRCA*4.5*230           PRCA*4.5*230
   
 4.  From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and for 
     each one of the three patches (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and PRCA*4.5*230) follow 
     the instructions below: 
   
     4.1. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter the corresponding
          name for the patch you are installing (see table above).
   
     4.2. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
           YES//", respond "NO." 
  
     4.3. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols? YES//", respond "NO."
  
     4.4. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and
          DO NOT queue to P-Message.
   
 5.  After the installation of the 3 patches is complete (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48,

           Please, contact your Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) business
           department prior to installation to determine who will be the 
           coordinator for this new mail group. This mail group will be used

 16. TEST SITES ONLY: A post-installation step for test sites is to restart the 
     BPS NCPDP Logical link.  To turn on the logical link use the  Start/Stop 
     Links [HL START] option, which is on the Filer and Link Management Options 
     option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] 
     option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP" and 
     that will enable the logical link.
  
 17. The functionality will be implemented at sites in a phased schedule.
     Before performing the steps to activate ePharmacy functionality, all 
     non-test sites should wait to be contacted by the Chief Business 
     Office (CBO).
