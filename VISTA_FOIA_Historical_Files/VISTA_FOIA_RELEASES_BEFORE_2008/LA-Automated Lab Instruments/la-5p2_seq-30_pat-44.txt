Associated patches: (v)LA*5.2*27   <<= must be installed BEFORE `LA*5.2*44'

Subject: HL7 MESSAGE TYPE PROBLEM

Category:

  - Other

Description: 
============

  This patch will prevent a null subscript error from occurring when using
  option LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP] after the installation of the HL7 patch
  HL*1.6*14.
  
  1. Problem: A null subscript error was occurring at VER+3 in routine
              LA7VSTP because the software was not properly quitting when
              checking for the existence of an entry in HL7 MESSAGE TYPE
              file (#771.2).
  
    Solution: The code has been changed to use a FileMan DIC call to
              perform the lookup of an entry in this file.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  -------------------------
  The patch is distributed in KIDS format in a PackMan message.
  
  The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
  can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  However the following conditions apply:
  
     -Users should not be using option LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP].
      The LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP] option will be placed out of service
      during this install.
  
  Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
  Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  If the routine LA7VSTP is a mapped routine, appropriate action should be
  taken to disable the mapped routine at the beginning of the patch
  installation process and to insure proper updating of mapped routines
  afterward.  Also, if the routine LA7VSTP resides in multiple locations
  within the system configuration, all routine directories should be updated
  appropriately.
  
  NOTE: MailMan and KERNEL patches must be current on the target system to
        avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  NOTE: This KIDS install places the option LEDI Setup [LA7V SETUP]
        out of service during the install. The option is not added or
        changed by this patch. If KIDS prompts:
  
        "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? YES// NO"
  
        The site can answer "NO" if they choose since the option
        is unchanged.
  
        Additionally, if performing the KIDS Compare option, KIDS will
        report that this option is being changed. This is a false
        message since the option is only being disabled during the
        install by KIDS. It is included in the KIDS build only for the
        purpose of being disabled during the install by KIDS.
  
  
  1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
  4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
  5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
      all routines have the correct checksums.
  
  6.  If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
      prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
      option at this time.  You may also compare the routine in your
      production account to the routine in the patch by using the 'Compare
      a Transport Global to Current System' option (see note above).
      These options can both be found under the 'Installation' menu.
  
  7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package 'LA*5.2*44'.  When prompted 'Want to
      DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',
      choose 'NO'. KIDS will disable the appropriate option during the
      install (see note above).
  
  8.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  9.  Routine LA44 can be deleted after successful patch installation.
