     HBPC User Information:
     =====================
  
     Patch addresses the following items:
       -  Provider Mismatch visits being omitted, your site may or may
          not have any missing visits
  
       -  Add optional selection criteria for sorting by number of visits
          on Total Visits by Date Range Report
  
       -  Remove potential for Provider Number with > 4 digits
  
       -  Prevent possibility of duplicate transmission to Austin
  
       -  Discharge date missing being overlooked as discharge error
  
       -  Only 1 of multiple visits on same day to same patient would print
          on Transmit History Report
  
  
    User Steps for Provider Mismatch Visit Omission:
    ===============================================
  
     1)  ensure patch 13 is installed
  
     2)  generate Austin transmit file using the following option sequence:
             -  run Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE], setting
                Number of Visit Days to Scan system parameter to large
                enough number to include all FY99 data (10/1/98 forward)
             -  print Form Errors Report [HBHCRP1]
             -  correct visit errors
             -  Edit Form Errors Data [HBHCUPD]
             -  repeat sequence as needed
  
     3)  Once 'No errors found' message is received, then Transmit File to
         Austin [HBHCXMT], regardless if it's the proper time of the month
         or not, or it's OK to wait until the next normal processing cycle.
         Any missing visits that have been located will be included.
