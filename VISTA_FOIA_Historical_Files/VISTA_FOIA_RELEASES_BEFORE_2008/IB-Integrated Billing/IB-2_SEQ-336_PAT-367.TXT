Subject: DSS STOP CODES AND RX COPAY FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch adds and modifies Stop Codes in the IB CLINIC STOP CODE BILLABLE

 software uses incomplete/incorrect information from income tests in
 calculating the Rx copay exemption.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD168809 Stop Code 568 Generating Copay Charges
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  Nine Stop Codes for FY 05 were never added to the IB CLINIC STOP CODE
  BILLABLE TYPES (#352.5) file and are erroneously incurring charges when
  they should not.   
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Add the Stop Codes to the IB CLINIC STOP CODE BILLABLE TYPES (#352.5)
  file with effective dates of 10/01/04 and marked as NON BILLABLE.
  
 2) HD163928 Electronic Error Report - Error at EN+29^IBCERP2
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  While running the Electronic Error Report [IBCE ELECTRONIC ERROR REPORT],
  if the site running the report has any bills in the REQUEST MRA state, a
  subscript error will occur because bills that are in that state do not
  have a current payer responsible for the bill in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399)
  file.   
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  This report will handle this situation in the same way the rest of IB
  handles it, by first determining the payer sequence and then determining
  which carrier is at that sequence.
  
 3) HD138944 Inconsistent EXEMPTION calculation
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  When the Manually Change Copay Exemption (Hardships) [IB RX HARDSHIP]
  option computes the medication copayment exemption status, if the patient
  is not auto exempt it gets the most recent test from the ANNUAL MEANS
  TEST (#408.31) file and uses that information to compute the status 
  regardless of whether or not it is an IVM converted test or not, in cases
  where the last test is a converted test it will always compute to
  EXEMPT by reasoning of Income<Pension.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Before using the test from the ANNUAL MEANS TEST (408.31) file
  to calculate Copay exemption status verify that it is not a converted
  test.  If it is a converted test use the status found in the 
  BILLING PATIENT (#354) file as the current status.
  
 4) HD176697 INCORRECT RX COPAY STATUS
    
  Problem: 
  --------
  When a Copay Test is changed to NO LONGER APPLICABLE for whatever reason
  a call is eventually made to Integrated Billing to compare the current
  status in the BILLING PATIENT (#354) file with what is computed.  If the
  last test on file is a converted test it will always compute to EXEMPT by
  reasoning of INCOME<PENSION, because there is not any income stored with
  a converted test. Because the computed status does not match the status
  in the BILLING PATIENT (#354) file it creates a new entry and updates the
  BILLING PATIENT (#354) file with the newly computed status.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Before using income information from a test to calculate the patients
  Copay Exemption status it will first verify that the test it is using is
  not a converted test.  If it is, it will pass back the current status of
  that patient from the BILLING PATIENT (#354) file.
  
 5) HD183979 Problem with Copay after stop code patch installed SD*5.3*500
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  Stop Codes modified or added with patch SD*5.3*500, were never updated in
  the IB CLINIC STOP CODE BILLABLE TYPES (#352.5) file.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------  
  Update the IB CLINIC STOP CODE BILLABLE TYPES (#352.5) file as follows:
  
  New Stopcode
