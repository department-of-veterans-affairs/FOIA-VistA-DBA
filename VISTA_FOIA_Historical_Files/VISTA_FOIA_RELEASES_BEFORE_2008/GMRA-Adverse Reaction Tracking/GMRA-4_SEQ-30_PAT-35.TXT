 unassessed allergies.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user runs the report List by Location of Undocumented Allergies
 [GMRA PRINT-PATIENTS NOT ASKED] option, the listing showed a patient that
 had allergies , were autoverified, and should not have shown up on the
 list.

 assessment if the assessment was entered after the end date of
 the range.  For this reason, it is recommended to end the range
 with today. This can be done with an entry of 'T' (for Today) at
 the 'Enter END Date (time optional): T//' prompt.
