Description:
============

 Reasonable Charges version 2.0 is a substantial enhancement to the 
 existing Reasonable Charges billed to Third Party Payers.  The Integrated 
 Billing Charge Master and Bill/Claims functionality have been modified to 
 support the requirements of billing with Reasonable Charges v2.0.
                 
 Implementation of Reasonable Charges is accomplished in two parts:
 o  The first part is installation this patch, IB*2.0*245.
 o  The second part is the upload of the Reasonable Charges data files and 
    calculation of site specific charges, which results in the loading of the 
    appropriate Reasonable Charges into the sites IB Charge Master.
                
 A significant change with version 2.0 of Reasonable Charges is the 
 restructuring of the charges.  In previous versions, there was no 
 differentiation between types of sites, resulting in one set of charges 
 for all outpatient care and one set of charges for all professional care.  
 With this version sites are defined as either Provider Based or Non-
 Provider Based, and there are now 4 separate sets of charges for the care 
 that may be provided:
                 
 Inpatient Facility Care:         Facility Charge Per Diem by DRG
                                  Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                                  Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                  
 Skilled Nursing/Sub-Acute Care:  Facility Charge Per Diem by Bedsection
                                  Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                                  Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                         
 Provider Based Outpatient Care:  Facility Charge Per Diem for Partial Hosp
                                  Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                                  Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                     
 Non-Provider Outpatient Care:    Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                                  (Freestanding sites)
                  
 The Provider Based/Non-Provider Based assignment is pre-defined for each 
 site and is included in the charge host files.
                                
 The Provider Based sites include:
 -  VAMC's that provide both Inpatient and Outpatient care will receive the  
    Inpatient, Skilled Nursing, and Provider Based Outpatient charges.
 -  Large Outpatient sites, that only provide outpatient care, will receive  
    only the Provider Based Outpatient charges.
                               
 The Non-Provider Based Outpatient Care sites are also called Freestanding. 
 These are facilities that only provide professional services like a 
 doctor's office, and therefore will receive only professional charges.
                               
 A second significant change with Reasonable Charge v2.0 is that some 
 charges are now directly associated with both a CPT/HCPCS code and a 
 Modifier.  In this circumstance, the charge will only be applied to the 
 bill if the procedure has the assigned modifier.  For example, many of the 
 Prosthetics procedures only have a charge in association with modifiers 
 NU, RR, or UE.
                                 
                                  
 The following is the description of the individual changes for Reasonable 
 Charges v2.0 and the explanation of how the above charge definitions are 
 implemented.
                                                             
 INPATIENT CHARGES
 -----------------
 In previous versions, Inpatient care was billed using a DRG per diem 
 facility charge and the same professional charges as used for Outpatient 
 care.
                               
 Now, Inpatient care will have sets of charges only applicable to Inpatient 
 care:
 -  Inpatient Facility Charge Per Diem by DRG, Ancillary and Room&Board
    updated to differentiate between ICU and Non-ICU care.
 -  Inpatient Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
 -  Inpatient Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                               
 Billing for this type of care is essentially unchanged, except CPT/HCPCS 
 codes entered on the Facility bill may now receive a charge.
                               
 Inpatient charges will only be available at sites that provide Inpatient 
 care.
                               
 Note that with the identification of a Skilled Nursing or Sub-Acute care 
 date range, it is now possible that not all care on an Inpatient bill is 
 subject to these Inpatient charges.   
                               
                               
 SKILLED NURSING AND SUB-ACUTE CHARGES
 -------------------------------------
 In previous versions, Skilled Nursing and Sub-Acute care was billed with a 
 daily per diem and the same professional charges as used for Inpatient and 
 Outpatient care.
                               
 Now, Skilled Nursing and Sub-Acute Care will have sets of charges only 
 applicable to SNF/SA care:
 -  SNF/SA Facility Charge Per Diem by Bedsection, one all inclusive charge
 -  SNF/SA Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
 -  SNF/SA Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                               
 The Skilled Nursing/Sub-Acute per diem charge previously needed to be 
 manually added to a bill.  This will no longer be necessary.
                               
 The capability has been added to identify a range of dates on the bill 
 that were either Skilled Nursing or Sub-Acute.  On an Inpatient bill, 
 within these dates, the SNF/SA charges will be applied.  Outside these 
 dates, the regular Inpatient charges will be applied.  (Screen 4, option 1)
                               
 Also, as with Inpatient billing, CPT/HCPCS codes entered within the 
 SNF/SA timeframe of a Facility bill may now receive a charge.
                               
 Skilled Nursing/Sub-Acute charges will only be available at sites that 
 provide Inpatient care.
                               
                               
 OUTPATIENT CHARGES
 ------------------
 Billing for Outpatient care at a Provider Based site is largely unchanged 
 structurally from previous versions, except the charges are only
 applicable to Outpatient care.
                               
 Outpatient care will have sets of charges only applicable to Outpatient 
 care:
 -  Outpatient Facility Charge Per Diem for Partial Hospitalization
 -  Outpatient Facility Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
 -  Outpatient Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                               
 The Partial Hospitalization charge is new with v2.0.  This is a daily per 
 diem and must be manually added to a bill as the SNF per diem was 
 previously.  (screen 7, option 6)
                               
 Outpatient charges will be available at all Provider Based sites, this 
 includes sites that provide Inpatient and Outpatient care, as well as
 sites that only provide Outpatient care.
                               
                               
 FREESTANDING CHARGES
 --------------------
 Freestanding charges are completely new with RC v2.0.  Freestanding is a 
 type of facility identified as Non-Provider Based that provides only 
 professional services. 
                               
 Non-Provider based care will have a set of charges only applicable to 
 Freestanding sites:
 -  Freestanding Professional Charges by CPT/HCPCS code
                               
 Although all charges at these sites are identified as professional, many 
 of the procedures billed as Facility charges at the other types of sites 
 will be available as Professional charges at these sites.
                               
                               
 INTENSIVE CARE (ICU)
 --------------------
 There are now separate Inpatient Facility (DRG) charges associated with 
 ICU care verses Non-ICU care.  
                               
 ICU care is identified as the following Facility Specialties:
                               
        12  MEDICAL ICU/CCU
        16  CARDIAC-STEP DOWN UNIT
        17  TELEMETRY
        63  SURGICAL ICU
               
                               
 PROSTHETICS
 -----------
 Many Prosthetics items will now be billed using HCPCS charges.  Therefore 
 the VA Cost Charges for Prosthetics should no longer be used.
                               
                               
 CHARGE SIGNIFICANT MODIFIERS
 ----------------------------
 There are now many charges associated with the combination of CPT/HCPCS 
 code and modifier.  These charges will only be applied if the procedure is 
 assigned the modifier on the bill.  Therefore, it is important that the 
 correct modifiers are used on bills.  The order of modifier assignment on
 the bill is also important.  The first charge significant modifier 
 assigned will be used to identify the charge.
                               
 The Charge Significant Modifiers are:  26, TC, KM, KN, NU, UE, RR.
                               
                               
 MODIFIER CHARGE ADJUSTMENT
 --------------------------
 Certain modifiers have been identified that will adjust a procedures 
 charge.  The adjustment is related to the modifier and will therefore be 
 applied to any procedure that has that modifier assigned.
                                
 The Modifier and their Adjustment Factor:
               22   1.20
               50   1.54
               51    .94
               52    .70
               53    .97
               62    .92
               80    .31
               QZ   2.00
                               
 If multiple adjustment modifiers are assigned to a procedure, then all of 
 the adjustments will be applied to the charge.
                               
                               
 CERTIFIED REGISTER NURSE ANESTHETIST (CRNA)
 -------------------------------------------
 Billing for CRNA requires specific identification of how the care was 
 accomplished to result in the correct charge:                                
 -  If a procedure is preformed by a CRNA, then there is a Provider Discount 
    of 50%.
 -  If a procedure is assigned modifier QZ - CRNA SERVICE WITHOUT MEDICAL 
    DIRECTION BY A PHYSICIAN, then there is a Modifier Adjustment of twice 
    the regular charge.
                               
 Therefore, a procedure preformed by a CRNA, but without supervision, will 
 receive the full standard charge.  In this case both the CRNA provider and
 the QZ modifier must be assigned to the procedure on the bill.
                               
                               
 SPECIAL UNIT CHARGES
 --------------------
 There are three types of procedures that are associated with an 
 incremental charge and possibly a base charge.  In these cases, a subunit 
 of charge is based on the type of care: Observation with Hours subunit, 
 Ambulance with Miles subunit, and Anesthesia with Minutes subunit.
                               
 When one of these types of charges are calculated, the Incremental charge 
 multiplied by the subunit is added to the base charge.  This results in a 
 final charge for the procedure being added to the bill with a unit of 1.
                               
 Therefore, the charges for each of these types of care is modified based on 
 the specific care given in that instance, rather than the same charge     
 whenever the procedure is preformed.
                               
 The ?CHG display on the bill has been modified to display a comment 
 explaining the subunits used to calculate the final charge.
                               
                               
 OBSERVATION CHARGES
 -------------------
 Observation will be billed using CPT codes and are one of the Special Unit 
 Charges.  The facility charges for observation consist of both an 
 Incremental charge for the number of hours of Observation care, and a base
 charge that is applied once for each instance of the CPT code.
                               
 The number of hours of Observation care will be asked when a procedure is 
 added to a bill, if the charge for that procedure is an Incremental Hours 
 charge, i.e. Observation Hours will be asked when an Observation CPT code 
 is added to a Facility bill.  There are no Observation care charges 
 available at Freestanding sites.
                               
 Observation Hours will be rounded to the nearest hour to calculate the 
 charge subunits.
                               
 If the Observation care is less than 30 minutes, then there will be no 
 charge.
                               
                               
 AMBULANCE CHARGES
 -----------------
 Ambulance Mileage procedures are one of the Special Unit Charges.  These 
 procedures have an Incremental charge based on miles, but do not have a 
 base charge since the administrative portion of the procedure is assigned 
 to another CPT/HCPCS code.
                               
 When Ambulance is billed, both the mileage CPT/HCPCS and the
 Administrative CPT/HCPCS should be billed.
                               
 The number of miles of transport will be asked when a procedure is added 
 to a bill, if the charge for that procedure is an incremental miles charge, 
 i.e. Ambulance Miles will be asked when an Ambulance Mileage CPT/HCPCS 
 code is added to a bill.  At Provider Based sites, all Ambulance Miles 
 CPT/HCPCS codes are facility charges, and at Freestanding sites, these are
 professional charges.
                               
 Ambulance Miles will be rounded to the nearest mile to calculate the 
 charge subunits.
                               
                               
 ANESTHESIA CHARGES
 ------------------
 Anesthesia procedures are one of the Special Unit Charges.  The charges 
 for anesthesia consist of both an incremental charge based on the number 
 of minutes of anesthesia, and a base charge that is applied once for each 
 instance of the CPT.
                               
 The number of minutes of anesthesia will be asked when a procedure is 
 added to a bill, if the charge for that procedure is an incremental 
 anesthesia charge, i.e. Minutes will be asked when an Anesthesia CPT/HCPCS
 code is added to a bill.  At Provider Based sites, all Anesthesia
 CPT/HCPCS codes are facility charges, and at Freestanding sites, these are
 professional charges.
                               
 Anesthesia Minutes are rounded to get subunits based on the following 
 formula: 15 minutes = 1 subunit with rounding down after 4 minutes.  
 1-19 minutes = 1 subunit, 20-34 minutes = 2 subunits, 35-49 minutes = 3 
 subunits, etc.
                               
                               
 MULTIPLE SURGICAL PROCEDURE DISCOUNT
 ------------------------------------
 In previous versions of RC, if multiple surgical procedures from a single 
 encounter were assigned to a bill, then a discount was applied to the 
 facility charges.  The list of procedures this discount applies to has 
 been changed:
                               
 Pre v2.0:  10000-69999,93501-93533

 21325-21355, 21390-27446, 27496-28899, 29800-30220, 30310-31205, 
 31231-31420, 31502-33249, 33284-35903, 36260-36425, 36468-36491,

 58800-61623, 61626-61791, 61880-62230, 62263-62365, 63001-63615, 
 63660-64530, 64585-65175, 65235-65426, 65435-65436, 65600-65755, 
 65770-67450, 67505-67810, 67825-67935, 67950-68020, 68100-68135, 
 68320-68750, 68770, 68810-69150, 69205, 69220-69700, 69711-69979, 
 91122, 92018, 92230-92235, 92502, 92511, 92973-92977, 92980-92998,

 PRIMARY/SECONDARY BUNDLED DISCOUNT
 ----------------------------------
 There are certain sets of procedures that are defined as primary and 
 secondary.  If both are performed, then the cost of the secondary procedure 
 is bundled into the cost of the primary procedure.  If only primary or 
 only secondary are performed, then the full cost is billed.  With RC v2.0,
 both primary and secondary procedures are exported with a full charge.  
 Therefore, if both primary and secondary procedures are performed during an 
 encounter, then the charges of each will be discounted to equal the total 
 of the primary charge.
                               
 Primary Procedures: (5082)
 10021-38206, 38220-43750, 43760-61791, 61795-64530, 64553-65755,

 BILL PROCEDURE MANIPULATION
 ---------------------------
 Some procedures have a structure to billing, such as procedures with 
 modifier 26 should not be billed on an Institutional bill.  Also,
 certain charges are associated with procedure-modifier pairs and will
 only have a charge applied to the bill if the procedure has that modifier
 on the bill.  To support this procedure modifier structure, the procedures
 added when a bill is created will be adjusted according to the following
 rules:
                  
 -  Modifier TC will be removed from all procedures on Facility bills
 -  Procedures with modifier 26 in the Clinical data will not be added to 
    Facility bills.
 -  Procedures with modifier TC in the Clinical data will not be added to 
    Professional bills.
 -  Modifier 26 will be added to any procedure on a Professional bill if 
    the only charge for the procedure is 26 modified.
 -  Modifier 26 will be deleted from any procedure on an Institutional bill 
    if the only professional charge for the procedure is 26 modified.
 -  The previous version of auto adding of modifier 26 to a pre-defined 
    list of procedures will not apply to RC v2.0 charges.
  
 The above rules are all applied when the Auto Biller creates a Bill and 
 when an institutional bill is copied to create a professional bill.  The 
 last 3 rules will be applied when Charge Type is updated on the bill 
 (screen 6/7, option 1).
  
                               
 BUNDLED PROCEDURE CODES
 -----------------------
 There are certain procedures that have different CPT codes for their 
 global and component pieces.  When creating both an institutional and a 
 professional bill for the procedure, the global code should not be used.  
 The technical component should be placed on the institutional bill and the 
 professional component should be placed on the professional bill.
                      
 The charges reflect this structure, therefore the global CPT code for 
 these procedures has no charge at Provider Based sites.  The following are 
 the procedures and the bill they should be on.
                      
    Global           Technical          Professional
    93000            93005              93010
    93015            93017              93016 & 93018
    93040            93041              93042
    93224            93225 & 93226      93227
    93230            93231 & 93232      93233
    93235            93236              93237
    93268            93270 & 93271      93272
    93720            93721              93722
    93784            93788              93790
    94014            94015              94016
                     
 To assist in handling these codes the split will be done automatically:
 -  on an institutional bill if the global procedure is found in encounter 
    data in PCE, then on the bill the global is replaced with the technical 
    component.
 -  on a professional bill if the global procedure is found in encounter 
    data in PCE, then on the bill the technical component is replaced with 
    the professional technical component.
                 
 The above rules are applied when the Auto Biller creates a bill, when an 
 institutional bill is copied to create a professional bill, and when 
 Charge Type is updated on the bill (screen 6/7, option 1).
                               
                               
 BILL DEFINITIION
 ---------------
 Before charges are calculated for any bill, the division associated with 
 that bill will be evaluated.  If the division is a Freestanding site, then 
 the bills' Charge Type will be changed to Professional.
  
                               
 ?CPT HELP DISPLAY
 -----------------
 A new help inquiry has been added to Enter/Edit a bill, ?CPT.  This 
 inquiry will display the charges related to the user selected CPT/HCPCS 
 code.
                   
  
 ?CHG HELP DISPLAY
 -----------------
 This display of bill charges has been updated to include comments about 
 the special unit charges and the various charge discounts/adjustments 
 discussed above.
             
 It is important to note that this display may not always be accurate when 
 displaying potential professional charges on an institutional bill.  Since 
 some professional charges now require modifier 26 to receive a charge and 
 that modifier will not be on the institutional bill, this display will not 
 show the 26 modified charge.
                
                   
 BILL DISPLAY
 ------------
 The Rx Providers from Outpatient Pharmacy has been added to the display of 
 Prescriptions on the bill (screen 7 option 5)
     
     
 Changes to the Charge Master
 ----------------------------
                  
 -  The existing Rate Schedules for Reasonable Charges inactive 12/18/03.
 -  New Rate Schedules are added for Reasonable Charges effective 12/19/03.
                                
 -  New Billing Rates added for charges specific to Hours, Miles, Minutes. 
 -  New Billing Rates added for SNF and Partial Hospitalization perdiems.
                       
 List of Charges Sets for Reasonable Charges v2.0
 ------------------------------------------------
                         
 Each Charge Set now indicates which type of care it applies to:
 -  INPT: the facility and professional charge is only applied to an 
    Inpatient Provider Based bill (excluding SNF)
 -  SNF:  the facility and professional charge is only applied to SNF care 
    as defined on the bill (screen 4, option 1) on an Inpatient Provider 
    Based bill
 -  OPT: the facility and professional charge is only applied to an 
    Outpatient Provider Based Bill
 -  FS: the professional charge is only applied to an Outpatient 
    Non-Provider Based bill 
 In each of the above cases the Provider Based, Non-Provider Based 
 designation for the bill is determined by the Bill Division.
                           
 In the Charge Sets Name:
 -  HR indicates CPT/HCPCS charges based on Hours, Observation care.
 -  ML indicates CPT/HCPCS charges based on Miles, Ambulance transportation
 -  MN indicates CPT/HCPCS charges based on Minutes, Anesthesia
 -  PR indicates all other CPT/HCPCS charges

 Upload Instructions:
 ====================
                 
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v2.0 Host Files in ASCII format (see 
 previous section).
                       
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and 
 print the Billing Region report to find which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
 that will need new charges loaded.
                   
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option to 
 load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which 
 care is billed at your site.  Steps 4-7
                
 Step 4:  Select 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
 ---------------------------------------
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges 
 for individual Divisions.
            
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask 
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 2
                 
   - If there exists any charges previously calculated for a division, they 
     will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.  
     Select Yes - delete the previously calculated charges.
                     
   - If there exists any previously loaded host files for an RC version, 
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.  
     Select Yes only if the files are not for the correct version.  
             
     When loading Reasonable Charges v2.0 the IBRC0312x.TXT files may be 
     used multiple times without reloading.  
     Select No if the files are IBRC0312x.TXT and you are loading RC v2.0
                 
   Select Division:  select the division number to load charges for.  This 
   should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing Regions 
   determined previously.
              
 Step 5: Select 3 - Check Data Validity
 ---------------------------------------
 This is optional but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for the 
 first division loaded.  If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, 
 then check that the latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.  
                
 Step 6: Select 4 - Load into Charge Master
 ------------------------------------------
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
               
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region list determined previously.
                   
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, selection 2, to calculate RC v2 charges for a division
 o  Option 4 to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site or a site that may have 
 changed it's division number then, extra care is needed to ensure the set 
 up of the Charge Master is correct.  Following sections provide some 
 additional information about the upload.

 General Upload Instructions:
 ----------------------------
 Retrieve the Reasonable Charges Host Files in ASCII format for the 
 version desired.
                       
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and 
 print the Billing Region report to find which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.
                   
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option to 
 load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which 
 care is billed at your site:
                      
   1.3       Load RC into XTMP
             Load the host files and calculate the charges for a division 
             at your site.  Possible Selections:               
                  1         Reasonable Charges version 1.0
                  1.1       Reasonable Charges version 1.1
                  1.2       Reasonable Charges version 1.2
                  1.4       Reasonable Charges version 1.4
                  2         Reasonable Charges version 2.0
                      
   2         Assign Charge Set
             Assign or re-assign the charges calculated to the correct 
             Charge Sets.  This option is only needed if the Charges 
             calculated are assigned to a Division number in the new 
             version that is different than the Division number used in 
             previous versions of RC.
                       
   3         Check Data Validity
             Runs through the load into the Charge Master without 
             actually making any changes and reports any problems found.
                       
   4         Load into Charge Master
             Load the updated charges into the Charge Master for 
             the site requested.
                   
   5         Delete XTMP files
             Deletes all temporary files created for the upload process.  
             This selection is optional, all temporary files are deleted 
             automatically after 2 days.
                      
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable 
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
 o  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 o  Option 4 to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                      
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site or a site that may have 
 changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure the set 
 up of the Charge Master is correct.  Following sections provide some 
 additional information about the upload.
