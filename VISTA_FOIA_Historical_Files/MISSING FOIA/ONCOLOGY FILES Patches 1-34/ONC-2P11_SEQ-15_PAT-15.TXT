 ===============================================================================
  1) AJCC CANCER STAGING MANUAL, FIFTH EDITION
 
     Oncology 2.11 has been enhanced to include the AJCC Staging Manual, 
     Fifth Edition changes.  The following enhancements have been made:
 
     a) Primaries with a date of diagnosis of 1/1/98 or later will use the
        5th edition TNM classification codes and Stage Grouping rules.  The
        details of these changes can be found in the AJCC Comparison Guide,
        Fourth to Fifth Edition.
 
     b) The TNM classification help has been enhanced to provide the user
        with the complete DEFINITION OF TNM text as it appears in the 5th
        edition manual.
 
     c) The "Cancer Identification" and "Stage of Disease at Diagnosis"
        abstract entry screens have been redesigned.
 
 ===============================================================================
  2) UPDATE TO ROADS FOR 1998
 
     The following 1998 ROADS changes/updates have been incorporated into
     Oncology 2.11:
 
     CANCER IDENTIFICATION
 
     a) GRADE/DIFFERENTIATION (#164.43) ROADS 111
 
        Code 8 (Natural killer cell) has been added.
 
     b) TUMOR MARKER 1 (#165.5, #25.1) ROADS 116
        TUMOR MARKER 2 (#165.5, #25.2) ROADS 117
        TUMOR MARKER 3 (#165.5, #25.3) ROADS 117A
 
        Codes 1 (Positive/elevated), 2 (Negative/normal) and 3 (Borderline)
        were made unavailable to testicular cancer cases.
        Codes 4 (Range 1), 5 (Range 2) and 6 (Range 3) were added and made
        available to testis only cases.
        TUMOR MARKER 3 (lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)) was added for testicular
        cancer only.
        The TUMOR MARKER prompts were made variable depending on the ICDO-
        TOPOGRAPHY (#165.5, #20) or HISTOLOGY (#165.5, #22) values.
        e.g. Breast primaries will have a TUMOR MARKER 1 prompt of ESTROGEN
             RECEPTOR ASSAY (ERA).
             Prostate primaries will have a TUMOR MARKER 2 prompt of 
             PROSTATIC SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA).
 
     STAGE OF DISEASE AT DIAGNOSIS
 
     a) NODES EXAMINED (REGIONAL) (#165.5, #33) ROADS 129
 
        The following code descriptions have been changed:
 
        90 = 90 or more nodes examined
        95 = No nodes removed, aspiration performed
        96 = Node removal as a sampling, # unk
        97 = Node removal as dissection, # unk
        98 = Nodes surgically removed, # unk
        99 = Unk; not stated; death cert only
 
     b) MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (CLIN) (#165.5, #69.3)
 
        MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (CLIN) will no longer be asked for 1998 cases.
        This field is associated with the CLINICAL STAGE (PREFIX/SUFFIX)
        DESCRIPTOR (ROADS 150) code 4 Y (Classification during or after 
        initial multimodality therapy) which is now applicable to pathologic
        staging only. 
 
     c) DATE OF 1ST POSITIVE BIOPSY (#165.5, #137) ROADS 177
 
        This field has been added.
 
     d) DIAGNOSTIC AND STAGING PROCEDURES - ROADS 178-178E
 
        The following new fields have been added:
 
        For BREAST sites:
        BIOPSY PROCEDURE               (#165.5, #141)
        GUIDANCE                       (#165,5, #142)
        PALPABILITY OF PRIMARY         (#165.5, #143) 
        FIRST DETECTED BY              (#165.5, #144)
 
        For PROSTATE sites:
        BIOPSY PROCEDURE               (#165.5, #141)
        GUIDANCE                       (#165,5, #142)
        APPROACH FOR BIOPSY OF PRIMARY (#165.5, #145) 
        BIOPSY OF OTHER THAN PRIMARY   (#165.5, #146)
 
        If the primary site is other than breast or prostate, these fields
        will be stuffed with "0".  If BIOPSY PROCEDURE is "0" (Not done,
        not a separate procedure) or "9" (Unknown/death cert only), the
        remaining DIAGNOSTIC AND STAGING PROCEDURES fields will be stuffed
        with "0" or "9" respectively.

  3) MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
 
     a) At the SITE/GP (#165.5, #.01) prompt if the user entered "BLADDER"
        he/she would be presented with the following choices:

     c) RACE DEFAULT
 
        ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
          AI Complete Abstract
 
        The RACE (#160, #8) prompt will now have a default of "white" or
        "black" depending on the value of RACE (#2, #.06) in the PATIENT
        file.
     
     d) PROTOCOL STUFFING
 
        ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
          EE     Abstract Edit Primary
            4.  First Course of Treatment
 
        If PROTOCOL ELIGIBILITY STATUS (#165.5, #346) does not equal "1" (On
        protocol), PROTOCOL PARTICIPATION (#165.5, #560) and YEAR PUT ON
        PROTOCOL (#165.5, #133) will be stuffed with "00" (Not on/NA) and
        "0000" respectively.
  
        e.g. PROTOCOL ELIGIBILITY STATUS: 0  Not available
             PROTOCOL PARTICIPATION........: Not on/NA
             YEAR PUT ON PROTOCOL..........: 0000
 
     e) COUNTY AT DIAGNOSIS
 
        ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
          EE     Abstract Edit Primary
            1.  Patient Identification
 
        COUNTY AT DIAGNOSIS (#165.5, #10) will now accept the following 
        codes:
 
        998 Patient resides outside of the state of the reporting institution
        999 Unknown county/country
 
        NOTE: Since every county must be associated with a state, these new
              codes have been associated with the state OTHER.  The word
              OTHER will therefore display when choosing either of these
              codes.
 
     f) TOPOGRAPY DEPENDENT/SITE-SPECIFIC FIELDS
 
        ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
          EE     Abstract Edit Primary
            2.  Cancer Identification
 
        The several ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) fields have site-specific
        values.  Changing the primary's ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY (#20) value to
        a value outside of its site group may cause these fields' values
        to become inappropriate for the new topography.  Therefore, logic
        has been added to the ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY field which will detect a
        topography change and will delete the site-specific values if the
        change is outside of the original site group.
        
        Topography change example:
 
        "ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY: CERVIX, ENDOCERVIX// UTERUS, LOWER SEGMENT C54.0 182.1
 
        You have changed the ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY value.  The new topography
        value is outside of the old topography's site group.  This change
        may affect the validity of all site-specific fields.  Therefore,
        these fields have been initialized and need to be re-entered:
 
          TUMOR MARKERS                   
          EXTENSION
          LYMPH NODES
          CLINICAL STAGING                (all fields)
          PATHOLOGIC STAGING              (all fields)
          DIAGNOSTIC & STAGING PROCEDURES (all fields)
          CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY         (all fields)"
 
     g) CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO THE ICD-O-2 CODES FOR ACUTE LEUKEMIA
 
        The NAACCR Uniform Data Standards Committee have made the
        following changes/additions to the ICD-O-2 codes for acute
        leukemia.  These changes include the FAB (French American
        British) classifications and require the addition of 5 new 
        codes.  These changes affect the following ICDO MORPHOLOGY
        (#164.1) entries:
 
        Acute Lymphocytic Leukemias
        ---------------------------
        9821/3 LEUKEMIA, LYMPHOID ACUTE, L1 TYPE
        9828/3 LEUKEMIA, LYMPHOID ACUTE, L2 TYPE        (new code)
        9826/3 LEUKEMIA, BURKITT'S CELL
 
        Acute Non-Lymphocytic Leukemias
        -------------------------------
        9872/3 LEUKEMIA, MYELOID ACUTE, MINIMAL DIFF    (new code)
        9873/3 LEUKEMIA, MYELOID ACUTE, W/O MATURATION  (new code)
        9874/3 LEUKEMIA, MYELOID ACUTE, WITH MATURATION (new code)
        9866/3 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC
        9867/3 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOMONOCYTIC
        9871/3 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MYELOMONOCYTIC W EOSINO  (new code)
        9891/3 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE MONOCYTIC
        9840/3 ERYTHROLEUKEMIA
        9910/3 LEUKEMIA, MEGAKARYOCYTIC
 
        These codes are effective with cases diagnosed 1/1/98 or later.

        FOLLOW-UP HISTORY
 
        When displaying the primary list for each "Last contact" date, the
        wrong status was being displayed after each primary.  The LAST
        TUMOR STATUS (#165.5, #95) value was being displayed.  The correct
        status field is the CANCER STATUS (#165.573, #.02) field of the
        TUMOR STATUS multiple (#165.5, #73).  This has been fixed.
