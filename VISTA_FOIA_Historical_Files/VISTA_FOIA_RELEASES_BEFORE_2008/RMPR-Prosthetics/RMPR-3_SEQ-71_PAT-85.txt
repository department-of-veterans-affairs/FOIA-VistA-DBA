Subject: ALLOW CONSULTS TO FORWARD TO TRACKER ONLY, OVERWRITING INITIAL ACTION DATA 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ******************************N O T E************************************
 This patch has *NO* conflict with the COREFLS environment for Prosthetics
 *************************************************************************
      
 During Suspense Processing in Prosthetics, the user cannot forward a 
 consult to a "Tracking Only" Service.  This patch will make the 
 necessary modifications to allow this to happen.
      
 Also, the Initial Action Date, Note and User ID (DUZ) are being
 overwritten when forwarding a consult to another service.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
      
 Problem #1
 -------
 After the installation of RMPR*3*80 it was discovered that during
 suspense processing in Prosthetics that the user could no longer 
 forward consults to a "Tracker Only" service.  This was found to 
 conflict with needed business rules.
      
 The NOIS calls also reflected that they wanted to discontinue the ability
 to forward consults to disabled and grouper services.  This has been 
 addressed in this patch.
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine ^RMPREOS to allow forwarding to
 a "Tracker Only" Service and not allow forwarding to Disabled or
 Grouper services.
      
 **Note 
 The Prosthetics user forwarding the request needs to be set up in the tracker
 service as an ADMIN user in coordination with your local Clinical Applications 
 Coordinator.
 
 Problem #2
 -------
 When forwarding a consult to another service the Initial Action Date, 
 Note and DUZ variable are being overwritten and no longer displaying 
 during suspense processing.
      
 Detail:
 Using the RMPR OFFICIAL MENU
           SU Suspense Menu
           SP Suspense Processing
 The user will use PI Post Initial Action to post a note 
 When the user uses FW Forward a consult to another service
      and then uses VR to view the request 
      the Initial Action Note, Date and DUZ(user data) are gone
      
 Resolution
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to routine RMPREOS to correct the array entries
 so the Initial Notes and their associated data (Date and DUZ) display
 properly.

 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.

     menu, select the Installation menu.
      
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMPR*3.0*85)
      
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     RMPR*3.0*85.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
      
  8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
