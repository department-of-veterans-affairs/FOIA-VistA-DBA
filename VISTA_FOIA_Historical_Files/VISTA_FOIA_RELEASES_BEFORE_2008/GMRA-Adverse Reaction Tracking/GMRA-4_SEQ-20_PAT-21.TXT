Subject: Removal of allergies as orders

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch, along with changes in patch OR*3.0*195 (GUI v25), and patch
 OR*3.0*216, will remove allergies as orders.  Previously, the entry of
 allergy related information was handled as an order through CPRS.  This
 caused a number of problems related to accurate representation of
 allergies for a patient.  In addition, the orders tab and the information
 in the postings area and the cover sheet was often inconsistent due to the
 "one-way" communication between order entry and allergy tracking.
  
 Upon installation of this patch, which must be done at the same time as 
 OR*3.0*216, allergies will no longer be handled as orders.  While 
 you'll still be able to enter allergy information from the orders tab, 
 the allergy itself will not appear as an order on the orders tab.  
  
 The cover sheet in CPRS will now allow for the addition of new allergies
 as well as the ability to mark allergies as entered in error.  You will
 also be able to indicate that a patient has been assessed and has no known
 allergies (NKA).
  
 From the ART package interface, you will now be able to remove an 
 erroneous assessment of No Known Allergies (NKA) for a patient.  When 
 using the enter/edit patient reaction data option, if the patient is 
 currently assessed as NKA, you may now enter the '@' sign at the "does 
 this patient have any known allergies or adverse reactions? :No//" 
 prompt.  The patient's assessment will be returned to 'not assessed'.
  
 Upon installation of this patch, a post-installation routine will be 
 queued to run in the background.  Upon completion, a message will be 
 sent identifying all observed allergies that are missing either the 
 sign/symptoms or the observation date.  This data is now required when 
 entering allergies through the GUI.  In addition, the post-installation 
 will identify all patients who have an IODINE allergy.  The IODINE 
 allergy in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82), which is a nationally 
 released entry, has been updated.  You'll need to review the list of 
 patient names to make sure that the IODINE allergy information on file is 
 correct.
  
 DOCUMENTATION:
 ==============
 An updated ART User Manual (GMRA_4_21_UM.PDF) will be distributed with 
 this patch. This documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
 Again, the preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documents directly
 from a specific server as follows:
   
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov> 
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
   
 This file MUST be obtained in BINARY mode.
   
 The documentation can also be found on the Health System Design and
 Development Web page: (http://vista.med.va.gov/vdl/).
  
 NOIS
 ====
 TUC-0304-60262     Allergy orders not appearing under postings
 LEX-0403-40160     Allergies Not Showing Up
 CON-0902-11414     ACTIVE ALLERGY NOT DISPLAYED ON COVER SHEET
 SAG-1101-40858     ALLERGY INFO INCORRECT
 WPB-1101-30375     Ability to discontinue allergy (orders)
 BED-0901-11728     Allergy orders cannot be cleaned up

 BAY-0599-31108     Allergy Entry Shows Provider as Originator
 PUG-0598-52397     DC/Remove ART Order from CPRS
  
 All of the above NOIS deal with issues related to allergies as orders.  
 For the most part, the problem is that the "order" for the allergy is not 
 removed from the orders tab when the allergy is marked entered in error 
 from the ART package.  As allergies will no longer be treated as orders 
 the removal of the order from the orders tab is no longer required.
  
 BIL-0600-31240     GMRAOR ALLERGY ENTER/EDIT
 CTX-0999-70580     Unable to create quick order for NKA
 BRX-0404-10531     undefined variable ORNP
  
 Previously, there were problems when a user attempted to add a quick 
 order for an allergy.  With allergies no longer being treated as orders, 
 quick orders are no longer an issue as they are no longer possible.
  
 CLA-1099-22800     NEW ALLERGY - CAUSATIVE AGENT SCROLLS OFF SCREEN
  
 When using the list manager version of CPRS to add an allergy, it was 
 possible to have the list of choices scroll off the screen so that the 
 choices near the top were no longer visible.  Listmanager now calls the 
 allergy package directly for adding allergies so this is no longer a 
 problem.
  
 BOI-1103-51156     Allergy order entry not locked in CPRS and Vista
  
 Prior to this patch it was possible for more than one user to be entering 
 allergy information on the same patient.  Locks have now been put in 
 place so that only one person at a time may add/edit allergy data for a
 patient
  
 HIN-0700-41218     allergy severity
  
 Previously, an observation date wasn't required when entering an observed 
 reaction through the GUI interface.  As a result, any observed reaction 
 without an observation date was not having its observation related data 
 stored (this includes the severity).  As a result, the severity never 
 displayed with the detailed listing for the allergy.  With this patch, 
 the observation date is now required.  In addition, the post-installation 
 routine will identify any observed reactions that do not have an 
 observation date so they may be updated. 
  
 HUN-0898-20436     NOT PROMPT FOR MECHANISM FOR ALLERGIES
  
 When entering an allergy via the GUI interface, the user is not prompted 
 for the mechanism.  The GUI interface will now prompt for mechanism.
  
 WNY-0398-10655     DC/Remove ART Order from CPRS
  
 In the GUI interface, users are allowed to enter duplicate entries 
 without warning.  With this patch, when a user attempts to add an allergy 
 that is already on record, they'll be alerted to the fact that this is a 
 duplicate and the duplicate entry will not be saved.
  
 MAR-0704-20507     PROBLEM FOUND AFTER INSTALL ON PATCH 19
  
 When verifying multiple reactions, if a user marks one of the entries as 
 entered in error and a progress note is not filed for this entry then the 
 user is exited from the option even though they may have more entries to 
 review.  The variable that controls whether the user has requested to 
 exit the option was not being protected when the user is questioned about 
 entering the progress note. This has now been fixed so that the user is 
 not exited when marking an entry as entered in error.
  
 TUC-0704-61910     [GMRA PRINT A/AR NV] error
 LOU-0704-41111     <NULLSUBSCR>FIND+14^GMRAPU:1 Error
 BRX-0704-10527     NULL SUBSCR ERROR
 SBY-0604-31758     ERROR - FIND+14^GMRAPU
  
 After the release of patch GMRA*4*19, some sites experienced an error 
 when trying to run verification reports.  The error came as a result of 
 bad data nodes in the patient allergies file.  The problem that causes 
 these bad nodes is fixed in CPRS GUI v24 and the existing bad nodes were 
 deleted in patch GMRA*4*17.  However, some sites have had bad data added 
 between the time patch 17 was released and the release of GUI v24.  The 
 post-install routine GMRAY21 will remove the bad data nodes.
  
 WRJ-0704-11898     ALLERGY ORDER CHECK NOT HAPPENING WITH DRUG ORDER
 PSI-04-041
  
 When selecting IODINE as a causative agent, it was possible that the 
 entry from the GMR ALLERGIES file could be erroneously assigned as the 
 agent even if the user selected IODINE from a different file.  This was 
 due to the logic used to resolve the agent selected.  IODINE is the only 
 entry in the GMR ALLERGIES file that matched exactly with another entry 
 from one of the other files.  The problem is resolved by the changes to 
 the allergy package removing them as orders.  However, a clean up of 
 potentially incorrect entries is required.  A list of patients who had 
 their IODINE reaction updated is provided in the post-install message.  
 Sites should review the patients' reactions for accuracy.

 14914 - Make mechanism available through the GUI interface.
 With the installation of patches OR*3*195, OR*3*216, and GMRA*4*21, the 
 new allergy dialog will now prompt for the mechanism.

 INSTALLATION
 ============
 **NOTE** You must install patch OR*3.0*216 before installing this patch 
 and they must be installed consecutively!  Users should be off the 
 system when these patches are installed.  Failure to do so may result in
 errors or missed allergy entries.
  
 **NOTE** The changes that are included in GUI v25 will not become active 
 until patch OR*3*216 and patch GMRA*4*21 are installed.  You will 
 probably want to install all three patches at the same time.
  
 Installation time should be less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*21):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRA*4.0*21.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     you may respond YES.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
