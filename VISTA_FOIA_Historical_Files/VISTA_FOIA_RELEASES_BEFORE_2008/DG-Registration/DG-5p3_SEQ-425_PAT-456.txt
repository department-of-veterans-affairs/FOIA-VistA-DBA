 OVERVIEW
 ========
  
 On January 23, 2002, President Bush signed Public Law 107-135, The 
 Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 
 2001.  Section 202 of this Act requires the implementation of HUD indices 
 to determine geographic income thresholds in support of more discrete 
 means testing.  Veterans in Priority Group 7 are eligible for treatment 
 as a low-income family under section 3(b) of the United States Housing 
 Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)) for the area in which such veterans 
 reside, regardless of whether such veterans are treated as single person 
 families under paragraph (3)(A) of such section 3(b) or as families under 
 paragraph (3)(b).  This Act also established   Priority Group 8 for any 
 veterans described in section 1710(a)(3) of titles 38 U.S.C. who are not 
 covered by Priority Group 7.
  
 The Geographic Means Testing project introduces enhancements to the VistA 
 and HEC Legacy systems to support the requirements of the new 
 regulation.  These enhancements consist of the following:
  
 1. The storage of the HUD indices and utilization of the HUD indices to 
 determine the GMT Threshold based on the veteran's address.
  
 2. Zip code linking so that the entry of the zip code in the veteran's 
 address automatically populates the city, state and county fields. 
  
 3. The creation of a new means test status, GMT Copay Required, and the 
 calculations needed to assign this new status based on the GMT Threshold.
  
 4. The means test status, Category A, has been changed to MT Copay 
 Exempt, and the means test status, Category C, has been changed to MT 
 Copay Required.
  
 5. The creation of the new Priority Group 8 and the modifications to the 
 logic for determining a veteran's enrollment priority.  The changes 
 include the new rules for assigning Priority Group 7 and 8.
  
 6. Modifications to HL7 messages to accommodate the transmission of new 
 data fields between the VAMCs and the HEC.
  
 For a detailed description of the functionality included in this project, 
 please refer to the Geographic Means Testing and Address Indexing for GMT 
 Software Requirements Specification documents.  These documents can be 
 found on the web page for the Geographic Means Testing Project Notebook.

 The enhancements are being distributed in several patches that will be 
 installed in four phases as outlined below:

 The software for this patch, DG*5.3*456, and associated patches, are not 
 being distributed through the National Patch Module.  These patches are 
 being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file).  
 This patch contains the informational portion of DG*5.3*456 and provides 
 field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install, and 
 implement the patch software.
  
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
  
 1. Modifications to the Means Test Status file (#408.32) to change the 
 name of means test status CATEGORY A to MT COPAY EXEMPT and CATEGORY C to 
 MT COPAY REQUIRED.
  
 2. Modifications to the means test process to calculate a veteran's GMT 
 Threshold and assign a status of GMT Copay Required if the veteran's net 
 income is above the MT Threshold but below the GMT Threshold.
  
 3. Modifications to the means test options to display the GMT Threshold 
 and change all occurrences of Category A to MT Copay Exempt and Category 
 C to MT Copay Required.
  
 4. Modifications to the hardship options to add the Hardship Reason 
 field, allow a hardship to be granted to a veteran with a status of GMT 
 Copay Required, and to prompt the user to select a hardship status, 
 either MT Copay Exempt or GMT Copay Required. 
  
 5. Modifications to the process for determining a veteran's enrollment 
 priority involving changes to the rules for assigning Priority Group 7 
 and Priority Group 8.
  
 6. The addition of a new API to be used by Billing to determine if a 
 veteran had a means test status of GMT Copay Required on a specified date.
  
 7. Modifications to the following reports to include the new enrollment 
 priority group 8:
  
          Enrolled Veterans Report
