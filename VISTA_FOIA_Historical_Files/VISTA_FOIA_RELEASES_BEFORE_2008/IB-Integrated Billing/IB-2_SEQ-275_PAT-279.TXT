  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1. ISP-0404-N2085    Unable to edit the Provider ID only.
    
     Problem:
     --------
     It has been discovered that some of the CARE UNIT (#.03) field 
     pointers in the IB BILLING PRACTITIONER ID (#355.9) and the IB
     INSURANCE CO LEVEL BILLING PROV ID (#355.91) files were not being
     updated properly when editing an id record.  If the user modified the
     selections in such a way that the existing Care Unit was still valid
     for the combination chosen, the software did not update the pointer to
     the correct Care Unit combination in the IB INS CO PROVIDER ID CARE
     UNIT (#355.96) file.  The cause of this issue was corrected by patch
     IB*2.0*232 (EDI/HIPAA ENHANCEMENTS).  But, if any invalid Care Unit
     combination pointers already existed, in the above mentioned files,
     they were not corrected.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The pre-init routine, IB20P279, will search files 355.9 and 355.91 for
     invalid Care Unit pointers (field .03) and correct them.  If any of 
     the pointers can not be updated, a mailman message will be sent to the
     user and the IB EDI SUPERVISOR mail group with instructions to delete
     or modify the entry.  If any part of the mail message fails, the
     report will display in the installation as well.  The mailman message
     will look like the following:
    
 Subj: PROVIDER ID CARE UNIT POINTERS INVALID [#249168] 07/21/04@11:15 35 
 lines
 From: PATCH IB*2.0*279 PRE-INIT  In 'IB*2*279' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This message has been sent by patch IB*2.0*279 at the completion of
 the pre-init routine.
    
 The Care Unit pointer values could not be corrected automatically for the
 following Provider ID entries.  These entries need to be deleted or 
 modified by choosing INSURANCE CO IDS from the Provider ID Maintenance
 [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] menu option.  If there is only one entry with the
 combination selected, then choose Edit an ID Record and accept all the
 defaults.  The Care Unit combination pointer will be corrected.  If there
 are two (2) identical entries, and you are unable to determine which one
 needs to be corrected, then delete both entries and then re-enter the
 data.  If you are able to distinguish which entry is the invalid one, then
 you can either edit the Care Unit to a new one which does not create a
 duplicate combination or you may delete it.  It is important that the
 invalid entry NOT be left unchanged on the system.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
  the system.  Installation time will be less than 2 minutes.
    
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
    
  2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]:
    
            Edits and Distribution ...
            Utilities ...
            Installation ...
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                               ---
    
      1      Load a Distribution
      2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
      3      Print Transport Global
      4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
      5      Backup a Transport Global
      6      Install Package(s)
             Restart Install of Package(s)
             Unload a Distribution
    
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter IB*2.0*279):
    
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
    
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package IB*2.0*279.
    
      a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//', answer NO.
      b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
          Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer NO.
    
  5.  Do NOT delete the pre-init routine, IB20P279, until you have
      completed the post-install instructions.
    
    
  POST-INSTALL
  ============
  1. IRM - Review the installation messages.  If there were no invalid
     pointers found or all invalid pointers were corrected during the
     installation, then no Mailman message will have been sent, and you
     can skip to step 4. Otherwise, make sure the appropriate 
      personnel in Billing have received the Mailman message. 
    
  2.  Billing - Follow the instructions in the mailman message to correct
      any entries with invalid Care Unit pointers.
    
  3.  After all the entries listed in the Mailman message have been
      corrected, check to insure the Care Unit pointers are correct.
      This can be accomplished by running the pre-init routine from the
      programmers prompt by typing "D PROVID^IB20P279".  If there are no
      reported invalid Care Unit pointers, then you are done.  If there
      are still invalid Care Unit pointers, repeat post-install steps
      1 thru 3.
    
  4.  After all the invalid Care Unit pointer entries have been corrected,
      you may delete the pre-init routine, IB20P279, from the system.
