Description:
============

 ******************************N O T E************************************
 This patch has *NO* conflict with the COREFLS environment for Controlled
 Substances
 *************************************************************************
      
 A request was made to modify the prompting in option PSD STOCK DRUG EDIT 
 Stock CS Drugs - Enter/Edit for Patch PSD*3*44.
 After the patch was released the sites did not agree with
 the new functionality.  This patch will return the original functionality of
 the PSD STOCK DRUG EDIT Stock CS Drugs - Enter/Edit option to a state  
 prior to Patch PSD*3*44.
      
 Problem
 -------
 After Patch PSD*3*44 is installed, the prompts for this option are not 
 what the sites are expecting.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================
      
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not need to be off
 the system.  Install time will be less than 2 minutes.
      
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
     TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
     patch text only].
      
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
     the mapped set at this time.
      
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)

  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSD*3*47)
      
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     PSD*3*47.
      
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO
      
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
      
  8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
