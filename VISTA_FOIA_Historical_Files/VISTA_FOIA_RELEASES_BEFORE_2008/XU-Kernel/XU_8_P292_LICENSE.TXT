IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOTPERMITTED TO USE National ZIP+4 Address Database, AND YOU MUST IMMEDIATELYDELETE ALL DOWNLOADED FILES OF National ZIP+4 Address Database FROM YOURCOMPUTER(S) AND/OR PROMPTLY RETURN THE National ZIP+4 Address DatabaseMEDIA TO CD LIGHT FOR A REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.The invoice issued to you by CD Light when you purchased National ZIP+4Address Database indicates which of the following licenses governs your useof National ZIP+4 Address Database. This document contains all threelicenses offered by CD Light for National ZIP+4 Address Database. However,only the license(s) indentified by the invoice is(are) applicable.License OverviewCD Light offers two primary licenses and a license addendum for each of itsdatabase products: an enterprise (multi-user, multi-site) license, aworkstation (single-user) license, and a duplication license addendum. Theinvoice issued to you by CD Light when you purchased National ZIP+4 AddressDatabase indicates which of these licenses governs your use of NationalZIP+4 Address Database. Please contact CD Light immediately if the licenseindicated on your CD Light invoice does not match the way you intend to useNational ZIP+4 Address Database.The enterprise license is the standard user license for all CD Lightdatabase products. It provides for unlimited use of any one CD Lightdatabase product within your organization. You can copy and install thedatabase on as many computers or networks as you wish at as many sites asyou wish within your organization. The enterprise license permits anunlimited number of users within your organization to access the databasesimultaneously. If you incorporate some or all of the database into aprogram which is used internally by people within your organization, thenyou need the enterprise license. Likewise, if you want to incorporate thedatabase into a product which is accessed via the Internet, then you needthe enterprise license. The enterprise license does not, by itself, grantyou a license to sell the CD Light database itself nor any part of it whichyou may have incorporated into your products. For that you must also havethe duplication license addendum, described below.The workstation (single-user) license is a lower-cost, restricted-uselicense intended for those situations where the database is installed ononly a single machine, at one site, and never accessed by more than oneuser under any circumstances. Typically, this is a non-networked personalcomputer which does not share data or storage with other computers orusers. The workstation license does NOT permit you to access the databaseitself or a program incorporating some or all of the database over anetwork or the Internet. For that you need the enterprise license.Moreover, if you want to incorporate the database into a product which youintend to distribute to other people, you must also have the duplicationlicense addendum, described below.The duplication license addendum permits either limited or unlimitedcommercial and/or non-profit distribution of products which incorporatesome or all of a CD Light database product. The duplication license is anadd-on license; you must first purchase either a workstation license (inthe case of a single development workstation) or an enterprise license (inthe case of installation on multiple computers or access by multiple users)for the database you plan to distribute. The duplication license appliesonly to the CD Light database identified by the associated workstation orenterprise license, and only to the one version or annual subscriptioncovered by that license. In other words, you are permitted to duplicatedata received now or under a current subscription. But in the future if youwish to purchase an additional update or annual subscription, you must alsopurchase a duplication license at that time to cover the data delivered toyou under that workstation or enterprise license agreement. If you do notpurchase a duplication license for the new database delivered under a newworkstation or enterprise license, you are not permitted to duplicate thenew database.Note that the duplication license addendum permits you to incorporate someor all of a CD Light database into a product for distribution (which wecall a derivative product), but prohibits the distribution of the rawdatabase data itself. You must add some value to the database byincorporating it into another product in order to qualify for theduplication license. We cannot and will not permit you to distribute ourdatabase products in direct competition with us.Licensing ExamplesHere are a few examples of real-life licensing situations which may helpyou understand our intent with regard to the licensing of our databaseproducts.Example 1. You want to incorporate a CD Light database product into an in-house order-entry program which verifies the city-state-zip code forcallers placing orders for your products. The order-entry program is usedby ten telephone operators. You would need the enterprise license because the database will be accessedby up to ten simultaneous users within your company, as well as by yourprogrammers on their development machines.Example 2. You are a one-man shop developing a dealer-locator program whichyou wish to sell to the web masters of web sites around the USA. You planto extract the latitude and longitude information from a CD Light databaseto use in calculating the distance between ZIP codes. You plan to demo yourdealer locator on your own web site. You would need both the enterprise license and the duplication licenseaddendum. You need the enterprise license because you will be using thedata extracted from the CD Light database in a program accessible tomultiple users via the Internet. And you need the duplication licenseaddendum because you will be selling portions of the CD Light database tothird parties as a part of your product.Example 3. You want to use a CD Light database as a reference source tocorrect the area codes of customer records in your customer database. Alldatabase area code update work will be performed on a single workstation,and your customer database is maintained on a server. Your updated customerdatabase will be available to users throughout your company.You need only the workstation (single-user) license. The CD Light databaseitself will be installed on a single workstation and will NOT be directlyor indirectly accessed by users in your company.Example 4. You want to develop an application for multi-user in-house usewhich you may decide later to sell as a product. Your application wouldincorporate data extracted from a CD Light database.Initially, you might purchase a workstation (single-user) license fordatabase use on a single development machine. This would be sufficientduring the development phase of a project. But because the finalapplication is to be used by many people, you would eventually need toupgrade to an enterprise license. Later, if you decide to sell the productto others, you would need to add the duplication license.If you have any questions about licensing of CD Light databases, pleasecontact us at sales@zipinfo.com or call us at 800-571-3914.****************************************************************National ZIP+4 Address Database End-User Enterprise License AgreementLICENSE AGREEMENTPlease read this License Agreement before using National ZIP+4 AddressDatabase.
