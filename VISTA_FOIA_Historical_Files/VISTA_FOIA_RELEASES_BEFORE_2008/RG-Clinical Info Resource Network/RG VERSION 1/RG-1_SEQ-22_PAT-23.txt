  - Routine

Description: 
============

  DG*5.3*414, RG*1.0*17, RG*1.0*19, and RG*1.0*21 are required builds
  for patch RG*1*23.
   
  RG*1.0*23 should be installed immediately after DG*5.3*414.
   
  This patch includes enhancements that are proposed in the Master
  Patient Index / Patient Demographics, Phase III Enhancements, Software
  Design Document.
   
  1.)  The Remote Patient Data Query Menu [RG REMOTE PDAT MENU] has
  been added to the Message Exception Menu [RG EXCEPTION MENU], which
  is on the MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].
   
  This menu provides options to query any facility at which a selected
  patient has been seen, check the query, and display the remote patient
  data that is returned from that site.  The remote data fields retrieved
  are the same as those that are currently available for local data using
  the Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option.
   
  Additionally, this same functionality has been incorporated into the
  MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option.
   
  NOTE:  The remote patient data query options will retrieve data
         only from those facilities that have installed DG*5.3*414
         and RG*1.0*23 and that have correctly set up the host
         file server device as directed in DG*5.3*414.
   
  2.)  NOIS MAN-1001-12698 reported a problem with the list manager
  screen display within the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION
  HANDLING] option.  On the second page of the first screen, the
  View Selected Exception Type was chosen and a specific exception
  type was selected.  The new sorted list was displayed beginning
  on the second page.  A change in routine RGEXHND1 was made so that 
  the sort always goes to the first page.
   
  3.)  The Compile MPI/PD HL7 Data [RGMT DIAG COMPILE HL7 DATA] option
  has been refined in routine RGMTHL2 to extract additional HL7
  messaging status information during the compile process.  The data
  is displayed by the MPI/PD HL7 Message Status Report [RGMT DIAG STATUS
  REPORT] option.  This is part of the diagnostic tool used by
  National Vista Support (NVS) and the Master Patient Index/Patient
  Demographics (MPI/PD) development team.
   
  4.)  A new field, LOCAL/MISSING DATE LAST RAN (#.04), has been added
  to the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file.  When a later MASTER PATIENT
  INDEX VISTA patch is released (most likely MPIF*1.0*21), the new field
  will be populated when the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job
  [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] runs to completion.
   
  If the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN
  RES] is scheduled to run, and if there is data in the LOCAL/MISSING
  DATE LAST RAN (#.04) field, this information will be provided on the
  MPI/PD Status Display [RG STATUS DISPLAY] option.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
  or subscribers.
     
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  A new field has been added to the EXCEPTION (#2) field multiple of
  the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file.  The NOTES (#11) field
  allows users to enter notes regarding an exception to aid in
  resolving the exception.
   
  A new field, LOCAL/MISSING DATE LAST RAN (#.04), has been added to
  the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file.  The LOCAL/MISSING DATE LAST
  RAN (#.04) field contains the date and time that the Local/Missing
  ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] last ran to
  completion.
   
  New Options:
  ============
  Four new options are exported in this patch.
  1.) Remote Patient Data Query Menu [RG REMOTE PDAT MENU]
  This menu provides options to query any facility at which a selected
  patient has been seen, check the query, and display the remote patient
  data that is returned from that site.  The remote data fields retrieved
  include the Integration Control Number (ICN), the Coordinating Master
  of Record (CMOR) site, MPI/PD Activity Score, Subscription Control
  Number, Treating Facility list, CMOR History and CMOR Change Request
  History.
  2.) Send Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT SEND]
  This option allows you to send remote patient data queries from your
  facility to any facility at which a selected patient has been seen. 
  The remote data fields retrieved are the same as those that are
  available for local data using the Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry
  [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option.  
  3.) Check Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT CHECK]
  This option allows you to check the status of a remote patient
  data query previously sent using the Send Remote Patient Data Query
  [RG REMOTE PDAT SEND] option.
  4.) Display Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY]
  This option allows you to display a patient data query previously
  sent using the Send Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT SEND]
  option.
   
  Protocols:
  ==========
  The following new protocols are included to support MPI/PD Exception 
  Handling.
  RG EXCPT EDIT NOTE
  RG EXCPT MPI/PD DATA
  RG EXCPT PDAT MENU
  RG EXCPT RCHK
  RG EXCPT RDISP
  RG EXCPT RSEND
   
  The protocol RG EXCPT TF INQUIRY has been deleted.  The functionality
  provided by this protocol is replaced by the new protocol RG EXCPT
  MPI/PD DATA.
   
  List Templates:
  ===============
  Two list templates are distributed with RG*1*23 to support remote
  data query.
  RG EXCPT PDAT
  RG EXCPT RPDAT
     
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following documentation files are exported as part of this patch.
  These manuals have been completely revised to reflect the changes in
  RG*1*23.
   
      RG1_0_UM.PDF     Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
                       (MPI/PD) User Manual
      RG1_0_TM.PDF     Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics
                       (MPI/PD) Technical Manual
   
  The files can be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is to
  get the files from:  download.vista.med.va.gov.
  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
