Description:
============

 This patch contains the following items:
  
 1. This patch updates the tickler file options as described below. The
 DIETITIAN TICKLER FILE (#119) allows the user to receive notifications
 that act as reminders for you to take some action.  In the current manual
 process a tickler file entry can be made two ways:  1) when entering a
 Nutrition Location, the parameters contain a field that holds the number
 of days for the notification concerning the review of supplemental 
 feedings or review notes based on patient nutrition status level; and (2)
 the file can also be accessed via the Tickler File [FHCTF] menu option.
   
 Through the enhancement, the file would be automated to provide alert
 notification to the user if they desire.  Performance monitors that
 are needed to improve patient safety and monitoring while adhering to
 guidelines provided by quality management are updated.  Monitor values for
 BMI have been changed from <21 to <18.5.  Monitor values for Albumin have
 been changed from <3.2 gm/dl from <2.8 gm/dl.  Also, elimination of the
 duplicate tickler file entries for each patient and allowing the current
 entries to follow the patient when they are transferred to another unit,
 will eliminate the extra work currently being performed to duplicate that
 tickler file entry for each area.  The following bullets summarize each
 area of change:
   
 Functionality
 =============
   
 a) Provide ability for use of alerts as the notification method for
 monitors.  The Enter/Edit Nutrition Locations [FHPRO2] option may be
 used to set up alerts for the different monitor types, by setting the
 alert fields to YES.  The clinician entered for that location will receive
 the alerts.  Additionally, other individuals who may need to receive the
 alerts may be added in the "Also Send Alerts to" multiple field.
  
 Example:
   
 Select OPTION NAME: Enter/Edit Nutrition Locations  [FHPRO2]
  
 Select WARD or OUTPATIENT Location: Ward Location
  
 Select NUTRITION LOCATION NAME: 4AS    
 NAME: 4AS//

        N        NO

      Do you want to be alerted for Albumin value for this location?

      Choose from: 
        Y        YES
        N        NO
  
 Select ALSO SEND ALERTS TO: NURSE,TEST   <--- Add others who will 
 receive alerts 
  
 Are you adding 'NURSE,TEST' as a new  ALSO SEND ALERTS TO (the 1ST for 
 this NUTRITION LOCATION)? No// Y  (Yes)
  
 Select ALSO SEND ALERTS TO:   
  
 b) The routine FHCTF5 has been modified to change the monitor value of BMI
 from the previous value of <21 to <18.5 with the timeframe to include
 the present admission or with in 7 days back for creating a new monitor,
 and 30 days later for a subsequent monitor. This change will be reflected
 in the selection of the patients that meet this criteria via a tasked job,
 INPATIENT MONITOR SCAN [FHCTF5].
  
 c) The routine FHCTF5 has been modified to change the monitor value of 
 Albumin from the previous value of <3.2 to <2.8 gm/dl with the timeframe
 to include the present admission or with in 7 days prior to the admission 
 for new monitors. This change will be reflected in the selection of the
 patients that meet this criteria via a tasked job, INPATIENT MONITOR SCAN
 [FHCTF5].
  
 d) Sites may access the Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu and use the
 option Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] (please see your IRM
 Support Person) or manually modify the Inpatient Monitor Scan [FHCTF5]
 option to run twice daily to update criteria more than once a day.  To
 accomplish this, sites should use VA Fileman [DIUSER] to change the
 RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY (#19.2,6) field in the OPTION SCHEDULING (#119.2)
 file to "12H" (every 12 hours) for the Inpatient Monitor Scan [FHCTF5]
 option.  Below is an example:
  
    Select OPTION: 1    ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES [DIEDIT]
    
    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: OPTION SCHEDULING (#19.2)// 
    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY (#19.2,6)  
    THEN EDIT FIELD: 
    
    Select OPTION SCHEDULING NAME: INPATIENT MONITOR SCAN [FHCTF5]
    RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY: 12H
    
 e) The routine FHWTRN has been modified to better utilize the DIETITIAN
 TICKLER FILE (#119) so that the Tickler file entry for that admission is 
 used when the patient is transferred to another unit.  Previously, a
 new tickler was created when a patient was transferred to another unit,
 resulting in multiple entries.
    
 f) The option, Display Tickler File [FHCTF1], has been modified so that
 there is only one tickler for the same patient in the display list and 
 it displays in alphabetical order by clinician and patient, and by date.
 Previously, each tickler file entry resulted in repeated displays of the 
 patient name.
  
 g) Personalized Ticklers could previously be entered but were not being   
 displayed to the user in a useful format or being cleared in a timely
 manner. This has been changed so that Personalized Ticklers are now
 displayed using the option Display Tickler File [FHCTF1], and outdated 
 personalized ticklers will be cleared automatically.
  
  
 h) The option, Clear Tickler File Entries [FHCTF2], has been modified so
 ticklers can be cleared individually, through a series of numbers or 
 all at once.  Previously a user could only clear one tickler at a time.
  
 i) The report option, Nutrition Monitor Statistics Report [FHMNREP], has 
 been modified internally to reflect the change in BMI and Albumin 
 monitor values.  The header summary for each location has been generalized
 because historical data on previous monitors will not be converted and old
 as well as new values can be viewed.
  
 j) The report option, List Ward Assignments [FHORC6], has been modified to
 add a column "ALSO SEND ALERTS TO" and the corresponding users for
 each Nutrition Location.
  
 2. This patch replaces all direct global reads of Pharmacy Files and 
 replaces them with Pharmacy API's provided by the Pharmacy Re-engineering
 team.  The options affected by these changes are the Inpatient Monitor
 Scan and the Nutritional Assessment options.  These changes are all
 transparent to the user and will allow these options to look and work
 exactly as they did prior to this patch.
  
 3. This patch fixes a problem in which M-code was incorrectly displaying 
 under the Lab Data section of the Nutritional Assessments [FHASM1] 
 option.  Direct global reads of lab files resulted in incorrect reference
 ranges, so they have been replaced by calls to Lab API's.
    
 4. This patch allows the ability to enter/edit the ROOM-BED (#2) and
 SUPP. FDG. SITE (#7) fields of the Nutrition Location (#119.6) file for
 Outpatient Locations using the Enter/Edit Nutrition Locations [FHPRO2]
 option.  These changes will be necessary for a future patch.
