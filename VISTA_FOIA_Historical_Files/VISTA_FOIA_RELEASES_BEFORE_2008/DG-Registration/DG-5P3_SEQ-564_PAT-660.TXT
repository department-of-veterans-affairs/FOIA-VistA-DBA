Description:
============

 The following statement was omitted from the Installation Instructions
 in patch ICD*18*14 released February 8, 2005:
  
     Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs option in order to make the transfer DRGs
     correspond to the appropriate grouper.
  
     This should be done soon after installing the patch, but should 
     be run at a time when PTF options are not in use.
     
     This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records
     opened during the current fiscal year (since 10/1/2004).
     
     The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
     is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
     current FY.
