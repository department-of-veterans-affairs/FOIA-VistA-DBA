Subject: Taskman Schedule leap year fix

 DESCRIPTION
 ===========
  
  Patch XU*8*141
  
 This patch may be installed at anytime, except during the 2/28/2000 thru
 3/3/2000 Leap Year Lockdown.
  
 While investigating NOIS DAY-0200-40034, a leap year problem was found in
 SCH^XLFDT that affects tasks scheduled for the last day of the month.
 Taskman uses this routine to evaluate the RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY field in 
 the Option Scheduling file.
  
 This patch also fixes a looping problem which occurs if the
 schedule requests a day beyond the end of the month (i.e. the 30th of
 each month for February or the 31st of April).  After the patch, it will
 now default to the end of the month. This would make a schedule of
 "1M(30@2200)" for February be evaluated as "1M(l@2200)".
  
 Sites should use the following to see if any tasks are affected by evaluating
 the QUEUED TO RUN AT WHAT TIME field to see if it is appropriate for the
 task. Look for task that should have been scheduled for Feb 29,2000.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
   1.  Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
   2.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
      
   3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
   4.  You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the Background Filers.
  
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
       
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
      
   Note:  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
      
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*141'
                              ==========
                              
         No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                         ==
