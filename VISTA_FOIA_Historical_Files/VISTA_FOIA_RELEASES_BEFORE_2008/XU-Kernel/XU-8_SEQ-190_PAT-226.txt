Subject: API TO RETURN DEFAULT DIVISION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 NOIS: PBG-0102-N2960
 Test Sites:PALM BEACH GARDENS, FL
  
 This patch modifies $$DIV4^XUSER(.RES,USER) to return a DEFAULT division
 in the New Person file.
  
 DSS, Inc has the national contract for the Dental Record Manager (DRM), a 
 Graphic User Interface (GUI) front end to the VistA Dental package. The 
 original and main functionality of DRM was to provide a single interface
 for dental providers to enter Patient Care Encounter (PCE) data, check out
 appointments, do progress notes, file data to the old VistA Dental 
 Automated Medical Information System (AMIS). To file data to dental AMIS,
 the provider needs to indicate which division it is for. The old VistA
 dental package has its own division file. In GUI, radio buttons are
 provided for users to indicate which division. Currently they are left
 blank and users must indicate which one.
  
 Users are requesting that a default division be set, but still allow the
 field to change it. The default division for the users will be pulled from
 the NEW PERSON (#200) file's DIVISION (#16) multiple especially since Data
 Dictionary for the multiple field prevents the entering of more than one
 default.
