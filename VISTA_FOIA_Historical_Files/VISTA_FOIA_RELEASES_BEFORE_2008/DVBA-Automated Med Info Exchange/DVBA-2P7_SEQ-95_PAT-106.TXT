Subject: CAPRI TEMPLATE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
  
  
 The goal of the Compensation and Record Interchange (CAPRI) Compensation 
 and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) project is to implement the current
 Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) compensation and pension
 exam worksheets in an electronic format that will upload exam results into
 Text Integration Utility (TIU) and make the results visible to
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) users.
  
 CPWM is a component of the currently deployed CAPRI Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) application, version DVBA*2.7*91.  This CAPRI GUI
 version should be installed on the desktops of anyone involved in
 the C&P process - from the examiners actually performing the C&P
 exams to the administrative clerk who coordinates the exam processing.
 Please refer to the user guide for further information on CAPRI CPWM.
  
 No new functionality is being provided with this patch.  This patch 
 addresses template content redesign and defect corrections to the C&P 
 examination templates accessible through CAPRI CPWM.
