 Installation Instructions: 
 =========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.
 Installation of this patch should take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following
     options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*191):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global 
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*191.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES, and DISABLE the TIU* Options and
     Protocols.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//', respond '0'.
  
 8.  At the prompt, 'Select TIU DOCUMENT CLASS name:', enter the location 
     where the new note title will be added.  A DOCUMENT CLASS must be 
     selected at this time or enter '^' to abort.
  
     The following error messages may be encountered:
 
     Message:  "Class owner cannot be defined."
       Cause:  The CLINICAL COORDINATOR class cannot be found.  Verify the 
               entry in the USR CLASS (#8930) file.  Reload and reinstall
               TIU*1.0*191 again once the class has been added or fixed.
  
     Message:  "DISCLOSURE OF ADVERSE EVENT NOTE already exists."
       Cause:  The note title already exists in File #8925.1.  If this is
               not the national note title, rename the note title and 
               reinstall TIU*1.0*191.
  
 9.  If no error messages were encountered, the note title should be pre-
     sent in the document definition hierarchy.
 
     Using the Document Definitions (Manager) from the TIU MAINTENANCE MENU,
     test the boilerplate text of the DISCLOSURE OF ADVERSE EVENT NOTE and
     activate the note title (this may need to be done by your Clinical 
     Applications Coordinator).
  
     The new note title should now be ready for use.
