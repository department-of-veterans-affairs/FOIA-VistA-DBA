Subject: FIX FALSE ALERTS AND QUEUE PROCESSOR NOT STARTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 BEFORE INSTALLING THIS PATCH.
  
  
 DESCRIPTION:
 ============
  
 This patch fixes 4 problems in the VistA Data Extraction Framework
 (VDEF) V1.0 functionality:
  
  1) Adds the name of the Request Queue to the VDEF Alert message.
  
  2) Eliminates false VDEF Alerts.
  
  3) Eliminates the problem of VDEF Request Queue processor not being
     restarted by TaskMan.
  
  4) No longer sets the flag for unread VDEF Alerts to be sent to a mail
     group supervisor.
  
 This patch also includes numerous enhancements to the VistA Data
 Extraction Framework (VDEF) functionality:
  
  1) In the VDEF Configuration and Status Menu [VDEF CONFIGURATION MENU],
     the options marked below with an asterisk now return to the option
     prompt instead of going back to the main VDEF Configuration and Status
     Menu.
  
       Site   Site-Wide Parameters
     * Req    Request Queue Parameters
     * ActR   Activate/Inactivate Requestor
     * SusR   Suspend/Run Request Queue
     * Cust   VDEF Custodial Package Activate/Inactivate
     * API    VDEF Event API Activate/Inactivate
       Stat   Status of VDEF components
     * Sch    Request Processor Schedule
  
  2) A new process, the "VDEF Request Queue Monitor  has been added to
     monitor the VDEF Request Queue process and restart it when it stops
     if the state of the Request Queue is Running. This new monitor is
     automatically started by the VDEF Startup option. This process is
     hardcoded to run every 10 minutes. The VDEF Request Queue Monitor will
     also automatically requeue any Checked Out and Errored Out VDEF
     requests.
  
  3) VDEF Alert messages are now prefixed with the date & time of the
     alert in the format MM/DD/YY@HH:MM:SS.
  
  4) Original VDEF Alert message texts are clearer in context.
  
  5) New VDEF Alerts have been added.
     - VDEF CHECKED OUT MONITOR FAILED TO START. CHECK ERROR TRAP.
     - RECORD <IEN> IN QUEUE <QUEUE NAME> HUNG IN CHECKED OUT STATUS.
     - VDEF REQUEST PROCESS <QUEUE NAME> FAILED TO START. CHECK ERROR
       TRAP.
     - VDEF QUEUE PROCESS MONITOR DID NOT START. CHECK ERROR TRAP.
     - VDEF HAS REQUEUED CHECKED OUT RECORDS. NO ACTION NEEDED.
     - VDEF HAS REQUEUED ERRORED OUT RECORDS. NO ACTION NEEDED.
     - VDEF QUEUE PROCESS MONITOR HAS EXITED.
     - VDEF QUEUE '"_QUEUE_"' AUTO-RESTARTED. NO ACTION REQUIRED.
     - VDEF QUEUE '"_QUEUE_"' IS SUSPENDED. PLEASE START IT.
     - VDEF REQUEST QUEUE PROCESSOR FOR "_$P(QUEUE,U)_" HAS EXITED.
  
  6) All VDEF alerts will send a MailMan message to the VDEF developer
     On FORUM that includes the alert text, the site name and ID and
     the date & time of the alert.
  
  7) Includes a new program VDEFKIDS that has two APIs, VDEFKIDS
     and POSTIN^VDEFKIDS.  These APIs are defined in the build as the
     Environment Check and post install routines.  Although the
     Pre-install routine does pre-installation type functions, it is
     defined in the build as the Environment Check routine, NOT the
     Pre-install routine. This is to prevent any VDEF* routines that
     are in the build from being filed over actively running routines
     causing an EDITED error trap error. By the time KIDS runs the
     Pre-Install routine, ALL the routines in the build have already
     been loaded whereas when the Environment routine is run, no other
     programs in the build have been installed.
  
     The pre-install routine will:
      - suspend all VDEF Request Queues
      - stop the TaskMan tasks associated with these queues
      - stop the VDEF checked out request monitor
      - stop the VDEF Request Queue process monitor
  
     The post-install routine (in production systems only) will:
      - un-suspend all VDEF Request Queues (change state to running)
      - create new TaskMan tasks for these queues
      - start the VDEF checked out request monitor
      - start the VDEF Request Queue process monitor
  
  8) The Status of VDEF components [VDEF Status] option screen has been
     modified. See the example that follows.
      - The VMS Process ID associated with the VDEF Request Queue process
        task has been added.
      - The TaskMan task status has been added.
      - The counter for Processed requests has been deleted.  This was
        useless information because it was simply a count of the number
        of records in the VDEF Request Queue that are in the Processed
        status and the fact that the count stopped at ">100".
      - The counter for Queued Up has been changed to display the actual
        number up to a maximum of 1000. If more than 1000 are queued up,
        the display will show "> 1000 .
      - The description "Requests in the queue  has been changed to
        "Requests waiting for purge 
  
    (example)
    Request Processor Status
      MAINTENANCE: Running and not Scheduled
      Current Task # [Proc]: 7399750 [21663B42]
      Requests waiting for purge: 14      Last request#: 14
      Checked Out(0)  Queued Up(0)  Errored Out(0)
  
  9) Changed the M lock used to protect the VDEF Request Queue so that
     it doesn't prevent using FileMan to access the VDEF queue file.
  
 10) Creates the new Application "VDEF ALERTS" and the new Mail Group
     "VDEF NATIONAL ALERTS" and changes the VistA Mail Group for VDEF
     Alerts from the HL7 group to the new VDEF group.
  
 11) Removed the Scheduled task from the Status of VDEF components [VDEF
     Status] display and added the TaskMan status of the task.
  
 12) Removed the XQASUPV variable from the alert call so that VDEF
     alerts are no longer forwarded to unread alerts supervisor mail
     group.
  
 13) Added the date and time and the TaskMan task status to the VDEF
     Status display.
  
  
 IRM NOTES:
 ===========
 Before installing this patch, make sure you have completely installed 
 XU*8.0*339 and run the '% program' conversion RELOAD^ZTMGRSET utility.
  
 This patch REQUIRES Kernel patch XU*8.0*339 which fixes a bug in the
 $$ASKSTOP^%ZTLOAD() API and also creates a new API JOB^%ZTLOAD().
 VDEF requires both of these to be updated by the XU*8.0*339 patch in
 Order for VDEF*1*3 to install.
  
 This VDEF patch uses the $$JOB^%ZTLOAD functionality released with
 XU*8.0*339. Please confirm that the post-KIDS install steps for XU*8.0*339
 have been done.  The following MUMPS code should indicate that XU*8.0*339 
 is in the second line of the %ZTLOAD routine:
 >ZL %ZTLOAD ZP +1:+2
  
 For the duration of the installation of this patch, all VDEF Request
 Queue processors that were in the Running state will be temporarily 
 suspended.  The pre-install and post-install routines will suspend and 
 then restart all Request Queue processors that were in the Running state 
 after installation of this patch.  VDEF messages will continue to 
 accumulate in the queues during suspension and will start processing 
 again after the patch has completed installation. This is the equivalent 
 of you using the VDEF Configuration and Status Menu option "SusR 
 Suspend/Run Request Queue  to suspend and restart the Request Queues.
  
 When you see the message "Waiting for processes to quit . .", there
 will be approximately a 5 second wait.
  
 PLEASE NOTE: The VDEF Post-install program will not start the VDEF 
 processes on test or Legacy systems that have the Test System flag set.
  
  
 IRM S POST-INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
 ====================================
 1. NEW MAIL GROUP AND APPLICATION FOR VDEF ALERTS
    After you have installed this patch, there will be a new Application
    named VDEF ALERTS which will have the Mail Group VDEF NATIONAL ALERTS
    assigned to it.  The new Mail Group will not have any local members in
    it. YOU MUST ASSIGN THE LOCAL MEMBERS.  It will have the remote member
    GARDNER.JEFF@FORUM.VA.GOV. Please verify these that these two new
    definitions are correctly set up. If a site does not have the Mail
    Group VDEF NATIONAL ALERTS, VDEF will continue the alerts to the HL7
    Mail Group.
  
 2. MODIFY THE  VDEF STARTUP OPTION  SCHEDULED TASK.
    Using the TaskMan option  Schedule/Unschedule Options , edit the
    parameters for the task VDEF STARTUP OPTION as indicated in the screen
    example shown here.

 Overview of Patch Items:
 ========================
 1) A pre-install routine, PREIN^VDEFKIDS, is included in this patch that
    suspends VDEF Request Queue processing through the duration of this
    patch installation. It also stops and deletes the TaskMan tasks driving
    the processes and the VDEF monitor processes.
  
 2) A post-install routine, POSTIN^VDEFKIDS, is included in this patch
    that restarts VDEF Request Queues after installation of this patch.
    It also creates new VDEF monitor tasks.
  
 3) The routine VDEFUTIL has been changed to not set the flag for an 
    unread VDEF Alert to be sent to the supervisor. This program has also
    been changed to prefix the date & time to the VDEF alert text and to
    use the new VDEF alert mail group to send a MailMan message to the VDEF
    developer whenever a VDEF alert occurs.
  
 4) The routine VDEFCONT has been changed to eliminate the false VDEF
    Alerts from being generated.  It has also been changed to include
    the name of the Request Queue in the VDEF Alert message.
  
 5) The routine VDEFREQ has been changed to eliminate the problem of
    TaskMan not restarting the VDEF Request Queue processor EN^VDEFREQ.
    Instead, VDEFREQ does not re-schedule itself with TaskMan but uses
    an M HANG command loop based on the number of seconds in file
    #579.3, field .05 - CHECK-OUT TIME LIMIT.
  
 6) The routine VDEFMNU has been changed to display the VMS process ID
    for the Request Queue Task in the Status of VDEF components [VDEF
    Status] display. The counter for Processed Requests has been dropped
    from the Status of VDEF components [VDEF Status] display. It was
    useless information.
  
 7) The routine VDEFQM has been changed to incorporate two VDEF APIs
    that will requeue requests that are stuck in the Checked Out or
    Errored Out state.
  
 8) A new routine VDEFMON has been created to monitor the Request Queue
    process and restart it if it dies as well as automatically re-queuing
    requests that have Errored Out or get stuck in the Checked Out status.
  
 9) There are no VDEF global changes in this patch.

 The "Request Processor Status" is simply the status flag of the process in
 a VDEF global. It is possible to have the status "Running" even if the VMS
 process of the task had died.
  
 IF THE REQUEST QUEUE PROCESSOR TASK (EN^VDEFREQ) IS RUNNING:
 The Request Processor Status will show "Running" and the task status will 
 show "Active-Running".
  
 IF THE REQUEST QUEUE PROCESSOR TASK (EN^VDEFREQ) IS SUSPENDED BY SITE 
 USING the VDEF Configuration and Status Menu:
 The Request Processor Status will show "Suspended" and the task status 
 will show "Interrupted".

 Logical Link Status
   VDEFVIE1: stopped or caught up
   VDEFVIE2: stopped or caught up
   VDEFVIE3: stopped or caught up
  
 Requestor Status
   MAINTENANCE: Activated      Dest.: VISTA HL7    Req. Queue: MAINTENANCE
  
  Request Processor Status
   MAINTENANCE: Suspended
   Current Task # [Proc]: 7410053 [0]  Task status: Interrupted
   Requests waiting for purge: 0      Last request#: 
   Checked Out(0)  Queued Up(0)  Errored Out(0)
  
 IMPORTANT:
 IF THE REQUEST QUEUE PROCESSOR TASK (EN^VDEFREQ) IS RUNNING BUT THE VMS 
 PROCESS HAS STOPPED:
 The Request Processor Status will STILL show "Running" and the task status
 will STILL show "Active-Running".
  
 This is because of the way that an application communicates with TaskMan 
 to stop a task. It makes a request to TaskMan to stop the task and waits 
 for the status of the task to go to "stop requested". Then the application
 quits back to TaskMan and only then does TaskMan update the task status to
 stopped or interrupted.  If the VMS process for the EN^VDEFREQ task had
 died, then the VDEFREQ program is not running and cannot quit back to
 TaskMan.  This is why the TaskMan task status stays "Active-Running".
