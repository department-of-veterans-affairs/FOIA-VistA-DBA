The diagnosis date refers to the first diagnosis of this cancer by any
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,2,0)
recognized medical practitioner.  This is often a clinical diagnosis
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,3,0)
and may not ever be confirmed histologically.  Even if confirmed
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,4,0)
later, the diagnosis date refers to the date of the first clinical
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,5,0)
diagnosis and not to the date of confirmation.  If upon medical and/or
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,6,0)
pathological review of a previous condition the patient is deemed to
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,7,0)
have had cancer at an earlier date, then the earlier date is the date
"^DD",165.5,165.5,3,21,8,0)
