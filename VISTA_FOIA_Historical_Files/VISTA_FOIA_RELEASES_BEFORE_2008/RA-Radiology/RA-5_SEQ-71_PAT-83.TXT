Associated patches: (v)RA*5*79     <<= must be installed BEFORE `RA*5*83'

Subject: AVERAGE WAIT TIMES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch adds a column of averages to the "DAYS WAIT -- COUNTS" table 
 that is within the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] 
 option.  It also fixes two new bugs that were reported in several Remedy 
 tickets and several other problems that were not reported.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS
 =========================
 1. <SUBSCRIPT>PTA+5^RAPMW2
    180473    
    180488     
    181794     
    182273     
    183130
    185303
    185415    
    There are other similar Remedy tickets re this subscript error.
  
 2. <SUBSCRIPT>FILTER2+4^RAPMW1
    184062
    185415
  
  
 ROUTINES MODIFIED
 =================
 Routine RAPMW
    (1) Initialize variables for the total and average Days Wait by 
 Procedure Type.
  
    (2) Shorten some comments and relocate some variables.
  
 Routine RAPMW1:
    (1) Calculate total and average Days Wait by Procedure Type.  
  
    (2) Pause the screen for the heading and footnote sections of the 
 summary report from the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] 
 option.  Previously, when many procedures were individually selected, the 
 header portion of the summary report exceeded the screen length, but 
 there was no screen pause to allow the user to view the listing that 
 scrolled off the screen.  This screen pause problem was discovered as a 
 result of the user entry "A" problem when "CPT Code/Procedure Name" was 
 used to select cases for the output (see RASELCT below.)
   
    (3) Relocate the COLHDS section to routine RAPMW2 to keep routine size 
 under 9000 bytes.  
  
    (4) Correct the summary report's footnote's list of 9 modalities so 
 that they match the list of 9 modalities in the detail report's 
 footnote.
  
    (5) Correct the selection by CPT Codes logic to reject cases that are 
 missing data for procedure.  This will prevent the 
 <SUBSCRIPT>FILTER2+4^RAPMW1 error.
  
 Routine RAPMW2:
    (1) Prevent the <SUBSCRIPT>PTA+5^RAPMW2 error when the registered case 
 is a broad procedure.  Previously, the summary report from the 
 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] option would abnormally 
 end with a <SUBSCRIPT> error if the procedure being processed did not 
 have a CPT Code assigned.  A case can be registered with a broad 
 procedure although the procedure must be changed later to a detail 
 procedure in order for the case to reach the exam status of "COMPLETE."  
 This bug was reported in the above Remedy tickets.
  
    (2) Pause the screen for the heading and footnote sections of the 
 detail report from the 'Summary/Detail report' [RA TIMELINESS REPORT] 
 option.
  
    (3) Add the COLHDS section that was in routine RAPMW1.
  
 Routine RASELCT:
    (1) Allow the user entry of "A" at the "Select Procedure/CPT Code:" 
 prompt to result in a display of procedures beginning with the letter 
 "A", in successive groupings of 5 procedures.  If there is only one 
 procedure beginning with the letter "A", then that procedure would be 
 automatically selected.  A user entry of "ALL" would be the only way to 
 select all procedures.  Previously, an entry of "A" resulted in all 
 procedures being selected.  This problem was discovered by the first 
 Release Manager for RA*5*79 and was not required to be fixed for RA*5*79 
 because it was a pre-existing problem.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   The install time for this patch should take less than 2 minutes.  
 Radiology users may remain on the system during the installation, because 
 only the  RA TIME*  options need to be locked during the installation.
  
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
  
  2. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of all routines exported with the patch.  
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global(*) - this option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the   
         transport global.
   
         (*) If your site had installed the class 2 version of RAPMW2,
             you will get a warning message as follows:
             
             RAPMW2   Before Checksum Calculated 70336421 expected value
             67754959
             RAPMW2   Calculated  76504533
  
  3. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
  
         When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*83.
    
         When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//", respond NO.
   
         When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? YES//", respond YES.
  
         When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
         enter the following:
      
           RA TIME*
   
         When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of 
         Order':", press the RETURN key to skip this prompt, since there
         are no protocols to place out of order.
   
  4. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*83).
