  HD0000000210336 PCMM COORDINATOR REPORTING PATIENTS ON INACTIVATION LIST
                  THAT ARE NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD
 
  Problem:
  =======
 
  Patch SD*5.3*498 changed the business rules pertaining to the 
  inactivation of a patient's PCMM assignment (introduced in patch
  SD*5.3*297). Specifically, patch SD*5.3*498 enabled the inactivation
  process if a provider change is found for the Team Position. Facilities with
  provider changes started receiving an unusual number of patient inactivation
  messages generated by SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK, scheduled to flag
  inactivation and generate messages on the 15th and on the last day of a month.
  
  According to the original software logic we should have received an array of
  providers that were assigned to the position  to be matched with providers 
  from evaluated outpatient encounters. It appeared that only one segment of an
  array was returned with the latest provider, so any appointments for previous 
  providers, if any, were ignored and a patient was inactivated incorrectly.
  This problem will be addressed by a follow up patch and the intended 
  functionality of patch SD*5.3*498 will be restored.
 
  Solution:
  ========= 
 
  This is an intermediate solution to prevent incorrect flagging for 
  inactivation. Routines SCMCTSK1 and SCMCTSK2 are being restored to their 
  original code which will restore the functionality that was active before 
  the installaton of patch SD*5.3*498.
  
  Patients assigned to a Team Position with a provider change will be
  excluded from evaluation for potential inactivation, as was introduced
  with patch SD*5.3*297, and no patient will be incorrectly marked for
  inactivation. The checksum of both routines is the same as before installation
  of patch SD*5.3*498.
 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 
 Users can be on the system during the installation of this patch but it has to
 be installed at least several minutes before the PCMM NIGHTLY TASK is scheduled 
 to run. To avoid a potential incorrect inactivation of patients, this patch
 should be installed before Oct 31st 2007. 
 
 Installation should take less than 1 minute.
