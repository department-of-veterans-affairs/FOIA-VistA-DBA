Associated patches: (v)XU*8*196    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*245'

Subject: Manila RDV fix.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 Test Sites: Manila
  
 Blood Bank Team Coordination:
 Clearance - July 17, 2002
  
 NOIS: MPI-1001-61340
  
 Description of the Situation:  the employees at the Manila site have a need
 to use the Remote Data View (RDV) utility to examine data to provide care
 and to resolve veteran claims for benefits.  When VistA initiates a
 Remote Data View, a record is written in the system being "visited" so that
 an audit trail of user's who have accessed that system can be maintained.
 A key data element used in the activation of RDV is the user's Social
 Security Number (SSN).  However, many user's at the Manila facility are not
 US citizens and thus do not have a SSN.  Thus, the RDV functionality would
 not allow them to activate the necessary capability.
  
 Solution to Situation:  the Remote Data View modules that check for user
 SSN will examine the involved sites (both requesting and responding) and if
 Manila is involved, special steps will be followed to compensate for the
 user not having an SSN.  An audit entry will still be recorded indicating
 that Manila was involved and the audit will reflect the user s internal
 number (called DUZ in VistA) along with the Institution ID for Manila. 
 This represents a somewhat brute-force solution, but rapidly opens the
 functionality to allow Philippine nationals to use the software and meet
 veteran care needs.

 =========================================================================
 Installation:
  
 >>>Non-RDV Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
  
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   4.  Non-RDV Users can remain on the system. This patch can be
       loaded any non-peak time. This patch can be queued for 
       install at non-peak hours. TaskMan can remain running.
  
   5.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*245'
                              ==========
  
         Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
  
         No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
         
   6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
