Subject: ADD FV CONSISTENCY CHK & RUN UNEMPLOYABLE/POW UPDATE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch was developed as a follow-up to the HEC VistA Enhancements 
 Phase III project.  The following functionality is included in this 
 patch:
  
 1. A new consistency check will be added to Registration for patients 
 with a Filipino Veteran branch of service. If a patient has a Filipino 
 Veteran branch of service, but is ineligible because of no World War II 
 military service dates or no proof of Filipino Veteran eligibility, a 
 consistency check message will be displayed if the Veteran Status field 
 is set to "YES".  This new consistency check has been added to the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS file (#38.6) as entry #86.
  
 2. A post-install routine will run that will search the Patient file (#2) 
 for verified POW or Priority 1 Unemployable veterans.  If the patient has
 a record in the Billing Patient file (#354), the RX copay status will be
 updated to 'Exempt' and the Exemption Reason will be updated to 'Former
 POW' or 'Unemployable Veteran'.  If the veteran has an RX copay test, the
 status will be updated to 'No Longer Applicable'.
