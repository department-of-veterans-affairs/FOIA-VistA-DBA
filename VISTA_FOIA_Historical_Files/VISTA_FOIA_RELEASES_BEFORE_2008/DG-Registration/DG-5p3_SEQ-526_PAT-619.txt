Subject: VIC REPLACEMENT PATIENT IMAGE CAPTURE SOFTWARE (PICS)

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
 This is an informational patch notifying sites of the Veteran Identification
 Card (VIC) Replacement project release.  The purpose of this informational 
 patch is to provide field personnel with instructions on how to acquire,
 install and implement the Patient Image Capture software (PICS) for the new
 VIC Replacement system. Additionally, this patch will also provide field
 personnel with information regarding the retrieval of end-user documentation
 and training materials for the new system.
  
 The Patient Image Capture software (PICS) for the new VIC system will be
 included on the workstation configurations as they are delivered by the
 vendor.  The implementation of the patient image capture software will be
 phased-in by VISN between late August and early November 2004.  The new VIC
 PICS software patch is completely independent of the existing VIC 
 functionality and will not impact the use of the existing VIC equipment.
  
 After implementation of the VIC replacement system further use of the old 
 VIC system will not be supported by the Office of Information.  For those
 sites that wish to disable the HL7 Link of the old VIC system, instructions
 have been provided in section 'VII.' below.  
  
  
  
 II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   1. The patient image capture software is used to take the veteran's picture 
      and request the card.  It also will send the picture of the veteran taken
      at the local facility to VistA Imaging, if the VistA Imaging server is
      operational.  Once the card request is made and submitted to the National
      Card Management Directory (NCMD) by the local facility, it is sent to the
      card production vendor who will produce and mail the card.  If the
      mailing address for the veteran does not pass the address validation
      software checks or if the veteran is homeless, the card will be mailed to
      the  requesting facility.  The card production vendor returns status
      information on the card requests to the NCMD.
  
   2. A web portal has been developed which provides reports based on the NCMD
      data on the status of the card requests that have been submitted by the
      stations.  The reports include information on specific card requests in
      various statuses as well as summary reports on the number of cards
      processed. 
  
   3. The VistA Registration DG*5.3*571 VETERAN ID CARD (VIC) REPLACEMENT patch
      provides server side support for the VIC Replacement system and the
      capability to print labels with veteran information that can be used in
      lieu of the embossing that is part of the existing VIC functionality. The
      labels may be placed on those non-electronic forms still in use. The
      VistA Registration DG*5.3*571 patch was released on August 10, 2004.
  
   4. VistA Imaging patch MAG*3*15 Import API Enhancements must be installed 
      for images to be saved to the VistA Imaging server.  The VistA Imaging
      MAG*3*15 patch was released on August 12, 2004.  
  
      ***** Note: Vista Imaging and Consolidated Sites *****
  
        Consolidated Sites as defined by VistA Imaging refers to sites 
        that have merged their VistA data bases into one computer system, 
        but have separate VistA imaging servers located at each facility.  
  
        VistA Imaging created a separate version of the Imaging software
        to deal with consolidated facilities.  The affected sites are as
        follows:
  
         * VISN 2
         * VISN 15
         * North Florida/South Georgia portion of VISN 8 (Gainesville, 
           Lake City & CBOCs)
         * VISN 23 South (Old VISN 14)
  
        Since these sites are running a different version of VistA Imaging,
        they will not be able to use patch MAG*3*15.  The import API 
        functionality will be included in a future release for consolidated
        sites in the version called 2.5T73.  This is planned to be released
        in September 2004.
  
        Solution:
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        The VistA Imaging Consolidated Sites need to configure 
        their PICS workstation to not store veterans pictures in VistA 
        Imaging by performing the following procedural steps:
  
          Step 1.  From the PICS Workstation menu select Patient/Settings/
          Step 2.  Uncheck the box labeled "Store picture in VistA Imaging 
          Step 3.  Press the OK button in the window that states "Warning -
                   by disabling this options, the patient picture will not be 
                   stored in VistA Imaging"
          Step 4.  Press the OK button in the Settings window.
