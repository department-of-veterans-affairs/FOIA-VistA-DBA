REGIONAL TREATMENT MODALITY is intended to identify the dominant modality
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",2,0)
of therapy delivered to the primary volume of interest.  In some cases,
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",3,0)
it may be appropriate to choose a code for its academic or economic
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",4,0)
interest, even though it may not reflect the majority of the patient's
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",5,0)
therapy.  For example, a patient with carcinoma of the nasopharynx may
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",6,0)
receive original treatment using a linear accelerator and then have a
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",7,0)
boost with High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  In a department with a
"^DIC",166.13,166.13,"%D",8,0)
special interest in brachytherapy, the code 15 would be chosen.

the Radiation Oncologist.
