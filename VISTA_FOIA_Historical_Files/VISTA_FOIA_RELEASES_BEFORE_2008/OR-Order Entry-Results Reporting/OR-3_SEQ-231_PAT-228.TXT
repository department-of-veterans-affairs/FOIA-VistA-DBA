  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
 implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment
 for the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of
 the billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the
 PFSS On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".
 The ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be
 provided at the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent
 Integrated Billing patch.

 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Overview
 --------
 Order Entry/Results Reporting(OE/RR) via the Computerized Patient
 Record System(CPRS) has been identified by the Patient Financial
 Services System(PFSS) as one of the systems that needs to be modified
 in order to ultimately send charge data to the COTS billing replacement
 system.  The patch OR*3.0*228 represents phase II of the OE/RR portion
 of the PFSS effort to Revenue Improvement.  Phase I of the OE/RR
 portion of the project is contained in OR*3.0*215.
  
  
 Functional Description
  
 * Add PFSS Account Reference Number field to the Order file.  The Order 
 file (#100) will be modified to include a new field to store the account 
 reference associated with an order.  The new Account Reference field will 
 be a pointer to the PFSS Account file (#375).
  
 * Store Visit String with the Order record in the Order file for Lab and 
 Radiology orders placed in CPRS GUI.
  
 * Associate PFSS Account Reference Number with orders being released.
  
    * Ignore PFSS Account Reference Number for historical visits.
  
    * Get PFSS Account Reference Number for event-delayed orders.
  
    * Get PFSS Account Reference Number related to a scheduled appointment.
  
    * Get PFSS Account Reference Number related to a hospitalization.
  
    * Get PFSS Account Reference Number for existing PCE visit.
  
    * Null PFSS Account Reference Number will be stored at release if no 
 account reference is found using specific guidelines.
  
 * Update Radiology order with Pre-Certification account reference.
  
    * Get Pre-Certification account reference from 'Accept' response for 
 front door orders.  OE/RR will only use the account reference, passed in 
 the PV1 segment, field 50, of the accept message to update the order in 
 the Order file (#100) if the account reference in the order is a null 
 value. If the order already has an account reference in the order, OE/RR
 will ignore the Pre-certification account reference passed in the accept
 response. 
  
    * Get Pre-Certification from Radiology back door orders.  When an 
 order is entered into Radiology using the back door Radiology options.  
 OE/RR will only use the account reference, passed in the PV1 segment, 
 field 50, of the back door order message to update the Radiology order in 
 the Order file (#100) if the account reference in the order is a null 
 value.
  
 * Provide new OR API that returns the PFSS Account Reference Number 
 stored as field 97 of the Order file (#100).
  
 * Provide PCE with the account reference related to an order.  OE/RR will 
 provide PCE with the order account reference to associate with Lab and 
 Radiology charges.
