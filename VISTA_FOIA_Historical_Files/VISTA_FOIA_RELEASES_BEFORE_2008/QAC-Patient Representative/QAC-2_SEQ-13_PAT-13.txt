Subject: PRINTING REPORTS/NEW ROC NUMBERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch deals with problems printing reports, and entering new
 contacts.
  
 OKL-0999-70997, NYH-1199-11897 and ALX-0700-70377. When printing the
 Service/Discipline Issue Totals Report [QAC SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT], and
 selecting one Service/Discipline, sites are getting a report for all
 Service/Disciplines if they queue the report.  The same problem was found
 to occur with the option Discipline Issue Totals [QAC DISC ISSUE TOT]
  
 It was also reported in OKL-0999-70997 that an undefined error occurs
 sporadically when using this option.  It was found that the error occurs
 when using the "^" to exit the option at the prompt
 Would you like this report for one Service/Discipline only? NO// YES
 Select QAC SERVICE/DISCIPLINE NAME:  
  
 While making changes for these reports it was noted that there were
 problems when "^" was entered at some prompts or when the user was timed
 out.  These problems were also addressed.
  
 MOU-1099-32886  When printing the Service/Discipline Issue Totals Report
 [QAC SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT] and selecting one Service/Discipline, if that
 Service/Discipline was created with mixed upper and lower case letters, no
 records print.
  
 TAM-1299-30242  When entering a new contact - option Enter New Contact
 [QAC NEW] the user occasionally gets an undefined error at SITE+8^QACUTL0.
 While correcting this problem a change was made in the process of creating
 Reports of Contact record numbers.  The station number portion of the
 number (first three digits) is now created by using an API in routine
 ^VASITE.
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 ALX-0700-70377, MOU-1099-32886, NYH-1199-11897, OKL-0999-70997,
 TAM-1299-30242
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VistA users will not be affected.
  
         Enter New Contact [QAC NEW]
         Edit Contact Record [QAC EDIT]
         Service/Discipline Issue Totals [QAC SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT]
