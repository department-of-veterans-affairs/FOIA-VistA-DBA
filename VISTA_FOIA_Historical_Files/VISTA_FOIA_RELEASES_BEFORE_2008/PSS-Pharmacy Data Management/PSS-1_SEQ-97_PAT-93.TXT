Version : 1        SEQ #97                      Status: Released

Subject: APIS TO SUPPORT CPRS GUI V26

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 1. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 has requested a 
 new Application Programming Interface (API) from Pharmacy Data Management 
 V. 1.0. The new API will allow CPRS to request the current status of any 
 order for both Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 
 7.0. 
  
 2. During internal testing, it was discovered that the Expected First 
 Dose display in CPRS was inconsistent for PRN orders. If a provider 
 checked the PRN box, no Expected First Dose is displayed. However, if the 
 schedule selected had PRN in the name, an Expected First Dose is 
 displayed, which is not correct. This patch assists in correcting this
 problem by modifying the TYPE OF SCHEDULE field (#5) in the ADMINISTRATION
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to allow PRN. This information will then be provided
 in an API to CPRS. PSI-05-026.
  
 3. During installation of this patch, a post-install routine will run 
 that will identify any schedules contained in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE 
 file (#51.1). A mail message containing this list will be forwarded to 
 the person who installed the patch. Please forward this message to the 
 Pharmacy ADPAC.
