Description:
============

 This project consists of 12 patches that work together to create a new
 Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
 rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
 finding types are included in the index. Beside, this patch also contains
 a fix for two NOIS calls (see description below).
  
 The 12 patches that comprise this project are:
  
  PXRM*1.5*12
  DG*5.3*478
  GMPL*2*27
  GMRV*5*6
  LR*5.2*295
  OR*3*157
  PSS*1*62
  PSS*1*89
  PSJ*5*90
  PSO*7*118
  PX*1*119
  RA*5*33
  YS*5.01*77
  
 The purpose of this patch (PSO*7*118) is to lay the groundwork for these
 changes by creating new cross-references in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
 that will be responsible for updating the new Clinical Reminders index
 global. These are the new cross-references added to the PRESCRIPTION 
 file (#52) and the fields used as the trigger-points. The type of these
 cross-references is 'New', not 'Traditional'.

                                     RELEASED DATE/TIME (#31) 
  
   ACRR   REFILL (#52.1)             DAYS SUPPLY (#1.1)
                                     RELEASED DATE/TIME (#17)
  
   ACRP   PARTIAL (#52.2)            DAYS SUPPLY (#.041)  
                                     RELEASED DATE/TIME (#8)

 When using the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT] option the possibility
 exists that the prompt "Are you sure you want to release Original/Partial/
 Fill for Prescription #" will not be asked. This patch will fix this 
 problem.
