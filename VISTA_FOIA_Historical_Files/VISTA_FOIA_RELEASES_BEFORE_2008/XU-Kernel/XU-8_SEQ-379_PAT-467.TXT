                       applied for the NPI through CMS' National Plan
                       and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).  NPI
                       Confirmation Letters are sent by CMS and 
                       indicate the NPI assigned.  Practitioners may
                       present their NPI Confirmation Letter as a
                       source document to verify the accuracy of the
                       NPI or you may contact your Local NPI
