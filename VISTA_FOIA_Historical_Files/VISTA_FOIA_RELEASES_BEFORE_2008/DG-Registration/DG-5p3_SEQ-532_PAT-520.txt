Subject: SUPPORT FOR HDR

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch is in support of the Health Data Repository (HDR) project.
  This patch can be installed regardless of whether or not your site is 
  ready to send messages to the HDR.  The changes will be transparent to 
  your site if you aren't HDR enabled/ready.
  
  The HDR has been assigned station number 200HD.  A number of routines
  assume that the station number is a 3 digit number without a suffix
  and utilizes the plus sign to get the station number.  This would change
  that station number from 200HD to 200.  To prevent this from becoming 
  a problem, the following routines have been modified: VAFCTFIN,
  VAFCTFPR and VAFCTFU.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        DG*5.3*520.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
    
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
