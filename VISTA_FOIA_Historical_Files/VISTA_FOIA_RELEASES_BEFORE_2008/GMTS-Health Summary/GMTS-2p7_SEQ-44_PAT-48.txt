Description: 
============

   
   This patch exports the REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW Health Summary Type and
   installs it in the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142), providing Remote
   Data Views of Oncology Data.  It also conducts a check to make sure
   the Oncology Component is installed in the Patient Data Exchange's (PDX)
   VAQ - DATA SEGMENT file (#394.71).  This provides two methods for health
   care providers and cancer registrars to request and view oncology data
   on a patient seen at multiple sites: Remote Data Views for CPRS (GUI)
   users and Patient Data Exchange for List Manager users.
