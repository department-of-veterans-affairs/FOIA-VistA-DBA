Subject: UNWINDER changes for CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

  This patch provides enhancements and bug fixes for the protocol unwinder
  functionality.
  
  ENHANCEMENTS:
  ============= 
  1.  This patch will allow a calling package to define the variable
  XQORM("ALT") to allow an alternate look-up.  This will allow the user to
  enter a choice that does not appear on the menu.  This is useful when the
  developer wants to display a list of possible choices, but allow the user
  to also select from items not displayed.  This will be utilized by
  the upcoming release of CPRS.
  
  2  This patch adds "E" as an allowable flag for XQORM(0).  The "E" flag
  will allow ambiguous lookups to be resolved interactively when XQORM is
  called without XQORM(0) containing an "A".
  
  
  BUG FIXES:
  ==========
  1.  This patch will correct a problem which caused a user to be exited
  from a menu if they inappropriately answered a prompt for a numeric
  range.  If, for example, the user mistakenly entered 1-4B, they would be
  prompted 'For entry 1-4B enter: '.  If the user entered return at the
  prompt, they would be exited from the menu.
  
  2.  This patch will fix a problem which caused a user to only see the
  last few selectable options when they attempted to ^^JUMP from within
  a List Manager application.  Full screen mode will now be invoked earlier
  so that all selectable choices will be viewable.
  
  3.  This patch also fixes an error caused when a user entered
  extraordinarily long selections (usually caused by something laying
  on the keyboard).

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  The protocol unwinder affects many applications.  For this reason, it
  is recommended that you install this patch during non-peak hours to
  minimize possible disruption for users.  Alternately you may
  wish to install this patch during scheduled downtime.  Installation
  will take less than 1 minute.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XU*8.0*62):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XU*8.0*62.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
