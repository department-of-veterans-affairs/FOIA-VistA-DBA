 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 This patch includes the data needed to calculate a fee schedule amount
 based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (RBRVS) for calendar year
 2006.  The RBRVS fee schedule for future calendar years will be issued by
 a patch as they become available.
  
 The RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files. These
 files are all stored in global "^FB".  The four files are:
  
        FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) file
        FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) file
        FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98) file
        FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) file
  
 The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the
 FB global by approximately 5 MB. If you are journaling ^FB, please insure
 you have adequate journal space before installing.
  
 Installation of this patch will affect the menu options used to enter or
 edit payments for the Medical Fee program (outpatient) and ancillary
 payments for the Civil Hospital program.  The calendar year 2006 RBRVS fee
 schedule will be used for payments that have a date of service on or after
 March 1, 2006.  The RBRVS fee schedules for calendar years 1999, 2000,
 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 will be will be retained in the computer
 and will continue to be used for payments that have a date of service on
 or after September 1, 1999 and before March 1, 2006.
  
 The computer would have used the 2005 RBRVS fee schedule for any payments
 entered prior to the installation of this patch that had a date of service
 on or after March 1, 2006.  Existing payments are NOT modified by this
 patch.  The fee schedule amount is only calculated when payments are 
 entered or edited.
  
 The PLACE OF SERVICE code is used to determine if the facility or 
 non-facility practice expense Relative Value Unit (RVU) should be used
 during RBRVS fee schedule calculations.  The list of codes  considered
 facility and non-facility has been updated by this patch to conform with
 Medicare practices.

      -------------------

      Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
  
 The following four options are used to enter or edit ancillary payments
 for the Civil Hospital program:
  
      Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment  [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
      Multiple Ancillary Payments          [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
