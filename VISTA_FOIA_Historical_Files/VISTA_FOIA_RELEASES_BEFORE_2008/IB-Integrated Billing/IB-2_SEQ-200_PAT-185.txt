Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the following problems in the Integrated Billing (IB)
 package as requested by the VHA CO Diagnostic Measures group.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following E3R(s):
 ------------------------------------------
 There are no E3Rs associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1. HUN-0901-20678  Reasons Not Billable Report
 2. CPH-0801-40361  Follow-up report
 3. CHA-0602-32725  Veterans with Unverified Eligibilities Report
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 1. HUN-0901-20678  Reasons Not Billable Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the Reasons Not Billable Report [IBJD REASONS NOT BILLABLE] is run,
 the amounts displayed in the report do not reflect the amounts not billed,
 but rather the total amounts for billed AND unbilled encounters.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The report's compile routine (IBJDB21), has been modified to correct this
 problem. Report routine IBJDB2 has been modified to kill off "trailing"
 variables (IBEPS, IBPRT) that were left over after processing the report.
  
  
 2. CPH-0801-40361  Follow-up report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A site reported that when running the CHAMPVA/CHAMPUS (Tricare) Follow-Up
 Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP CHAMPVA/TRICARE] for AR Categories 2-6, and choosing
 to sort by one division, they get bills on the report that belong to other
 divisions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The report's compile routine (IBJDF51), has been modified to correct this
 problem. Report routines IBJDF5 and IBJDF53 have been modified to kill off
 "trailing" variables (IBDH, IBPRT, VA("BID"), VA("PID")) that were left
 over after processing the report.
  
  
 3. CHA-0602-32725  Veterans with Unverified Eligibilities Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Because the Veterans with Unverified Eligibility Report [IBJD INTAKE UNV
 ELIG] can also include veterans who have had their eligibility verified for
 at least 2 years, the report's option name and option description appear to
 be misleading.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The report option has been renamed the Veterans with Verified/Unverified
 Eligibility Report and the option description has been changed to read
 the following:
  
 This report lists patients who have been treated at a facility, but whose
 eligibility has not been verified. This report will also list patients with
 verified eligibility for at least 2 years, if any.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Iowa City
 Hampton
 Cleveland
 Huntington
 Butler
