  Description:
  ============
  This patch requires running the purge message option and shutting down
  all links and filers before installing the patch.
   
  This patch provides both additional functionality and NOIS fixes.
   
  First, it provides fixes for the following NOISes:  BAC-0599-40603 and 
  IND-0599-40402. One NOIS reported, in some cases, a failure to display 
  the message text after selecting an individual record from the list. 
  The other NOIS reported the routine HLCSRPT errorred out with an 
  undefined variable message in some circumstances. 
   
  Second, additional functionality is provided as follows:
  Refined message searchs. The messages search is now expanded to allow
  the user to select a message search based any combination (or all) of
  the search fields. They include status code, message type, event type
  and logical link. The default entry for each field is "ALL". As before,
  all message searching will be limited to a user entered start date/time.
  The single criteria message searching is replaced with this enhanced 
  searching capability. 
  Pending messages. The option for pending messages has not changed.
  Error listing. An option providing for the display of messages that
  are in an error status is added. The default is all errorred messages,
  but the user may select a specific error code.
   
  This patch also contains the DD for file 773, Message Administration
  File. It adds a new cross-reference, "AG", which pertains to the
  Status field. A Post-Install routine is run to set the cross-reference.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================    
    1.  Use the option 'Purge Message Text File Entries' option to remove
        old messages.
   
    2.  Shutdown the VISTA HL7 package. Execute the following steps in
        the listed order:
  
        a.  For OpenVMS sites, if you have any TCP/IP listeners
            implemented through UCX, use UCX to shut those listeners
            down. Do this by disabling each listener's service in UCX.
        b.  If you are a Cache site running a multi-threaded listener,
            use Cache's "JobExam" utility to force-exit the listener
            process.
        c.  Use the "TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop" option to shut
            down the TCP/IP Link Manager if it is running (for sites
            that have installed HL*1.6*49).
        d.  Use the "Shut Down All Logical Links" to shut down all
            running logical links (this command also shuts down any
            single-threaded listeners.)
        e.  Use the "Stop all incoming filers" and "Stop all outgoing
            filers" options to shut down all running incoming and
            outgoing filers.
   
    3.  User are allowed on the system during installation.  Do NOT inhibit
        logins and do NOT place Taskman in a wait state.
   
    4.  Some of these routines are new.  Currently we do not recommend that
        you add these routines to your map set.
    
    5.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. This
        option loads the KIDS package into a Transport global onto your
        system.
   
    6.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. From
        programmer prompt Do ^XPDKRN.
    
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the Installation menu, use the following
        options:
    
           2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3 Print Transport Global
           4 Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5 Backup a Transport Global
           6 Install Package(s)
               INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*50
                             =========
   
    8.  Restart the VISTA HL7 package.  This includes:
  
        a. Restarting all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing
           filers.  Use the 'Restart All Links and Filers' option.
        b. Restart the HL7 Link Manager (only sites which have 
           HL*1.6*49).
        c. UCX Sites: Restart the HL7 TCP/IP service using your site's
           standard procedures.
