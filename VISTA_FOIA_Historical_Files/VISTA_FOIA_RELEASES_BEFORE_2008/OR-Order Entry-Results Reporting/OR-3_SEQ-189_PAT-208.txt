Subject: ADD PCE OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTERS TO DOD REPORTS SADR

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch is being done in coordination with and in conjunction
  with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Federal Health
  Information Exchange (FHIE) Enhancement Project, which shall 
  include current and historical data feeds on selected DOD data
  types for active duty and retired military members.
  
 A new report was added with this patch that is
 available on the DOD menu within the CPRS Reports Tab.
  
   It is:
  
      Outpatient Encounters
  
 This report enables additional Federal Health Information Exchange (FHIE)
 data to be retrieved via the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 Remote Data View (RDV).  DoD Standard Ambulatory Data Record (SADR)
 Outpatient Encounters will be available under the Dept. of Defense tree
 as the "Outpatient Encounter" report.
  
 The fields displayed include:
 1.  Encounter Date
 2.  Facility
 3.  Hospital Location Code and Descriptive Text
 4.  Encounter Provider ID
 5.  PCM Code
         * note that for #5 and 6, DoD can only give us a code, not a name.
 6.  Diagnosis codes and descriptions (up to 4)
 7.  Procedure codes and descriptions (up to 4)
 8.  Evaluation and Management code and description
  
 The following is a sample (with identifying information removed) of the
 SADR view:
  
 Date         Facility          Hospital Location
  
 Jul 02, 2003 FT POLK - BAYNE-JONES ACH BIA Emergency Medical Clinic
 Encounter Provider ID: RICHARDSE
              PCM Code: 093603735
             Diagnosis: 719.49 JOINT PAIN-MULT JTS
                        V72.5 RADIOLOGICAL EXAM NEC
             Procedure: J1885 KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJ
                        90782 INJECTION, SC/IM
               E and M: 99283 EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT
  
  Changes are also being made to the code that generates the
  following DOD Reports to minimize future maintenance:
  
         ORRPW DOD PHARMACY ALL OUT
         ORRPW DOD RADIOLOGY REPORT
         ORRPW DOD LAB ORDERS
         ORRPW DOD LAB CHEM
         ORRPW DOD LAB SP
         ORRPW DOD LAB CY
         ORRPW DOD LAB MICRO
  
  This patch adds and modifies entries to the OE/RR Reports file
  (#101.24) for several DOD reports.
  
  WARNING: Items in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) with entry
  numbers greater than 999 are reserved, and should not be used
  for local enhancements.  If you have any local changes to items
  in this number range, that you want to keep, move them to an
  internal number <1000.  This patch will delete these entries 
  numbers before proceeding with the install.
    
  Changes to entries in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24)
  are as follows:
  
  NUMBER: 1102  ORRPW DOD - Department of Defense Reports
   DESCRIPTIVE TEXT: Dept. of Defense Reports
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD ALLERGIES ADV         
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD ADT EXP               
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD CONSULTS              
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD DISCHARGE SUMMARY     
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD LAB                   
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD PCE OUTPT ENCOUNTER   
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD PHARM ALL OUT         
     ITEM: ORRPW DOD RAD REPORT
  
  This patch also fixes a problem on the CPRS GUI Reports Tab for the
  Microbiology report found under Clinical Reports Laboratory sub-tree
  When selecting the Microbiology report, the following error may occur
  at some sites where incomplete microbiology data exists.
  
  $ZE= XTRCT+9^ORDV05E:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable    
  MICRO(63.05,6969870.9155,.05,"E"), -DSM-I-ECODE, MUMPS error code: M6
  
  An example of the incomplete microbiology data in the Lab Data (#63)
  file that has been found to exist follows:
  
  ^LR(45257,"MI",6969870.9155,0) = ^^^^^^^^^3030128.09291
  ^LR(45257,"MI",6969870.95777,0) = ^^^^^^^^^3030128.06281
  ^LR(45257,"MI",6969870.95778,0) = ^^^^^^^^^3030128.062817
  ^LR(45257,"MI",6969870.95779,0) = ^^^^^^^^^3030128.062806
  ^LR(45257,"MI",6969871.77999,0) = ^^^^^^^^^3030127.230219
  
  This patch does not fix the incomplete data nodes, but the CPRS
  code is being patched so that when this type of data is encountered,
  the Microbiology report won't crash.
