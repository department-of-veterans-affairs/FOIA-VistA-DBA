Associated patches: (v)GMTS*2.7*49 <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMTS*2.7*61'

Subject: Remote Medicine Report Fix

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 
   This patch is part of a coordinated two patch          NOIS NHM-1101-11873
   fix for a problem reported on Remote Data Views             LEB-0802-22187
   of Medicine Health Summary Components. 
 
   Prior to this patch, the Medicine Health Summary
   components used Mailman to process the reports. 
   Mailman required that the users have an Access 
   and Verify code at the "remote" site.  Since the
   user did not have Access and Verify codes on the
   remote system, the component would fail to return
   data from the remote site.
 
   This fix requires both this patch and a companion
   patch from the Medicine package.  The Medicine 
   patch is:
 
      MC*2.3*36
 
   The Medicine patch is not required for installation,
   but it is required to fix the Medicine Health Summary
   component Remote Data View problem.
