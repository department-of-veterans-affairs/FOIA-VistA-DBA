Subject: SEARCH BY AUTHOR/SIGNED NOTES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When using the "Custom View"  or "Signed Notes by Author" option in CPRS 
 GUI application, the existing routines search for documents by who signed
 the note/document and not by the Author of the note/document.
  
 The same is true for the Roll and Scroll application, menu option "2b Review
 Progress Notes" under the TIU MAIN MENU CLINICIAN/Progress Notes User Menu.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 FAV-0401-71563  Signed for notes display
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Lists are only showing notes/documents signed by the Author and omitting
 notes/documents that were signed by someone else for the author. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 By using a different index produce lists by Author that are signed (by 
 anyone).
  
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 Routines TIUSRVLO and TIUSRVLL were using the index "ACLSB" which is based
 on the signer of the document.  Changed to use index "APTCL" which is by 
 patient, class and date. Then check if it was authored by the person 
 the search is being done on and if it is signed.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  It should be 
 scheduled during off peak hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*194):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*194.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options

         ORDERS MENU             CPRS Menu
         REVIEW PROGRESS NOTES   Review Progress Notes
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
     you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
