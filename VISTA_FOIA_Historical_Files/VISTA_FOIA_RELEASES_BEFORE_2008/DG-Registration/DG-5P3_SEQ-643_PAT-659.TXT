Subject: Ionizing Radiation Exposure Method and Help Text Updates

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released as an emergency with a November 13, 2006
 compliance date because there are several other initiatives that are
 dependent on the release of this project, and because VHA Directive
 2006-048 Verification of Ionizing Radiation (IR) Exposure was prematurely
 released on September 12, 2006.
  
 Note:  This patch is being released along with patch EAS*1.0*75 Update 
        Radiation Exposure Method EAS in host file DG_53_P659.KID. Please
        see the National Patch Module patch description for EAS*1.0*75 for
        details concerning the functionality of that patch.
  
 In compliance with VHA Directive 2006-048 Verification of Ionizing
 Radiation (IR) Exposure (Electronic Document/Data Management System (EDMS)
 #328586), the Radiation Exposure Method for veterans should now include
 additional methods that do not qualify them for Enrollment Priority
 Group 6. Patches DG*5.3*659 and EAS*1*75 implement this new required
 functionality as well as the other changes described below.
  
 1.  NEW CODES FOR RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD
  
  Changes have been made to the RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD (#.3212) field in
  the PATIENT (#2) file.  The data values and meanings have been changed as
  follows:
  
 Old Value                  New Value                  Enrollment Priority
 --------------------       ------------------------   -------------------
 Nagasaki/Hiroshima         Hiroshima/Nagasaki          6
 code: N                    code: 2
  
 Nuclear Testing            Atmospheric Nuclear         6
 code: T                    Testing
                            code: 3
  
 Both                       H/N and Atmospheric         6
 code: B                    Nuclear Testing
                            code: 4
  
                            Underground Nuclear         no special priority
                            Testing
                            code: 5
  
                            Exposure at Nuclear         no special priority
                            Facility
                            code: 6
  
                            Other                       no special priority
                            code: 7
  
  
  
 Because RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD is now involved in the determination of 
 Enrollment Priority, this patch, DG*5.3*659 adds a new field RADIATION
 EXPOSURE METHOD (#76) to the PATIENT ENROLLMENT (#27.11) file. This new
 field will be displayed in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT option screen #2
 Priority Factors with the label 'Rad Exp Method.' If RADIATION EXPOSURE
 INDICATED (#.32103) in the PATIENT FILE (#2) is set to 'Yes' and the
 RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD (#.3212) in the same file is set to 2, 3 or 4,
 then assign an Enrollment Priority of 6.

 3.  TRIGGER LOGIC CHANGES
  
  A. When changes were made to the help text on the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY 
     CODE #.361 field of the PATIENT #2 File, it was discovered that the
     code in the trigger logic for one of the cross references still
     contained a $N reference. This was replaced with the appropriate $O
     reference.
  
     Note: This change is internal to the software and is transparent to
     the user.
  
     The trigger affected is:
  
     Cross reference #1: stuffs the PATIENT #2 File PRIMARY
                         ELIGIBILITY CODE #.361 field data
                         value into the PATIENT ELIGIBILITIES multiple
                         (file #2 field #361).
  
  B. When changes were made to the help text on the PATIENT #2 file
     RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED? #.32103 field, it was discovered
     that the code in the trigger logic for two of the cross references
     still contained a $N reference. These were replaced with the
     appropriate $O reference.  
  
     Note:  This change is internal to the software and is transparent to 
     the user.
  
     The triggers affected are:
  
     Cross reference #1: deletes the value of the PATIENT #2 file
                         RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD #.3212 field
                         if the value of the PATIENT #2 file 
                         RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED? #.32103
                         field is set to NO.
  
     Cross reference #2: deletes the value of the PATIENT #2 file
                         RADIATION REGISTRATION DATE #.32111 field
                         if the value of the PATIENT #2 file 
                         RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED? #.32103 field
                         is set to NO.
  
  
 4. BULLETIN CHANGE
  
    This patch contains an update to the text of an Eligibility bulletin
    sent to report consistency check failures during the
    Enrollment/Eligibility upload process. This bulletin is sent when
    VistA receives a Z11 record for a veteran who previously had been
    verified as being ineligible and had their PATIENT #2 file PERIOD
    OF SERVICE #.323 field on VistA changed to OTHER NON-VETERANS and
    where the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) had changed the veteran's
    eligibility status to eligible.
  
    The new bulletin should be received by members of the mail group 
    DGEN ELIGIBILITY ALERT.
  
         OLD BULLETIN TEXT 
         -----------------
         Patient was previously determined to be ineligible for
         VA health care. Upon review, the individual is now
         determined to be eligible for VA care.  Please update
         period of service and complete a new application for
         enrollment in VistA.
  
         NEW BULLETIN TEXT
         ----------------- 
         Patient was previously determined to be ineligible for
         VA health care. Upon review, the individual is determined
         to be eligible for VA care.  Please update period of 
         service and other eligibility data as needed.

  ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
   
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  
   
  Install Time - 1 minute
  
  Note 1: A post-install conversion routine will be run to convert the 
          old data values in the RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD field (#.3212)
          for the records in the PATIENT (#2) file. This routine will
          delete the RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD (#.3212) field data value
          (file #2) if the RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED? (#.32103) field
          data value (file #2) is set to 'No'.
  
          This conversion routine will also bulk fill RADIATION EXPOSURE 
          METHOD (#.3212) to 3 - Atmospheric Nuclear Testing if the
          RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED? (#.32103) in the PATIENT (#2) file
          is set to 'Yes' ane RADIATION EXPOSURE METHOD (#.3212) is null.
  
          This routine will process approximately 250,000 records in 30
          minutes.
  
  Note 2: You should stop the HL7 filers prior to the install to prevent
          possible 'No Source Errors' from occurring. No transmissions 
          will be lost if the filers are stopped first; they will be picked
          up once the filers are restarted. The filers should be restarted
          after the post-install conversion routine finishes.
  
  
    1.   DOWNLOAD HOST KIDS FILE
         -----------------------
         Download the KIDS file DG_53_P659.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
         directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake OI Field 
         Office to the appropriate directory on your system.
  
    2.   LOAD DISTRIBUTION
         -----------------
         Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION
         menu, and enter:  the directory onto which you have downloaded
         the host file, immediately followed by DG_53_P659.KID.

         a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
   
    6.   Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
