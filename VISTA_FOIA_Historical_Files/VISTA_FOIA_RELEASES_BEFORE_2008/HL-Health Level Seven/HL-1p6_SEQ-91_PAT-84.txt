 ISSUE DESCRIPTIONS:
 ===================
  
 Issue #1 Description
 ----------------------
 Note: This applies to all sites.
  
 A. 
 When a site shuts down their LLPs using menu OPTION: Start/Stop Links [HL 
 START] or OPTION: Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL],
 the task stops properly, but TaskMan retains the task in its running task
 list.
  
 This patch, along with patch XU*8*225 'ZISTCP and ZU Fixes' will ensure 
 that TaskMan properly removes terminated tasks from its running task list.
  
 This patch may be installed before or after patch XU*8*225.  However, this
 particular fix will only work after both patches have been installed.
  
 B.
 VistA sites that are running Cache/NT and that are migrating to a
 Cache/VMS environment will no longer use the HL7 options to start or stop 
 their multi-listener logical links.  Instead, these sites will use the 
 functionality provided by TCP/IP Services in OpenVMS.
  
 This patch will include the necessary code changes in VistA HL7 to 
 disable the use of the HL7 options to start and stop multi-listener 
 logical links in Cache/VMS environments.

 Issue #2 Description
 ----------------------
 Note: This applies only to sites that are Cache/VMS and sites that are 
       migrating from Cache/NT to Cache/VMS .
  
 Warning: After installation of this patch, Cache/VMS sites will no longer 
          have the capability of starting their multi-listeners through the
          HL7 options; therefore, Cache/VMS sites must immediately create
          and enable their multi-listeners as TCP/IP services, as described
          in the 'Special Instructions for VMS Sites that Use TCP/IP
          Services' section below.
  
 This patch includes the necessary code changes to the VistA HL7 package to
 facilitate a multi-listener using an external service (TCP/IP service) for
 Cache/VMS sites. Once this patch is installed, Cache'/VMS sites will only
 be able to use an external service (TCP/IP service) to start up their HL7
 multi-listener. VistA HL7 will no longer support the M-based HL7
 multi-listener on Cache'/VMS systems for the reasons described below.
  
 New VMS sites running Cache' can experience a problem related to IP 
 address. The problem occurs because the site's IP address is known by the
 old NT cluster alias IP.  In the new operating system environment, this
 address can float from node to node depending on which node is booted
 first.  Also, the new operating system has additional flexibility in that
 multiple task managers can be run concurrently.  When NT sites start their
 "IP/port=5000" listener using menu OPTION: TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
 START/STOP LINK MANAGER], task may or my not run on the cluster alias
 node. Further complicating the problem, the listener job can stop and be
 automatically restarted by TaskMan, again floating to whatever TaskMan
 node is least busy.
  
 The HL Logical Link file (#870) has a field called Startup Node (#400.06).
 This field allows for the specification of a node of a TaskMan box:volume
 pair.  But, Cache sites cannot currently run TaskMan in DCL context, and 
 so cannot enable the box:volume pair transfer.  Even if DCL context was
 enabled, the listener still points to a node that may or may not be the
 current cluster alias IP.
  
 Issue #3 Description
 -----------------------
 Note: This applies only to sites that are running DSM/VMS
  
 Existing DSM sites that are currently using the HLSEVEN TCPIP service are 
 using the IEN of file HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) as a parameter to the 
 corresponding HLSEVEN.COM file.  This is a potential problem if the 
 actual port of the TCPIP service is not the same as that of the 
 entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK file.  
  
 There is now an option for these sites to use the actual tcp port number
 as the parameter.  A new command file, HLS5000DSM.COM is included as part 
 of this patch for those sites that would like to use this new option.
  
 Issue #4 Description
 -----------------------
 Note: This applies to DSM/VMS Sites Migrating to Cache/VMS:
  
 Existing DSM/VMS sites that are migrating to Cache/VMS should replace 
 their existing HL7 TCP/IP services to new ones that match their new Cache 
 environment.

 General Installation Instructions (All sites):
 ==============================================
 Note:  This addresses issue #1
  
 Warning: After installation of this patch, Cache/VMS sites will no longer 
          have the capability of starting their multi-listeners through the
          HL7 options; therefore, Cache/VMS sites must immediately create
          and enable their multi-listeners as TCP/IP services, as described
          in the 'Special Instructions for VMS Sites that Use TCP/IP
          Services' section below.
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  VMS SITES: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
        routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they
        should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers, and
        the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options
        listed below:
  
          Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
          TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
        VMS SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 TCP/IP services for this
        installation.
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your
        system. The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport
        global. To do this, use the 'Installation [XPD INSTALLATION 
        MENU]' menu.  You should use each of the following 'Installation'
        menu options in the order shown below:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
  
        When using the 'Install Package(s)' menu option to install 
        the patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The 
        questions asked, and the answers you should supply, are 
        shown below.
  
          INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*84>
          Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols?  <NO>
  
    6.  For VMS sites: Follow the steps for 'Special Instructions for VMS 
        Sites that Use TCP/IP Services' below; then, continue with the rest
        of the steps here.
  
    7.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
        VMS Sites:  If you previously disabled an HL7 TCP/IP service for 
        this installation, you may enable it now.
  
    8.  VMS Sites:  After the patch has been installed, rebuild your
        map set, if necessary.
  
    9.  Start Link Manager using the 'TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL
        START/STOP LINK MANAGER]' menu option. 
  
   10.  The above steps complete resolution of issue #1
