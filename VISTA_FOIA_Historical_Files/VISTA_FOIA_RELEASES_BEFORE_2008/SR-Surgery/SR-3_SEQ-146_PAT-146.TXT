Description:
============

 1. At many sites the Risk Assessment Nurse Reviewers are involved with the 
 Health Information Management Systems (HIMS) staff in determining the
 final codes for a Surgery case. An Alert Coder Option will allow the Risk
 Assessment Nurse Reviewer to alert the coder if there is a question on the
 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or International Classification 
 of Diseases (ICD) codes on a Surgery case.
  
  o The new Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option
    will appear on both the Non-Cardiac Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) 
    [SROA ENTER/EDIT] and Cardiac Risk Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) 
    [SROA CARDIAC ENTER/EDIT] menus.
  o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
    not check the PFSS On/Off switch.
  o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
    display basic surgery case information including Patient, Case Number,
    Surgery Date, and Procedure.
  o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
    display the following coded information:  the PRINCIPAL CPT CODE, OTHER
    CPT CODE, and PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS CODE.
  o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
    allow the Reviewer to enter a free text comment field to send coding
    concerns to the coder, as well as to members of a predefined mail group
    identified in the CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP parameter.
  o Values for the CODING COMPLETED BY field (#.01) of the CODING 
    COMPLETED BY multiple (#136.011) of the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
    CODES file (#136) or the CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP will be present when the
    user selects the Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE]
    option. If neither are valued, the user will be notified that the
    message cannot be sent without one of these two items defined.
  o The CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP field (#43) is added in the SURGERY SITE
    PARAMETERS file (#133) to allow the site to create a designated mail
    group for the Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE]
    option.
  o The Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SROPARAM] option within
    the Surgery Package Management Menu [SRO PACKAGE MANAGEMENT] option is 
    modified to allow entry and editing of the new CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP.
  
 2. When creating a request from a waiting list entry, the Surgery screen 
 server incorrectly displays "SCHEDULING" in the screen header. This patch 
 makes a modification to display "REQUEST" instead.
  
 3. This patch corrects problems with the two trigger cross references that
 were added to the SITE field (#.01) of the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file
 (#133) by patch SR*3*150.
  
 Note: This patch includes a post-installation process that updates each
       entry in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) as follows:
        - UPDATES TO PCE field (#18) is set to ALL CASES.
        - ASK CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS field (#19) is set to YES.  
       The post-install routine (SR146UTL) is deleted automatically by the
       KIDS installation process.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed with Surgery users off the system.
 Installation takes less than two minutes. Installation of this patch
 may be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*146):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*146.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of

  9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
