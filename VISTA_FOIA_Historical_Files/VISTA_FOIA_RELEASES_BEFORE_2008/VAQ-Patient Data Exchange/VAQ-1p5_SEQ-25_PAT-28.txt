  Installation Instruction:
  ========================
  1. This patch can be loaded with users on the system.

  routines are NOT in your mapped routine before proceeding and rebuild
  your map set afterward before reactivating TaskMan.

  will load the KIDS package into your system.
   
   
  4. The patch has now been loaded into a transport global and you will
  use KIDS to install the transport global.  On the KIDS menu, under the
  'Installation' menu, use the following options
