Description: 
============

 This patch contains the following enhancements and fixes the following
 problems:
     
  1) ABS    *..Abstracting/Printing ...
        AI     Complete Abstract  (or)  EE     Abstract Edit Primary
     
     The Patient Care Evaluation Studies of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and
     Colorectal Cancer have been added in the AI (or EE) option under the
     ABS menu.  If the primary selected for editing matches the criteria
     for Patient Care Evaluation Studies, the user will be allowed to
     add/edit the Patient Care Evaluation for that particular primary.
         
  2) FOL *..Follow-up Functions...
        RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up
     NOIS WAS-1095-20350  FOL...RF...RETURNS TO RF AFTER ENDING
     NOIS LIT-0197-71226  Option Being Invoked Inappropriately
     
     If the user selected the "RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up" option and
     then selected the "PF Post/Edit Follow-up" option, the "RF Recurrence/
     Sub Tx Follow-up" option would again be invoked at the end of the "PF
     Post/Edit Follow-up" option.  This has been fixed.
     
  3) CTY (160,.12) DESCRIPTION
     NOIS LIT-0197-71657  CTY (.12), File 160, Computed Field Results Invalid
     
     The DESCRIPTION for the CTY field incorrectly stated that it returned
     the patient's "city".  It returns the patient's "county".  This has
     been corrected.    
     
  4) The following changes were made to the ACOS NUMBER file (160.19):
     
     a) The file name has been changed from ACOS NUMBER to FACILITY.
     b) The field name HOSPITAL NAME (.02) has been changed to NAME.
     
     In accordance with these changes:
     
     -The MENU TEXT for the "Enter/Edit ACOS Number file" option [ONCO
      UTIL-EDIT ACOS FILE] has been changed to "Enter/Edit Facility file".   
     
     -The SYNONYM for this option has been changed from AC to FA.
     
  5) NOIS WAS-1095-20372  ABS...AI...XRT TO CNS (LUNG/LEUKEMIA)
     
     Leukemia primaries were not being prompted for RADIATION THERAPY TO
     CNS (165.5,52.2).  They were being incorrectly "stuffed" with a
     value of 9 (Unknown/NA).  This has been fixed.
     
  6) LARYNX DESCRIPTION
     
     One of the CODE/DESCRIPTIONs (164.5,4) in the LARYNX record of the
     SEER CODE SET (164.5) file was misspelled as "One inpsilateral >3-6 cm".
     This has been corrected.
       
  7) ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5) FIELD NAME CHANGES
     
     The following fields have had their field names changed:
     
          Old name                       New name     
     
     330 INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM          INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM (BLA)
     400 FAMILY HISTORY OF THYROID CA   HISTORY OF THYROID CA (FAM)
     421 CT SCAN OF CHEST (THY)         CT SCAN OF CHEST
     616 INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM (IVP)    INTRAVENOUS PYELOGRAM (PRO)
     618 MRI                            MRI (PRO) 
     
     Field 400 was changed in order to make it consistent with the other
     "family history of cancer" fields.
     
     Field 421 was changed in order to allow this field to be shared by
     both the Thyroid and Colorectal Cancer PCE Studies.
     
     Fields 330, 616 and 618 were changed in order to avoid confusion
     with other fields with similar names.
     
  8) SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA PCE
     
     In TABLE III of the SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA PCE the user was unable to
     "jump" to the CLINICAL STAGED BY prompt.  This has been fixed.
     
  9) FOL *..Follow-up Functions...
        RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up
     
     The following logic changes have been made:
     
     If TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (165.5,71) is not 40 (Distant),
        then DISTANT SITE 1 (165.5,71.1),
             DISTANT SITE 2 (165.5,71.2),
             DISTANT SITE 3 (165.5,71.3) will be "stuffed" with 0 (None).
     
     If DISTANT SITE 1 = 0 (None)
        then DISTANT SITE 2 and DISTANT SITE 3 will be "stuffed" with 0 (None).
     
     If DISTANT SITE 2 = 0 (None)
        then DISTANT SITE 3 will be "stuffed" with 0 (None).
     
     The same logic will be used for the DISTANT SITE fields in the SUBSEQUENT
     RECURRENCES multiple (165.5,72).
     
 10) NOIS WAS-0297-21211  COLON LYMPH NODES N2 CODE INCORRECT
     
     The following ICDO TOPOGRAPHY (164) entries had incorrect CLINCIAL N
     (165.5,37.2) and PATHOLOGIC N (165.5,86) N2 values.  The N2 values
     were changed from "METS IN MORE THAN 4 PERI-COLIC/RECTAL LN" to "METS
     IN 4 OR MORE PERI-COLIC/RECTAL LN".
     
     C18.0  COLON, CECUM
     C18.1  APPENDIX
     C18.2  COLON, ASCENDING (RIGHT)
     C18.3  COLON, HEPATIC FLEXURE
     C18.4  COLON, TRANSVERSE
     C18.5  COLON, SPLENIC FLEXURE
     C18.6  COLON, DESCENDING (LEFT)
     C18.7  COLON, SIGMOID
     C18.8  COLON OVERLAP
     C18.9  COLON NOS
     C19.9  RECTOSIGMOID JUNCTION
     C20.9  RECTUM NOS
     
 11) ICDO TOPOGRAPHY IDENTIFIERS
     
     The fields CODE (164,1) and ICDO-1 CODE (164,.09) are identifiers
     in the ICDO TOPOGRAPHY (164) file.  These identifiers were displaying
     twice with duplicate information.  This has been fixed.
     
 12) DATE FIELDS SORTING INCORRECTLY
     NOIS WNY-1196-10305  CAN'T SORT ON CERTAIN DATES
     
     The following date fields were sorting incorrectly.  They were sorting by
     month/day/year instead of year/month/day.  These fields were defined as
     COMPUTED but their data types should have been a combination of COMPUTED
     and DATE/TIME.  FileMan did not recognize these fields as dates and
     sorted them as alphanumeric values rather than date values.  These fields
     are now defined as both COMPUTED and DATE/TIME.  All of the associated
     print templates which contain these fields were also modified to
     accommodate this change.
     
     ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (160)
     
     3     DOB
     16    DATE LAST CONTACT
     29.1  DOD
     33.1  SUSPENSE ADMIT DATE
     33.2  SUSPENSE DISCHARGE DATE
     34.1  LAST ADMIT DATE
     34.2  LAST DISCHARGE DATE
     
     ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (165.5)
     
     200   DATE LAST CONTACT
     
     NOTE: Since FileMan is now handling the output formatting for these
     fields, these fields will be displayed in the "MAR 10, 1997" format
     instead of the "03/10/97" format when using the CPR option.  If you
     wish to use the mm/dd/yy format, use the NUMDATE function.
     
     e.g.
     THEN PRINT FIELD: NUMDATE(DOB) or NUMDATE(#3)
     
 13) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
        EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c)
     
     If the primary selected had a Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) attached
     to it the following prompt would appear:
     
     "Print PCE data attached to this primary? N//"
     
     Even if the user responded "YES", the PCE would not print.  This has 
     been fixed.
     
 14) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...
        FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ...
           AC Add Patient Contact
     NOIS BUF-0394-10143  ONCOLOGY CONTACT FILE PROBLEM
     
     When adding patient contacts, if the D-NAME OF DESIGNEE field (2,.341)
     contains only the first name of the designee (e.g. "MARY"), the Guardian
     contact would be added to the CONTACT file (165) as ",MARY".  In these
     instances the patient's last name will now be concatenated unto the front
     of the D-NAME OF DESIGNEE value (e.g. "SMITH,MARY").  
     
 15) New STAGED BY field (165.5,40.2)
     
     A new computed field, STAGED BY, has been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY
     file.  The value of this field will be either the STAGED BY (CLINICAL
     STAGE) (165.5,19) or STAGED BY (PATHOLOGIC STAGE) (165.5,89) value 
     depending on which takes precedence in accordance with the hierarchy
     rules.
     
 16) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...
        FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ...
           PL Print Follow-up Letter
     
     The following FOLLOW-UP FORM LETTER (165.1) forms were not properly
     displaying the patient's list of primaries.  In the spot allocated for
     this data the text "|ONCOLOGY PRIMARY|" would display.  This has been
     fixed.  A new computed field, ICD0-TOPOGRAPHY LIST (160,49), has been
     added.

 17) SYSTEMIC SYMPTOMS
     
     Stages for lymphomas can be subdivided into "A" and "B" categories,
     "B" for those with defined systemic symptoms and "A" for those without.
     This information is recorded in the LYMPH NODES (165.5,31) field but
     was not being displayed with the stage data.  Systemic symptoms suffixes
     will now be concatenated onto the CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (165.5,38) and
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP (165.5,88) values.  e.g. I (A) or II (B).
     
 18) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing
        MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts
           3 Complete Abstract 132c/QA
              6 QA-10% Completed Abstracts
     NOIS ASH-0497-30258  10%QA REPORTS WILL ONLY SELECT ONE RECORD
     
     The above option was not returning the correct number of completed 
     abstracts.  This has been fixed.
     
 19) NOIS WAS-0497-21669  MISSING STAGE GROUP
     
     Primaries with a DATE DX (165.5,16) value prior to 1988 are 1st
     and 2nd edition cases and are not eligible for automatic staging.
     These cases were being bypassed by automatic staging but were not
     being prompted for CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (165.5,38) or PATHOLOGIC
     STAGE GROUP (165.5,88) to allow for manual staging.  This has been
     fixed.  Primaries which meet this criteria will now display the
     following message prior to prompting for CLINICAL STAGE GROUP and/or
     PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP.
     
     "DATE DX prior to 1988.  Automatic staging unavailable."
     
 20) PEDIATRIC STAGING
     
     The following modifications have been made to include pediatric staging:
     
     a) New fields were added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5) file:
        849  TYPE OF STAGING SYSTEM (PED)
        850  PEDIATRIC STAGE
        851  STAGED BY (PEDIATRIC STAGE)
     
        These fields will be prompted for in the abstract template if the
        AGE AT DX (165.5,4) value is less than 22. 
     
     b) New pediatric stage values were added to the AJCC STAGE GROUP
        (164.45) file:
     
        IIID
        IVS
        V
        A
        B
        C
        D
        DS
     
        These values will only be selectable when answering the PEDIATRIC
        STAGE PROMPT.
     
 21) AUTOMATIC STAGING ERROR
     
     Primaries with the following ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY (165.5,20) values were
     applying the wrong staging rules and may have been staged incorrectly.
     This has been fixed.  Primaries with these topographies with a DATE DX
     (165.5,3) value greater than 12/31/91 will be automatically restaged
     by the post-install routine when this patch is installed.
     
     RECTUM/ANUS/CANAL OVERLAP (C21.0)
     CERVIX, ENDOCERVIX        (C53.0)
     SINUS, ACCESSORY OVERLAP  (C31.8)
     
 22) EDIT CHECK ON ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5) DATE FIELDS
     
     A cross-field edit check has been added to most date fields in the
     ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file.  This edit check will ensure that these dates are
     greater than or equal to the DATE DX (3).  If the user enters a date
     which is earlier than the DATE DX, the following error message will
     display:
     
     "*** RADIATION DATE MUST BE GREATER THAN/EQUAL TO DATE DX ***"
     
     An edit check was also added to the DATE DX field that will require it to
     be before or equal to most existing date fields.  Violations of this
     check will result in the following error message:  
     
     "The DATE DX must be BEFORE or EQUAL to all other date fields.  The date
      entered is unacceptable because it is AFTER the following date fields:
     
      09/08/96 -   RADIATION DATE"
     
 23) NEW FIELDS
     
     The following new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (165.5)
     file:
     
     CANCER IDENTIFICATION
     
     123   INPATIENT/OUTPATIENT STATUS  Optional Data Set
     79    SCREENING DATE               Optional Data Set
     119   SCREENING RESULT             Optional Data Set
     120   PRESENTATION AT CANCER CONF  Supplementary Data Set
     121   DATE OF CANCER CONF          Optional Data Set
     122   REFERRAL TO SUPPORT SERVICES Supplementary Data Set
     
     STAGE OF DISEASE AT DIAGNOSIS
     
     849   TYPE OF STAGING SYSTEM (PED) Required Data Set
     850   PEDIATRIC STAGE              Required Data Set
     851   STAGED BY (PEDIATRIC STAGE)  Required Data Set
     
 24) Y PREFIX DESCRIPTOR
     
     The pathologic and clinical stage prefix descriptor of "y"
     (classification during or after initial multimodality therapy) has
     been added.  Two new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY
     PRIMARY (165.5) file for this purpose:
     
     69.3  MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (CLIN)
     69.4  MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (PATH)
     
     These fields are "YES/NO" fields.  Answering "YES" to these prompts will
     result in the "y" prefix being added to the TNM string.  e.g.
     
     MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (CLIN): Yes// 
     CLINICAL T: T1 INV SUBEPITHELIAL CONN TISSUE 
     CLINICAL N: N1 2 cm OR LESS, SINGLE 
     CLINICAL M: M1 DISTANT METASTASIS 
     
             Computed CLINICAL STAGE GROUP: IV (yT1m3 N1 M1)
     
 25) LYMPH NODES, HEAD & NECK (C77.0) LATERALITY
     
     Primaries with an ICDO-TOPGRAPHY (165.5,20) value of LYMPH NODES, HEAD
     & NECK (C77.0) were having their LATERALITY (165.5,28) fields incor-
     rectly "stuffed" with 0 (Not a paired site).  This has been fixed.
     
 26) NOIS WAS-0597-22440  SUMMARY STAGE FOR IN SITU BEING SKIPPED
     
     If the HISTOLOGY (165.5,22) behavior code was either 2 or 6 (e.g.
     8140/2 or 8140/6), the SUMMARY STAGE (165.5,35) field was being skipped
     in the input template.  This has been fixed.
     
 27) STA *..Statistical Reports ...
        SU Survival Routines
     NOIS ATG-0394-30013  NO QUEUE FOR STA,SU
     
     There was no "DEVICE" prompt for this report.  The output would print
     immediately to the screen.  This has been fixed.
     
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
 The following NOIS calls have been fixed by this patch:
     
     BUF-0394-10143  ONCOLOGY CONTACT FILE PROBLEM
