Description: 
============

  DG*5.3*295 and RG*1.0*3 are required builds for patch RG*1.0*7.
   
  For existing Clinical Information Resource Network - Patient
  Demographics and Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) 1.0 sites,
  patch RG*1.0*7 should be installed immediately after DG*5.3*295.
  For all other sites, RG*1.0*7 will be installed as part of your
  CIRN PD/MPI installation weekend.
   
  This patch eliminates the AUTO ACCEPT DEMOGRAPHICS (#11) field
  in the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file as well as the data
  in this field.  The [RG MERGE] input template on this file has
  also been removed.  The Edit Merge Parameter [RG MERGE EDIT
  PARAMETER] option has been deleted from the Patient Merge
  Utilities [RG MERGE PATIENT] option on the CIRN Patient Admin
  Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN COORD MENU].
   
  This patch eliminates automatic updating of the fields listed below. 
  Differences in these fields are no longer automatically updated no
  matter where the information originates (i.e., the Clinical Information
  Resource Network (CIRN) Master of Record (CMOR) or any sharing facility
  (non-CMOR)).  The **CIRN ADDRESS DELETION** bulletin is also eliminated
  when all CIRN PD/MPI sites have DG*5.3*295 and RG*1.0*7 installed.
   
  The PATIENT (#2) file fields affected include the following.
   .111    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1]
   .1112   ZIP+4
   .112    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2]
   .113    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3]
   .114    CITY
   .115    STATE
   .117    COUNTY
   .131    PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE]
   .132    PHONE NUMBER [WORK]
   .211    K-NAME OF PRIMARY NOK
   .219    K-PHONE NUMBER
   
  If a sharing site (non-CMOR) edits and transmits a change to any
  of these fields to the CMOR, that information is placed in the
  Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER] option for review
  by the CMOR.  The edited data is identified by the "->" symbol
  to the left of the field.  The CMOR can accept or reject the
  information.  If rejected, the local CMOR data is NOT updated. 
  If the CMOR accepts the change, the corresponding fields in the
  PATIENT (#2) file at the CMOR site are updated.  In either case,
  no data updates are broadcast to shared facilities.
   
  This means that synchronization of these fields no longer takes
  place between the CMOR and shared facilities.
   
  The net effect of this patch is to change the previous "Type A"
  data fields to "Type B" data fields as referenced in the "Master
  Patient Index and Patient Demographic Applications Patient Data
  Review Process Workbook" (available at the following address -
  http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/VistaU/CIRN/Cirn.htm).
   
  Updating of these data elements is stopped until specific business
  rules are established and endorsed by the Health Information
  Management Program (HIMS) office, Health Administration Services
  (HAS) office and the Patient Information Management System (PIMS)
  Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) Council
  to support updating.
   
  The only PATIENT (#2) file field that is automatically updated,
  from any source (CMOR or non-CMOR), is the NAME (#.01) field.
  Changes to the following fields, used by the Master Patient
  Index (MPI), continue to be broadcast to sharing sites by the
  CMOR via Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER].
   .02     SEX
   .03     DATE OF BIRTH
   .09     SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
   .2403   MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME
   
  Changes to the following fields will no longer be broadcast to
  sharing sites by the CMOR.
   .05     MARITAL STATUS
   .111    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1]
   .1112   ZIP+4
   .112    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2]
   .113    STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3]

  This patch addresses the following NOIS messages.  MAC-0400-60880,
  CLL-0500-42505 and SPO-0500-50886.  All deal with the issue of
  address updates.
   
  Feedback from the field will generate further modifications to the
  Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION HANDLER] option in subsequent
  patches.

  Post-Install Routine RG7POST:
  =============================
  The post-install routine, RG7POST, eliminates data in the AUTO ACCEPT
  DEMOGRAPHICS (#11) field and deletes the AUTO ACCEPT DEMOGRAPHICS (#11)
  field in the CIRN SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file.
   
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 1 minute.  However, if you choose to rebuild menu trees as 
  advised, remember that this can be time consuming.
   
  1.  For existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites, patch RG*1.0*7 should be
      installed immediately after DG*5.3*295.  For all other sites,
      RG*1.0*7 will be installed during your CIRN PD/MPI installation
      weekend.  In either case, if you have not done so previously, 
      you should do the following.  On the Filer and Link Management 
      Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu, use the Stop All Messaging
      Background Processes [HL STOP ALL] option to prevent bringing in
      demographic information while updating routines.
   
  2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  3.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*7).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*7.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//', respond YES, as this build deletes the Edit Merge 
      Parameter [RG MERGE EDIT PARAMETER] option.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  Place the Patient Merge Utilities
      [RG MERGE PATIENT] menu and the Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION
      HANDLER] option out of order.
   
  10. On the Filer and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK 
      MGT] menu, use the Restart/Start All Links and Filers [HL TASK
      RESTART] option to start your filers after the installation.
   
  11. Routine RG7POST can be deleted from your system after successful
      installation.
