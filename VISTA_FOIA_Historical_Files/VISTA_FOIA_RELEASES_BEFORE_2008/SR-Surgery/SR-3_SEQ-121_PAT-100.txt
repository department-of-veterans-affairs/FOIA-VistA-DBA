Subject: SURGERY ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE FOR OPERATIVE REPORTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch provides the ability to electronically sign operative reports 
 contained within the VISTA Surgery V. 3.0 application. These reports
 include the Operation Report, the Nurse Intraoperative Report, the
 Anesthesia Report and the Procedure Report (Non-O.R.). This patch provides
 the ability to view these signed reports through the Computerized Patient
 Record System (CPRS) by storing them in the Text Integration Utilities
 (TIU) V. 1.0 application. Tools provided by the TIU software will be used
 to sign and manage the electronic documents.
  
 Features provided by this patch are described in the Surgery Electronic 
 Signature for Operative Reports Release Notes and in the Surgery 
 Electronic Signature for Operative Reports Implementation Guide.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval:
 ====================================  
 Sites will retrieve VISTA software and documentation from the following 
 FTP addresses. The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first 
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly 
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY 
  
  Albany            ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov   anonymous.software

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity with
 Surgery users off the system. Patch installation instructions are included
 in the Installation of Patch section of the Surgery Electronic Signature
 for Operative Reports Installation Guide.
  
 Note: An environment check routine and pre-installation and
 post-installation processes are included in this patch. 
  
 The environment check routine SR100ENV does not perform any actual
 environment check activities. This routine contains code that is executed
 during the installation question process. The KIDS installation process
 deletes this routine automatically.
  
 The pre-installation process calls PRE^SR100UTL to delete the "ADIC",
 "AUD" and "AUD1" cross references and the associated cross reference nodes
 in global ^SRF.
  
 The post-installation process calls POST^SR100UTL to perform the 
 following tasks:
  - Deletes the SURGERY TRANSCRIPTION file (#136)
  - Sets default values for new site parameters
  - Activates Surgery tab system-wide
  - Converts cases with documents in TIU filed by the Boston Prototype
    (Class III) software
  - Creates stub entries in TIU for reports for cases completed on or after
    the date selected as the starting date for reports to be signed
    electronically
  - Moves reports for historical cases into TIU if selected
  - Sends mail message notification when post-installation process is 
    completed
