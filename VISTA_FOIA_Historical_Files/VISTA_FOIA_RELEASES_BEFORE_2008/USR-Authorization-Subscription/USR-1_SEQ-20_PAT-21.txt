Subject: ASU DATA CORRUPTION (#8930.3)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
  
 This patch provides the following change to the Authorized Subscription 
 System:
  
      1.  NOIS:  REN-0701-62329.  Data corruption in file USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP 
         (8930.3).
   
      Problem is caused when the "Change View" option is used to select 
      another user when in the ASU screen "Current User Classes".  
      When this option is used without selecting an additional user the 
      system refreshes the screen with the current user.  Since a user was 
      not entered, the call to DIC returns a -1 in the variable "USRDUZ".  
      If at that point a user chooses to add an additional ASU class to 
      the current user then the file USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP (#8930.3) is 
      updated with a DUZ of -1.
  
      Installing a new version of USRULST corrects this problem.  Also a 
      post-init routine (USRYP21) will be executed to remove all entries 
      in file #8930.3 that reference a DUZ with -1.  
  
      The post-init will display all the IENs that are being removed plus
      a total count of the IENs removed.
