Description: 
============

 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new GUI executable file.
          Installation of this new GUI is REQUIRED in order for the patch
          to function.  The new GUI MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after
          the KIDS install in order for the software to function. ***
  
  
 1.  Problem: The GUI Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Site 
     Parameters application does not perform a version check between the GUI 
     application and the CHUI application.
 
     Corrective Action: BCMA will validate the version of the GUI BCMA Site 
     Parameters application running on the client against the CHUI application. 
     The client version must match the patch number on the VistA server, 
     and if compatible, the previous GUI version will be allowed to run.
     No prior version will be allowed to run on the client. This correction
     will apply to all GUI versions of BCMA, beginning at PSB*2*19.
 
 2.  Problem: The Medication History Report, which is available by performing a 
     right-click on an order from the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL), displays 
     incorrect data for an IV medication order. This occurs when an IV order 
     contains more than one orderable item.
   
     Corrective Action: The Medication History Report will now display the 
     medication history for each orderable item contained in an IV medication 
     order.
 
 3.  Problem: A user can administer multiple patches for an On-Call medication 
     order, with a dosage form of "PATCH," without the previous patch being 
     removed.
 
     Corrective Action: For an On-Call medication order with a dosage form of 
     "PATCH," a user must first remove the previous patch administered before 
     allowing any proceeding patches to be given.
 
 4.  Problem: The administration times for a medication order that uses a 
     Day-of-the-Week schedule (i.e., MO-WE-FR@0900) do not print on the MAH.
 
     Corrective Action: The MAH will now display the administration times for a 
     medication order containing a Day-of-the-Week schedule.
 
 5.  Problem: The VDL generates displays an error if the user types special 
     characters (i.e., "^" or "?") when entering a comment for a medication 
     order.
 
     Corrective Action: Any special characters entered with comments will be  
     removed when BCMA files the comment. 
 
 6.  Problem: The option "Take Action on WS" was removed in BCMA patch PSB*2*20. 
     This option allowed the user to change the status of a ward stock IV bag.
 
     Corrective Action: The option "Take Action on WS" has been added to patch 
     PSB*2*19.
 
 7.  Problem: The new Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) bar codes contain the 
     National Drug Code (NDC) number in a new format called  "Global Trade Item 
     Number (GTIN)." The GTIN has a 14-digit data structure, which is used 
     within the EAN.UCC System for the unique identification of trade items 
     worldwide.
 
     Corrective Action: BCMA GUI will correctly read the GTIN and search the 
     SYNONYM field (#.01) of the DRUG file (#50) for a matching NDC number.
 
 8.  Problem: The BCMA GUI Due List Report allows the user to select a stop time 
     that is prior to the start time.
 
     Corrective Action: The BCMA GUI Due List will not allow the user to select 
     a stop time that is prior to the start time:
 
 9.  Problem: The MAH Report only displays the action of "Removed" for a PRN, 
     On-Call, and One-Time medication order with a dosage form of "PATCH."
 
     Corrective Action: The MAH Report will now display actions of "Removed" and 
     "Given."  for PRN, On-Call, and One-Time medication orders with a dosage 
     form of "PATCH."
 
 10. Problem: If an IV medication order has an infusing bag and becomes expired, 
     the infusing bag continues to display on the VDL, along with the other 
     available bags.
 
     Corrective Action: Available bags will not display when an IV medication 
     order becomes expired.
