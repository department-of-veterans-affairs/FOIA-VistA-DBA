Subject: SUPPORT FOR ORAL AS DEFAULT MED ROUTE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 1. In response to a patient safety issue, the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) V. 1.0 was modified to no longer always use a default in the
 medication ordering dialog. Therefore, sites are required to enter a 
 default in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). However, in support 
 of the previous business logic, a default of ORAL was not allowed. This 
 patch changes this requirement and allows ORAL as a default medication 
 route. HD0000000144208, PSI-06-063
  
 2. In order to assist sites in assigning a new default medication route, 
 a utility is provided to allow assignment of a route to multiple 
 orderable items, based on the dosage form. A new menu option has been set 
 up for this feature. The new menu option is [PSS ADD DEFAULT MED ROUTE] 
 and will be removed in a future patch. It is important that no one be
 editing the orderable items while this option is being run. Below is an
 example of how to run this option. Note: the display of the orderable item
 includes the internal entry number from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
 (#50.7).
  
 If your site needs to use this option, it must be assigned to the person
 responsible for performing it.
