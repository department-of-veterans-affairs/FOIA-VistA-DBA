Subject: COPAY BACK-BILLING 3RD PARTY INSURANCE REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch provides a report listing all back-billed patients from patch
 PSO*7*123. For each back-billed copay fill it indicates whether the
 patient had prescription insurance coverage as of the release date and/or
 billed date for the fill. If the copay charge has been cancelled since
 patch PSO*7*123 was installed, that information appears instead of the
 insurance information.
  
 If the patient had prescription insurance coverage on the billed date, 
 the copay charge is held for 90 days before going out in the patient 
 statement. If the patient had coverage on the release date, the copay 
 bills and insurance bills should be reviewed to determine if the 
 copayment charge is applicable because of possible insurance payment.
  
 If the copay charge should be credited, it can be removed by using the
 Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option.
  
 The temporary global ^XTMP("PSOCPIB3" from the patch PSO*7*123 install is
 kept for 90 days, so this report must be run within that time frame. To
 run the report, enter D ^PSOCPIB5 from the programmer's prompt. It prints
 in 80-column format and can be queued to print.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
  There are no restrictions on when this patch can be installed. Once the 
  patch is installed, the report can be run at any time by entering 
  D ^PSOCPIB5 at the programmer's prompt.
  
  Installation should take no longer than 5 minutes.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*142)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*142.
  
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to completion.
