Subject: DATA CLEANSING REPORTS FOR 6920 FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch exports a series of reports that will be used to prepare the
 data in the AEMS/MERS WORK ORDER # (#6920) file for conversion to the
 CoreFLS system.
  
 This patch adds a new menu option, Work Order # - 6920 [ENH WORK ORDER],
 to CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing Reports [ENH DATA CLEANSING] menu.
 This menu option requires the security key ENH DATA CLEANSING and 
 contains the following options:
       Compile Work Order List for Reports [ENH 6920 COMPILE]
       Summary Report [ENH 6920 SUMMARY REPORT]
       Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6920 REQUIRED RPT]
       Lookup Fields w/ Invalid Data Report [ENH 6920 LOOKUP RPT]
       Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6920 NON-REQUIRED RPT]
  
 The reports examine the following 12 fields:
      LOCATION (#3)
      TASK DESCRIPTION (#6)
      ENTERED BY (#7.5)
      SHOP (#9)
      ASSIGNED TECH (TECHNICIANS ASSIGNED Multiple) (#6920.02,.01)
      SHOP (TECHNICIANS ASSIGNED Multiple) (#6920.02,2)
      PRIORITY (#17)
      EQUIPMENT ID# (#18)
      STATUS (#32)
      WORK ACTION (Multiple)(#6920.035,.01)
      WORK CENTER CODE (#35.5)
      WORK PERFORMED (#39)
  
 If any field is empty or has invalid data, it is included on one of the 
 reports.
  
 This patch includes four reports, one summary and three detailed:
  
  1.  Summary Report - lists all the fields examined and a count of how
      many times each field is either empty or contains invalid data.
  
  2.  Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each required field in
      the WORK ORDER # (#6920) file that is empty. (A field is defined as 
      required when the empty field causes functionality problems for 
      CoreFLS.)
   
  3.  Lookup Fields with Invalid Data Report - lists each field in the
      WORK ORDER # (#6920) file that contains invalid data.
   
  4.  Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each non-required
      field in the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file that is empty. Because
      the fields are not required, they may be left empty, but populating
      these fields with data will improve functionality after conversion 
      to CoreFLS.
