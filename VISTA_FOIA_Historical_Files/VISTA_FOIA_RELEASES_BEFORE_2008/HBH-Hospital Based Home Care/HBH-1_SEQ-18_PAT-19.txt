  Race/Ethnicity Information Overview
  ===================================
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in October of 1997, issued new
  standards for capturing race and ethnicity data.  All Federal programs are
  required to be in compliance with the standards by January 1, 2003.
  
  This Race/Ethnicity change impacts HBPC as follows:
  
   -  Race & Racecomp fields become obsolete
      (HBHC Patient file #631, fields #9, #9.1 respectively)
  
   -  Race fields will be retained for historical purposes
  
   -  Evaluation/Admission Data Entry [HBHCADM] option will now display:
        "Race:  Obsolete Field  Jan 2003"
  
   -  Evaluation/Admission Data Report by Patient [HBHCRP2] option will
      display:
        "Race:  Obsolete Field  Jan 2003" 
  
   -  Above options will retain Race field placeholder in display until
      removed from Evaluation/Admission Form 3, VA Form 10-0014 to prevent
      data entry/validation issues
  
   -  No one-to-one correlation exists between the old race & new race
      definitions, so no conversion nor mapping of the old race field to
      the new multiple race fields will occur
  
   -  Race & Ethnicity Information fields will remain unpopulated until the
      veteran is asked; Health Administration Service data entry & reports
      will display 'Unanswered' until filled in
  
   -  Austin HBPC transmit record changes:
      -  old Race field will now contain X to indicate historical data; this
         is consistent with other software representation of historical race
  
      -  new Race & Ethnicity Information, with corresponding Method of
         Collection data, will be included in Austin HBPC transmit record
         when it exists; these fields being blank will not generate a data
         validation error for HBPC transmission purposes
  
   -  Race, listed under Patient Characteristics, on Austin COIN DMS 149,
      Part I report will be labeled obsolete
  
  
  The following Race/Ethnicity Information content was gleaned from Race and
  Ethnic Standards Initial Request Analysis document dated March 2002.
  
  The new available selections for race and ethnicity arranged in a two-
  question format are outlined below.  The Race/Ethnicity Information will
  be collected and stored in the Patient file (#2), which belongs to Health
  Administration Service.
  
     Answer with ETHNICITY NAME, or ABBREVIATION
    Choose from:
    DECLINED TO ANSWER       D
    HISPANIC OR LATINO       H
    NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO       N
    UNKNOWN BY PATIENT       U
  
  Ethnicity will allow 1 choice.
  
  
     Answer with RACE NAME, or ABBREVIATION
    Choose from:
    AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATI       3
    ASIAN       A
    BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN       B
    DECLINED TO ANSWER       D
    NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIF       H
    UNKNOWN BY PATIENT       U
    WHITE       W
  
  Race allows for selecting all that apply.
  
  
  Both Ethnicity and Race will prompt for a corresponding Method of
  Collection, with Self Identification being the default value.
  
     Answer with RACE AND ETHNICITY COLLECTION METHOD NAME, or ABBREVIATION
    Choose from:
    OBSERVER       O
    PROXY       P
    SELF IDENTIFICATION       S
    UNKNOWN       U
  
  ===========================================================================
  
  This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
  
      1)  Update Austin Form 3 Evaluation/Admission transmit record creation
          to obtain data from Race Information, Ethnicity Information, &
          corresponding Collection Method for both Race & Ethnicity, located
          in Patient file (#2).  APIs used to obtain data:  DEM^VADPT &
          $$PTR2CODE^DGUTL4.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMA, HBHCXMA1
  
  
      2)  Increase Austin Form 4 Visit, Form 5 Discharge, & Form 6
          Correction transmit records to 150 character fixed length records
          per Austin request for consistency with Form 3 Admission transmit
          record.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCUTL1, HBHCXMD, HBHCXMD1,
            HBHCXMV, HBHCXMV1
  
  
      3)  Race (#9) & Racecomp (#9.1) computed fields in HBHC Patient file
          (#631) are obsolete with Jan 2003 Race/Ethnicity mandate.  Data
          Dictionary Descriptions changed to:
  
            RACE (#9):
            This field is obsolete & contains historical data only (prior to
            Race/Ethnicity Information multiple field mandate in Jan 2003).
            Race field value set to "X" for Austin tranmission purposes
            after mandate.
  
            Historical Description:  This fields represents patient's Race
            in Patient (2) file.  (9.1) field to convert Race field value to
            corresponding HBHC Race code.
  
  
            RACECOMP (#9.1):
            This field is obsolete & contains historical data only (prior
            to Race/Ethnicity Information multiple field mandate in Jan
            2003).
  
            Historical Description:  This field returns the abbreviation
            field from the Race file (#10).  Used to obtain the field
            value needed for converting the Patient file (#2), Race field
            (#.06), Abbreviation field (#1 in DIC(10,) to the corresponding
            HBHC Race code field value.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHC PATIENT FILE (#631) data
            dictionary descriptions updated
  
  
      4)  Race field value set to "X" for Austin tranmission purposes to
          indicate historical race.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMA1
  
  
      5)  Display changed to: 'RACE:  Obsolete Field  Jan 2003' in
          Evaluation/Admission Data Entry [HBHCADM] option.  Field retained
          to maintain data entry sequence until VA Form 10-0014 modified to
          remove field.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCUTL1
  
  
      6)  Display changed to: 'RACE:  Obsolete Field  Jan 2003' in
          Evaluation/Admission Data Report by Patient [HBHCRP2] option.
          Field retained to maintain data entry validation sequence until VA
          Form 10-0014 modified to remove field.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCPR2
  
  
      7)  Add '11,' in routine second line of HBHCRP21, which was
          inadvertently omitted from patch list in HBH*1*13 & subsequent
          patches modifying this routine.  Checksum value does not change
          with this edit.
  
          Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP21
