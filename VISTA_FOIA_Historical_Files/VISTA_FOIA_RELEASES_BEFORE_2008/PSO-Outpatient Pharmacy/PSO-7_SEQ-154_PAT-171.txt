Subject: EDITING ANOTHER PATIENTS PENDING RX 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Description
  ===========
  
  Problem
  =======
  If a Pharmacist selects multiple prescriptions in the Patient
  Prescription option ([PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]) and one or more of these
  prescriptions are 'Pending', the possibility exists that another
  Pharmacist could have previously run the Complete Orders from OERR
  ([PSO LMOE FINISH]) option and already selected one of these orders to
  finish.  Locking on the pending order does not occur until the
  pharmacist pulls up that order to edit it. Once an order is finished,
  it is removed from the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#54.21). If the
  very last entry in the pending file is the one being finished by the
  other pharmacist, once it is removed, the next entry added to the 
  ending file will contain the same internal entry number. If this new
  entry is a new order (instead of a discontinued order or something
  else), when the first pharmacist gets to that item from his selection
  list, the information that is displayed is from the "New" order. So the
  pharmacist could unknowingly finish the prescription thinking it was
  for the patient that he is viewing on the profile. The order does get
  filed under the correct patient, just not the patient that the 1st
  pharmacist was processing. 
  
  Resolution
  ==========
  This patch corrects this problem by verifying that the
  pending order is for the same patient that the pharmacist
  is viewing.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
 
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7*171) 
  
      a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
      b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
      c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      d. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7*171.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
