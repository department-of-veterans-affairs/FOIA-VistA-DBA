Subject: PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2 ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will be 
  used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
  writes to the Pharmacy Data Management file. Since the PHARMACY PATIENT
  file (#55) is being replaced as part of the Pharmacy Re-engineering
  project, any direct M-based global reads or writes to this file must be
  replaced by calling the APIs provided in this patch.
  
  When the new data source is in place, the calling applications will not
  be required to make any changes. These APIs will be flexible
  enough to retrieve the requested data from the new data source when
  the time comes.
   
  If any application is making direct global reads or writes to this file
  they must be replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.
  
  Documentation for this patch was released with patch PSS*1*90.
