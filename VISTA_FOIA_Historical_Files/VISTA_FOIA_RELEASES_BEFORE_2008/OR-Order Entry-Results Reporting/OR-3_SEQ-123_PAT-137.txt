 Description:
 ===========
  
 When patch OR*3*131 (CPRS GUI V18) was released, an earlier version 
 of the CPRS.cnt help system file was inadvertently sent.  With this 
 earlier version of the file, users might encounter "Content" and "Index"
 tabs without the latest help file references.
  
 A new version of the CPRS.cnt file has been made available to local VHA
 IRM field sites via FTP.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
   
      download.vista.med.va.gov
   
 which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
   
 The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
 location at the following locations.
    
      Hines           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Albany          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
 Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
