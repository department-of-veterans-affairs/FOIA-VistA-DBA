      reports. Current formatting does not provide usable information

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 HIN-0903-40944
  
 Problem:
 --------
   Problem 1:
      Lab  Data Summary: If Print Summary Only is answered "No", the
      Laboratory Statistics Summary is followed by the Laboratory
      Data Summary.  The sort order of the Laboratory Data Summary 
      makes it unusable as a hard copy report.
  
      Resolution: Exclude the Laboratory Data Summary from the hard copy  
      (printed) reports. This data will not print for any output device     
      sub-type that starts with a "P", and is not a P-Message.
  
   Problem 2:
      Outpatient Statistical Data: When generating a hard copy of this data,
      only the last division defined is included in the report.
  
      Resolution: All divisions will be included in the report.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
     [XPD MAIN]:
  
           Edits and Distribution...
           Utilities...
           Installation...
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSU*3.0*32):
  
     a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global. 
     b.  Print  Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.  
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will  
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all componenets of the patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
         of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup  
         any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSU*3.0*32.
  
     a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO.
     b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
     c.  When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of 
         order, enter the following:
  
              PSU PBM AUTO       Automatic Pharmacy Statistics
              PSU PBM MANUAL     Manual Pharmacy Statistics
  
 6.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
