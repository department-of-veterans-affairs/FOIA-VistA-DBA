Subject: MED ROUTE DISPLAY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct PSI-06-158
  
 The purpose of this patch is to correct display issues found with the
 MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2) ABBREVIATION field (#51.2,1).  
 PSI-06-158 was created as a result of this display problem.
  
 This patch will also make use of 2 new fields, PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE
 IN BCMA (#8) and DSPLY ON IVP/IVPB TAB IN BCMA? (#9), which have been
 added to the MEDICATION ROUTES FILE (#51.2) by patch PSS*1*88 which is 
 being released in conjunction with this patch.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
 =========================
 HD166204 - Patient Safety Issue regarding yesterday's PSN from J. Krieg
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Iron Mountain, MI
 North Chicago, IL
 Oklahoma City, OK
 Upstate New York, NY 
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When the ABBREVIATION field (#51.2,1) of the MEDICATION ROUTES file
     contains any of the following characters in sequence "ID", "IV", "IM",
     "SC", "SQ", the user will be prompted for an injection site within the
     Bar Code Medication Instruction (BCMA) Graphical User Interface (GUI)
     application. This can cause an inappropriate prompt if, for example,
     the word "LIQUID" is entered as the abbreviation since it contains 
     'ID'.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     The NAME field (#51.2,.01) of the MEDICATION ROUTES file will now be
     passed to the BCMA application, instead of ABBREVIATION, to display on
     the VDL and Coversheet.
  
     The new field, PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE IN BCMA (#51.2,8), will be passed 
     to verify whether or not the user should be prompted for an injection
     site.  The ABBREVIATION field will no longer be the determining 
     factor for whether or not to prompt for an injection site.
  
     The new field DSPLY ON IVP/IVPB TAB IN BCMA? (#51.2,9) will now be
     passed to the BCMA application to determine if an order should be  
     displayed on the IVP/IVPB tab. This will eliminate the requirement to 
     define Medication Routes with an abbreviation of "IVP" or a name of
     "IV PUSH".
