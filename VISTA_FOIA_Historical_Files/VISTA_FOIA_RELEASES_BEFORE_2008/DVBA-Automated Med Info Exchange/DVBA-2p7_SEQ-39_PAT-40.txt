Subject: AMIE [DVBA C ENTER C&P REQUEST] option deletes patients from Patient   File

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. When issuing an AMIE C&P exam request if the patient the request is being
    issued for is not in the Patient File the application will enter the 
    patient into the Patient File(2) and the IVM Patient File(301.5) then 
    proceeds to collect the additional information needed for the request.  
    When the request is issued without all of the required information or if 
    the application times out, the application will delete the patient from 
    the Patient File(#2) and the IVM Patient File(301.5). These deletes are 
    accomplished with the DIK File Manager call, at this point these
    deletes cause broken pointers. These deletes will be removed and a 
    error message will be displayed on the screen, the C&P Request will be 
    aborted. The new patient entered in the Patient File and IVM Patient 
    File will remain.

 2. The AMIE C&P exam request uses a compiled Input Template to collect
    additional required Patient data for the request. Whenever a change to any
    field in the compiled Template occurs, the template has to be recompiled.
    If a field change occurs and the Template is not recompiled the possibility
    of the compiled code not being in sync with the current code exists.
    The Input Template 'DVBA C ADD 2507 PAT' will be un-compiled to avoid this
    possibility.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
  to users.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.]
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*40):
  
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*40.
