Subject: LABEL PRINTING PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 After installing patch PSO*7*107, some sites have reported problems in 
 printing labels, notably when there are bar codes in the label. In patch
 PSO*7*107, we replaced the carriage return control code *13 with $C(13) to
 make it vendor independent. The problem is that the $C(13) under DSM/VMS
 does not initialize the column position to zero. This patch fixes this
 problem.
  
 Please note: This patch and the associated patch PSO*7*107 are not
 compatible with class 3 software for automated dispensing machines such as
 Baker 2000, etc. If your site is using any class 3 software, please get
 the corrections for these dispensing machines before installing this
 patch.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not

 Installation will take no longer than 3 minutes. There are no scheduling
 restrictions or recommendations. 
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should

       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
