Subject: PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address two issues:
 1.  Patient Instructions shows incorrectly when using edit prescriptions 
 option.
 2.  Reinstating discontinued clozapine drug problem.
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 REMEDY HD149502
  
 Problem 1:
 You have 2 patients each with 1 active order and something entered in
 field 4 (patient instructions).  Using Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT] 
 option, choose 1st patient and 1st Rx and edit field 4, then immediately
 go to 2nd patient and 2nd Rx and now try to delete field 4.  What happens
 is the display to the right of the "@" sign incorrectly shows the patient
 instructions that were entered for the 1st patient.  While this
 information does not get saved, it actually could be misleading to the
 users.
  
 Also, do above testing another way. Choose 2 prescriptions, one active 
 from different patients.  Perform a speed entry input, by entering the 
 multiple prescription numbers with a comma between the two numbers.
  
 Solution:
 With this patch installed, it will not display the patient instructions 
 for the first patient when you are about to delete the patient 
 instructions for the second patient.
  
 REMEDY 147655
 Problem 2: Reinstate Issue:
 When you have 2 Clozapine drugs ordered, one as active and one as 
 discontinued, you wish to reinstate the discontinued drug.  At this point 
 the active drug will incorrectly become discontinued when you have 
 decided to "^" out of the application
  
 Solution:
 With this patch installed, the active drug will remain as active and the 
 discontinued drug will stay as discontinued.
