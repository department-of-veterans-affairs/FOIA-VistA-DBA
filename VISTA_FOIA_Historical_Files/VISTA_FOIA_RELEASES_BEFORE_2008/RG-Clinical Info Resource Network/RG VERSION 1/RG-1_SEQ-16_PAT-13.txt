Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*9 and RG*1.0*11 are required builds for patch RG*1*13.
  
  Instructions in patch XM*DBA*144 must be followed prior to
  installing patch RG*1*13.  XM*DBA*144 is an informational patch
  with directions for opening the MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV domain.
   
      NOTE: The environment check routine, RGP13ENV, will ensure
      that the MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV domain is correctly set up before
      allowing RG*1*13 to be installed.  You may wish to review
      the data in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file for the MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV
      domain prior to installation of RG*1*13.
         DOMAIN NAME: MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV
         FLAGS (#1) field: Should be set to "S"
         TRANSMISSION SCRIPT  (multiple) (#4): TCP/IP
            NETWORK ADDRESS (MAILMAN HOST) (#1.4): 152.125.191.142
            OUT OF SERVICE (#1.5): Should NOT be out of service.
    
  This patch adds a new code to the ACTION (#2) field of the CIRN HL7
  EXCEPTION TYPE (#991.11) file, the new code being 3 for MPI EXCEPTION
  HANDLER.  Exceptions of this type will be sent to the MPI Exception
  Handler at the Austin MPI.  Previously these exceptions were sent to
  the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD) team on FORUM
  via the local MPIF EXCEPTIONS Mail Group. The post-install routine for
  this patch will change the action of those exception types to MPI
  EXCEPTION HANDLER. The new server functionality on the Austin MPI will
  provide a better means for the MPI/PD team to manage the exception
  messages.
