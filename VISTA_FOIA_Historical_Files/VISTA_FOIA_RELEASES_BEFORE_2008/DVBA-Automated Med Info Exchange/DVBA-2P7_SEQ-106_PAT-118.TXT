 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD172233 - Updates for 4 AMIE Worksheets:  Audio, Ear disease, Eating
            disorders and Mental disorders
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to 4
    current AMIE Compensation and Pension (C & P) Examination worksheets:
    Audio (#1305), Ear Disease (#1310), Eating Disorders [Mental Disorders]
    (#0915) and Mental Disorders [except PTSD and Eating Disorders]
    (#0905).
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    a) Created post-install routine DVB118PI, which will deactivate the
       current worksheets in the AMIE Exam file (396.6) and activate the
       new worksheets in file 396.6.  The current Internal Entry Numbers
       (IEN) for these worksheets are: 183 (Audio), 163 (Ear Disease),
       175 (Eating Disorders) and 178 (Mental Disorders).  The new IENs
       will be: 202 (Audio), 203 (Ear Disease), 204 (Eating Disorders) and
       205 (Mental Disorders).
    b) Created routine DVBCWAU5 which will contain the new text for the
       AMIE Audio C&P Exam worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWAU4 which will
       access the text routine and print the worksheet.
    c) Created routine DVBCWER3 which will contain the new text for the
       AMIE Ear Disease C&P Exam worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWER2 which
       will access the text routine and print the worksheet.
    d) Created routine DVBCWEA5 which will contain the new text for the
       AMIE Eating Disorders (Mental Disorders) C&P Exam worksheet.
       Created routine DVBCWEA4 which will access the text routine and
       print the worksheet.
    e) Created routines DVBCWME7 and DVBCWME8 which will contain the new
       text for the AMIE Mental Disorders (except PTSD and Eating
       Disorders) C&P Exam worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWME6 which will
       access the text routines and print the worksheet.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVB118PI, will create 4 new records
 in the AMIE Exam file (396.6) for the 4 AMIE worksheets described above
 and inactivate the existing records for those same 4 AMIE worksheets.
 This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical purposes.  The 5th
 piece of the existing records will be updated with an "I", to indicate
 Inactivate.  The 5th piece of the new records will contain an "A",
 indicating Active.
