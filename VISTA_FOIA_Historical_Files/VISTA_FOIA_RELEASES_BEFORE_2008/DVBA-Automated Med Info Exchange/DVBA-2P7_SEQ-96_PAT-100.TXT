Subject: FIX MISC CAPRI REPORTING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects two issues:
  
     1. The CAPRI GUI version of the "BATCH 2507 REPRINT" will produce a
        "No data found for requested report criteria." message, while the
        AMIE version produces the correct results.
  
     2. The CAPRI GUI version of the "Discharge Report" will produce a
        "No data found for requested report criteria." message, while the
        AMIE version produces the correct results.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000100742 - CAPRI Batch 2507 Re-Print Report Not Working
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Sites are reporting that they are getting the message "No data found
     for requested report criteria." when attempting to run the CAPRI
     version of the 'Re-Print C&P Final Report(s)' option.  While the 
     option does not work in CAPRI, it does work correctly in AMIE.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  The DVBAB82 routine is checking to verify that a patient is valid 
         before the report will run.  The CAPRI version is only ran by 
         date (rather than veteran) so this check does not need to be done.
         Since no patient ID is being passed to the RPC, the report is 
         erroring out.
  
  
 HD0000000131120 - CAPRI Discharge Report Not Working
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Sites are reporting that they are getting the message "No data found
     for requested report criteria." when attempting to run the CAPRI
     version of the 'Discharge Report' option.  While the option does not
     work in CAPRI, it does work correctly in AMIE.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     a)  The DVBAB53 routine is calling the %ZIS utility which is causing 
         the device prompt to come up. Being the RPC is a background job, 
         the M read command (which accepts keyboard input from a user) is
         failing and code execution stops there.  The call to %ZIS is not 
         needed therefore the line of code will be commented out.
