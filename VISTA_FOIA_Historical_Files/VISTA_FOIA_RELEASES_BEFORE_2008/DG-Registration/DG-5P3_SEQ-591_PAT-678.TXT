Subject: EMERGENCY RESPONSE INDICATOR-HURRICANE KATRINA PTF WORKLOAD REPORTING

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Chief Business Office has requested that a new Emergency Response 
 Indicator (ERI) be created and populated with a "Hurricane Katrina" 
 designation for all those that we identify as being within the known 
 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) designated disaster areas.  A
 search has been run on a backup copy of the Health Eligibility Center's
 (HEC)  production system to find those in the affected zip code regions.  
 The indicator will be populated on the HEC production system, transmitted
 to all medical centers that have seen the affected patient, and made
 available to all interested application groups (Patch DG*5.3*677).  As the
 patient moves from place to place, the indicator will follow to ensure the
 proper processing of billing, etc.  An option to enable users to manually
 set this indicator for veterans and non-veterans affected by the hurricane
 who were not identified through the automated mechanism will also be
 included in the above-mentioned patch.  In addition, the inclusion of this
 flag in workload transmissions (inpatient, outpatient, etc) to the 
 National Patient Care Database (NPCD) to facilitate workload and cost 
 capture for hurricane support will be added with these patches (DG*5.3*678
 & SD*5.3*459).
  
  
 NOTE: The software for this patch, DG*5.3*678 and associated patch
       SD*5.3*459 is not being distributed through the National Patch
       Module.  These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS
       software distribution (host file).  This patch contains the
       informational portion of DG*5.3*678.
       Please refer to the 'SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL' and 'INSTALLATION
       INSTRUCTIONS' sections of this patch description for the
       instructions on how to acquire, install, and implement the patch
       software.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to address the workload reporting for 
 inpatient and outpatient services regarding Hurricane Katrina within PTF 
 & Census transmissions to the National Patient Care Database (NPCD).
  
 PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE RE-TRANSMISSIONS INCLUDED WITHIN THIS PATCH 
 WILL NOT IMPACT CLOSE-OUT, THE REPORTING OF PTF/PCE RECORDS FOR THE 
 ALLOCATION RESOURCE CENTER (ARC) OR ANY OTHER POST CLOSEOUT REPORTING.
  
 Transmissions for Census PTF records that contain the ERI flag of 'K' 
 will start with the December 31, 2005 Census.
  
  
  
 TECHNICAL OVERVIEW - PTF & Census transmissions
 -----------------------------------------------
  
 1. Add ERI flag to the legacy PTF/Census message transmission.  The value
    of "K", or space will be transmitted in column 96 of the "101" Patient
    Demographics Segment.
  
 2. Add PTF error code 125 - Invalid Emergency Response Indicator.
  
 3. A post-install routine of patch DG*5.3*678 will perform a one-time 
    re-queue of legacy PTF messages when the associated inpatient encounter
    meets all the following criteria: 
  
    a.  Inpatient PTF records which have previously been transmitted for 
        the admissions after 8/25/05 to Austin Automation Center (AAC) will
        be re-queued for retransmission if they contain an ERI flag of 'K'.
  
  
 Additional information on this one-time re-queue process can be found 
 within the Post Installation section of this document.

 ****************** POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ********************
  
 A.  Post-Install Routine POST^DG53678A
 ==========================================================================
 1.  The Post-Install Routine for patch DG*5.3*678 makes a call to 
     POST^DG53678A.
  
     The POST entry point of routine DG53678A automatically queues a
     TaskMan task that will scan the PTF RELEASE (#45.83) file to obtain a
     list of inpatient PTF records which have previously been transmitted
     for the admissions after 8/25/05 to AAC which contain the ERI flag of
     'K' for for Hurricane Katrina. The verified patient's inpatient
     encounters will be re-released to be transmitted during the next
     scheduled transmission of legacy PTF messages to the NPCD.
  
 2.  If the re-release task begins running while a PTF Transmission is in 
     progress, the re-release task will stop. In addition, the task
     contains checks for a user-requested stop. A MailMan message will be
     created and sent to the person installing the patch indicating the
     reason for premature task stoppage.
  
 3.  To re-queue a "stopped" re-release task, re-run the POST entry point
     of routine DG53678A by entering at the programmer's prompt:
  
     > D POST^DG53678A
  
 4.  Successful completion of the re-release task results in a MailMan
     message being created containing the total count of PTF records 
     re-queued for transmission, which will be sent to the person
     installing the patch and the PTT mail group.
  
 5.  NOT ALL SITES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE RETRANSMISSION OF THE PTF 
     RECORDS.
  
     o    IF YOUR SITE IS IMPACTED PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS LISTED 
          BELOW TO RETRANSMIT THE PTF RECORDS:  PLEASE REFER TO THE 
          PIMS V.5.3 ADT MODULE USER MANUAL - PTF MENU FOR ADDITIONAL
          INFORMATION.
     o    GO TO THE PTF MENU, THEN PTF TRANSMISSION
     o    AT THE START DATE PROMPT TYPE ?.  YOU SHOULD SEE A
          LIST OF DATES AVAILABLE FOR RE-TRANSMISSION.
     o    ENTER THE FIRST AVAILABLE START DATE, THEN ENTER A THROUGH DATE
          FOR THE DATE RANGES AVAILABLE.
     o    IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU RETRANSMIT THESE RECORDS WITHIN 
          15 DAYS OF THE PATCH INSTALLATION.
  
 6.  The routines, DG53678A and DG53678P, which serves as both the
     Environment Check Routine and the Post-Install Routine for patch
     DG*5.3*678, may be manually deleted from your system after successful
     patch Installation and successful completion of the PTF re-release
     task.
  
  
 B.  Post-Install Routine POST^SD53459A
 ==========================================================================
 1.  The Post-Install Routine for patch SD*5.3*459, POST^SD53459A, 
     automatically queues a TaskMan task that will scan the TRANSMITTED 
     OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.73) for outpatient ACRP encounters
     transmitted after 8/25/05 which contain and ERI flag of 'K' for 
     Hurricane Katrina.  These records will be marked for re-transmission
     via the AmbCare Nightly Transmission process and will not require
     manual intervention.
  
 2.  If the Post-Install Routine does not automatically start the TaskMan
     task during patch installation, the task may be re-queued by entering
     at the programmer's prompt:
  
     > D POST^SD53459A
  
 3.  Successful completion of the re-queue task results in a MailMan
     message being created and sent to the person installing the patch.
  
 4.  The routines, SD53459A and SD53459P, which serves as both the
     Environment Check Routine and the Post-Install Routine for patch
     SD*5.3*459, may be manually deleted from your system after successful
     patch Installation and successful completion of the ACRP re-queue
     task.
