  Patch MC*2.3*24 is a clinical device interface system.  The interface
  allows the clinical devices listed in Table 1 to send data to the
  Medicine Package using the Transport Communication Protocol/Internet
  Protocol (TCP/IP) and Health Level Seven (HL7) data format.

  * For Medgraphics devices that use the Data Innovations (D.I.) interface,
  the Sending Facility (4th piece of the message header (MSH) segment,
  delimited by a vertical bar) will contain the string "Instrument
  Manager". The 25th piece of the observation request (OBR) segment will
  then contain the Instrument Code for that device. 
  
  For sample formats of the MSH and OBR segments, refer to the patch
  Installation Guide or Appendix A of the Medicine v2.3 Technical Manual.
