Description: 
============

 Patch AFJX*5.1*33
  
 NOIS: FNC-0103-30068
 Test Site: Fayetteville, NC
 
 If the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user has been terminated, requests that
 users make are not delivered to the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user.
 Consequently, it is not possible to print or view completed requests
 which were made after termination.  In order to remedy this, a check will
 be made of the status of the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user every time a
 user enters option AFJXNHEX REQUEST (Network Health Exchange Options ...),
 and if the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user is terminated, the option will not
 be usable.
 
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It requires patch AFJX*5.1*32.
