      Patch Installation:
      ==================
  
      Only HBPC  (Home Based Primary Care, formerly HBHC Hospital Based
      Home Care)  users need to be off the system.  Patch installation time
      will vary depending upon how much visit data there is to cross-
      reference.  (Little Rock took 11 minutes in production account.)  There
      is no recommended time of day for installation.  Additional disk space
      required for database structural change is minimal. 
  
       1.  If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.

             c.  Backup a Transport Global.
  
       4.  Use Install Package(s) option under the Installation menu, select
