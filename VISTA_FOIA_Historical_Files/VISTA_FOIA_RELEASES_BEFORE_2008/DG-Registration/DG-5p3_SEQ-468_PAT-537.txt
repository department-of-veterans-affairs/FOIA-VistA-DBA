Description:
============

 This patch distributes a new option: PTF Records Transmitted with MT 
 Indicator of U [DG PTF TRANS MT EQUAL U RPT]
  
  
 The report included in this patch is the follow up to Patch DG*5.3*512,
 which was a KIDS build released on May 29, 2003.  That patch addressed
 changes requested in an Executive Decision Memo sponsored by the VHA Chief
 Business Office (CBO) regarding Veteran Financial Assessments.  The CBO
 requested the removal of the restriction that blocked the transmission of
 inpatient episodes of care (PTF) to the National Patient Care Database
 (NPCD) if a veteran's updated financial assessment (Means Test)
 information was not complete (Means Test status equals Required or U).
  
 Due to the changes brought forth by patch DG*5.3*512, reports are needed
 to identify patients who require a Means Test and who have had inpatient
 episodes of care transmitted with a MT indicator of U.  This patch
 provides that report
  
 This new report option is called PTF Records Transmitted with MT Indicator
 of U [DG PTF TRANS MT EQUAL U RPT]. It will be added to the PTF Output 
 Menu [DG PTF OUTPUT MENU] when this patch is installed. This report
 conforms to requirements related to the VERA allocation process, where at
 least one PTF record within the Fiscal Year must include a valid Means
 Test status for the patient.  The patient will be included on the report
 only if ALL the patient's PTF records within the date range selected have
 a current MT Status Indicator of 'U'. This will focus the list on patients
 who have no valid MT status in the National Patient Care Database (NPCD)
 for the date range chosen.  The report may be printed by Previous Fiscal
 Year, Current Fiscal Year or User Specified Date Range.  The current FY is
 the suggested date range for this report.
  
 This report will print the patient's name, last four of their social 
 security number, the PTF record number, the type of record (PTF or
 CENSUS), PTF Status, transmission date and the date of death (if there is
 one).
  
 Please note: The PTF Output Menu also includes the "Means Test Indicator
 of 'U' Report".  This report was used with the 8100 error generation.  
 This report WILL NOT provide the same data as the new "PTF Records
 Transmitted with MT Indicator of U" report.  The new report should be run 
 for all reviews pertaining to transmitted PTF records.
  
 Running the report will generate a new mailman message to the user
 initiating the report.  This message will provide summary information 
 showing the start and end times for the report run, total time it took the
 report to process, how many records were scanned and how many records were
 included in the report.
