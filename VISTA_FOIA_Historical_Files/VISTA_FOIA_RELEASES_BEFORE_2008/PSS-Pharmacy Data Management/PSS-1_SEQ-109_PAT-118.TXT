Subject: ENCAPSULATION ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following changes:
  
 1) This patch allows users of the following APIs to retrieve information
 from the ORDERABLE ITEM field (#108) in the UNIT DOSE sub-file (#55.06) of
 the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) or the ORDERABLE ITEM field (#130) from
 the IV sub-file (#55.01) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). It also
 allows users to retrieve the NAME field (#.01) from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE
 ITEM file (#50.7), DOSAGE FORM field (#.02) from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE
 ITEM file (#50.7), and NAME field (#.01) from the DOSAGE FORM file
 (#50.606).  This patch adds the information listed above to the following
 APIs.
  
 * PSS431^PSS55
 * PSS432^PSS55
 * PSS433^PSS55
 * PSS435^PSS55
 * PSS436^PSS55
  
 2) In addition to the changes listed above, this patch also adds the 
 ORDERS FILE ENTRY field (#66) from the UNIT DOSE sub-file (#55.06) of the
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to API PSS431^PSS55.
  
 3) Additionally, this patch clears up an issue in DIC^PSSDI, DATA^PSS50,
 ALL^PSS51P2, and MIX^PSSDI where in rare circumstances, an error could
 occur due to incorrect API initialization.
  
 4) Also, this patch modifies AP^PSS51P1.  The modification allows users 
 to retrieve the HOSPITAL LOCATION field (#.01) and the ADMINISTRATION 
 TIMES field (#1) from the HOSPITAL LOCATION sub-file (#51.17) of the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the NAME field (#.01) from the 
 HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#42).
  
  
 5) Finally, this patch introduces the parameter PSSFREQ to AP^PSS51P1.  
 PSSFREQ is compared to the FREQUENCY field (#2) in the ADMINISTRATION 
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to filter records based on the frequency of 
 delivery.
