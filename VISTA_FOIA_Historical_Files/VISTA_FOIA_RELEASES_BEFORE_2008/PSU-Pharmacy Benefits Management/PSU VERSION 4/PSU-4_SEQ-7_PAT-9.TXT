Subject: PBM FIXES: MAPPED LOCATIONS/PHARM IEN/AMIS REPORT HEADER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following three issues:
  
 Issue #1 (REMEDY HD110830):
 Although a DA location is mapped, it is still showing up on the
 unmapped locations list in Map Pharmacy Locations (PSU MAP 
 PHARMACY LOCATIONS) option.
  
 Issue #2 (REMEDY 120880):
 For the PBM Pharmacy report (PSU PBM MANUAL ~ OPTION 4) the wrong (or no)
 finishing pharmacist's IEN is being concatenated onto the facility code.
  
 Issue #3 (REMEDY 116026):
 Monthly AMIS Summary Report Header displays wrong division name.
  
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 I. REMEDY HD110830
  
 Problem:
 Even though a DA location is mapped, they continue to show up on the list
 of unmapped locations.
  
 Solution:
 This patch will correct the file number used to create the unmapped 
 DA location report.
  
  
 II. REMEDY 120880
  
 Problem:
 The wrong (or no) finishing pharmacist's IEN is being concatenated onto
 the facility code. 
  
 Solution:
 This patch will pull the correct finishing person's IEN and concatenate 
 it onto the facility code.
  
  
 III. REMEDY 116026
  
 Problem:
 Monthly AMIS Summary Report Header displays wrong division name.
  
 Solution:
 Reset the variable holding the facility name, PSUDIVNM,
 so it contains the parent facility before it prints the report header
  
 ******************************************************
 TECHNICAL RESOLUTION:
  
 REMEDY HD110830:
 The DA locations are actually being mapped.  The code that builds the 
 unmapped locations report is looking in file #59.79002 when it should be 
 looking in #59.79003.
 _________________________________________________________________
 REMEDY 120880:
 The clinic and the finishing person IEN are only getting set for new 
 prescriptions.  The logic to set these variables needs to move from the 
 "NEW" prescription tag to the tag that sets the common variables; so they
 get set for all prescriptions.
 __________________________________________________________________
 REMEDY 116026:
 The variable PSUDIVNM does not get reset to the parent facility before it 
 prints the report header.  Code has been inserted to reset PSUDIVNM to the
 parent facility before the report header is printed.
