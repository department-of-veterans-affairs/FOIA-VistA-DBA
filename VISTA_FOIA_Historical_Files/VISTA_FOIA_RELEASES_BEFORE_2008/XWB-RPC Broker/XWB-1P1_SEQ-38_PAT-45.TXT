Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Broker Security Enhancement (in conjunction with 
 patch XU*8*404).
  
 **************************  NOTE  **************************************
         This Patch must be installed before XU*8*404.
         
 ************************************************************************
  
 The concept of a visitor signon from a remote GUI application was 
 initially requested and used by the CAPRI program. It permits Veterans 
 Benefits Administration (VBA) support personnel to access records for 
 determination of service connected status.  This type of access has also
 been used by VistaWeb and requested by other applications.
  
 This patch provides this type of access to those programs that can 
 justify its use, while increasing the security to insure that the access 
 is not used by rogue applications.
  
 A new file (REMOTE APPLICATION, #8994.5) is created by this patch.  Any 
 application using this type of access must create an entry for itself in 
 the REMOTE APPLICATION file.  That entry will contain the one-way hash 
 value for a security phrase known only to the application and the context 
 option, which users should have.  In addition, there is a sub-file 
 containing information on how to contact the authenticating server. Most 
 applications that will implement the Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) are 
 expected to have a central application server where the users will be 
 authenticated; although, VistaWeb will still depend upon authentication 
 of users at their individual home VistA sites.  The address and port number 
 for the application servers and a mechanism for connecting to them will be 
 specified in the sub-file.  The remote server will connect with the 
 authenticating server and obtain the information for the visiting user 
 directly.
   
 An application that wants to use BSE access will have to have a KIDS 
 build installed on the remote system(s) to generate the entry in the 
 REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5).  Access for entry into the file will 
 be via the one-way hash of the security phrase; thus, unauthorized 
 applications would not be able to access the systems by mimicking the 
 authorized application unless they had direct access to the security 
 phrase itself.  For more information on BSE please refer to the 'RPC 
 Broker Technical Manual' version 1.1 (file name 
 'XWB1_1P45_TECHNICAL_MANUAL.PDF') and the 'Broker Security Enhancement 
 (BSE) Supplement to Patch Description', (file name 
 'XWB1_1P45_SUPPLEMENTAL.PDF') which will be located on the Anonymous 
 Directories and on the VDL at: 
 http://www.va.gov/vdl/Infrastructure.asp?appID=23.
  
 This patch contains the following:
  
   * Four (4) M routines 
   * One (1) new REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5)
   * Three (3) pas files, if you are using the Broker Development Kit (BDK)
     to create GUI applications. These files can be downloaded from one of the
     FTP servers (see below)
  
 The Server side of this patch must be installed prior to installation of 
 patch XU*8*404.
   
 In order to implement BSE and use the RPC-Broker callback type, the central
 Authenticating VistA M server must run the RPC Broker as a TCPIP service.
 The Non-callback RPC Broker Listener/TCPIP service is distributed and described 
 with RPC Broker Patch XWB*1.1*35 and updated with XWB*1.1*44.

  Client Side:
 ============
  
 You will need to install the BDK32 from patch XWB*1.1*40, since this
 patch contains only those files that were changed for the Broker
 Security Enhancement.
  
 The following lists the files installed by unzipping the file
 XWB_1-1_45.zip into the Source file for your BDK32 installation. 
 We would recommend that a copy of the original files be saved to 
 a safe location prior to installing these files over them.
 They are shown for installation into the default directory
 (C:\Progam Files\Vista\BDK32),
 and the locations would differ for installation into another directory.
