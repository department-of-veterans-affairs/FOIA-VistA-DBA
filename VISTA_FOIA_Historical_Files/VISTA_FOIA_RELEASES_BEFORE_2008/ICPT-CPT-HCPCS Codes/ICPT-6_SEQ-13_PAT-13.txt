 5.  Sex and age range fields are added to the CPT (#81) Data Dictionary.
     Codes are populated with their associated values, blank otherwise.
     These three new fields are: AGE (LOW) field (#10.01), AGE (HIGH) 
     field (10.02), and SEX field (#10.03).  API's have not (yet) been
     modified to do Age/Sex edits.
  
 6.  The following CPT Report options have been modified to reflect the CPT
     2003 code changes implemented with this patch.
  
          New CPT Codes                         [ICPT NEW CPT CODES]
          Revised CPT Codes                     [ICPT REVISED CPT CODES]
          Recently Inactivated CPT Codes        [ICPT CPT CODES INACTIVE]
  
 7.  This patch alleviates some of the problems with the CPT Modifier
     file (#81.3).
  
     When an inquiry is made whether a specific Modifier can be used
     with a specific CPT code, the response is positive even if 
     the CPT code is inactive.
     
     API $$MODP^ICPTMOD is being changed to return a negative (-1)
     response if the CPT code is inactive.  If a date is passed as a
     parameter (the 4th), the status as of that date will be checked.
  
 8.  We recommend that Lexicon patch LEX*2.0*24 be installed IMMEDIATELY
     following installation of this patch and restoration of the 
     CPT files, to minimize the risk of translation inconsistencies.  
     Disregard this step if LEX*2.0*24 is already installed in your
     account.

 REN-0302-62641
 --------------
 It was determined that only HCPCS code A0368 should be inactive.  HCPCS 
 codes Q0081, Q0083, Q0084, and Q0085 listed as inactive in the 2002 HCPCS 
 Level II manual is a misprint.
  
 REN-0202-60669
 --------------
 The Short description of HCPCS code J9130 was listed as 'Dacarbazine 10 
 MG ing'.  According to the HCPCS Level II manual this code should read 
 'Dacarbazine 100 MG'.

 =======================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS==========================
  
 It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that this patch be installed during non-peak 
 hours.  Any packages using CPT codes should be off the system during 
 installation and restoration of the CPT files.  There may be Taskman jobs
 running that utilize the CPT globals; these jobs should be allowed to
 finish first or Taskman may need to be halted. 
  
 Installation time - approximately 30 minutes
  
  
 1.   GLOBAL SAVES OF CURRENT #81-81.3 FILES
      --------------------------------------
      It is recommended that the following globals be saved to a
      backup file in the event problems develop during the install:
  
        File Name                       Root
        =========                       ====

      ---------------------------
      NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
             NAME, enter ICPT*6.0*13):
       
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

     b. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        YES//'.
        answer NO.
  
     c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', answer 'YES'.
  
     d. When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':'

 8.  REBUILD MAPPED ROUTINE(S)  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
     ==========================
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if you 
     wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
  
 9.  Retrieve and restore the CPT globals IMMEDIATELY after completion of
     the patch installation.  Please be sure that CPT file #81 is 
     restored first.
                                                     
     The global file containing the CPT file (#81 - ^ICPT) is named
     ICPT6_13.GBL
  
     The global file containing the remaining CPT files (CPT CATEGORY
     #81.1, CPT COPYRIGHT - 81.2 and CPT MODIFIER - 81.3) is named
     ICPT6_13A.GBL.
  
     These files are available on the OI Field Office anonymous directories
     listed below.  These files MUST be downloaded in the ASCII format.
     Download the files using your FTP vendor supplied software, and
     restore your globals using their software global restore utility.

      Open-M
      ======
      It is recommended that the GUI Thin Client be used to restore the
      global.  This will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> error which usually occurs
      when using the Character-based User Interface (CHUI) ^%GI to
      restore a global saved under DSM.
  
 10.  After restoring the CPT globals, verify that the 0-nodes 
      are as follows.
  
             ^ICPT(0) = CPT^81I^107191^17613
             ^DIC(81.1,0) = CPT CATEGORY^81.1^225^224
             ^DIC(81.2,0) = CPT COPYRIGHT^81.2^1^1
             ^DIC(81.3,0) = CPT MODIFIER^81.3I^482^465
  
      Verify that the last node of the files are as follows.
  
             ^ICPT("F","Z0907",103470) =
             ^DIC(81.1,"R",865000,198) = 865999
             ^DIC(81.2,"B","CPT MESSAGE",1) =
             ^DIC(81.3,"M",8400044,8400044,427) = 30
  
 11. We recommend the Lexicon patch LEX*2.0*24 be installed IMMEDIATELY
     following installation of this patch and restoration of the
     CPT files, to minimize the risk of translation inconsistencies.  
     Disregard this step if LEX*2.0*24 is already installed in your
     account.
