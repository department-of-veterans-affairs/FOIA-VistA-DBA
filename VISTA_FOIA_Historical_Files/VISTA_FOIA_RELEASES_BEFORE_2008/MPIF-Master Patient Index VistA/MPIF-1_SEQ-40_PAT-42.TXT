Subject: MPI - HEC ENUMERATION PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Identify the primary VistA system PATIENT file (#2) entry for the
  legacy VistA system PATIENT file (#2) entry.
  
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
   
  This patch is for the Master Patient Index (MPI) Health Eligibility
  Center (HEC) Enumeration project.  This patch has no impact on VAMCs
  that have not been part of a database integration.
   
  There are approximately 29,000 patient entries, identified at the HEC
  from legacy systems, for which the primary site is not known on the HEC.
  These patients need to be identified on the primary VistA system so
  they can be added to the 1.6 million HEC patients to be assigned ICNs.
  This needs to be done prior to the beginning of the HEC enumeration.
  It is critical to the HEC that patients that have current enrollment
  be enumerated.  Information for these patients may be available in the
  NDBI POINTER CONVERSION file (#17002.2) on the primary VistA system.
   
  From the Master Patient Index (MPI), a remote request can be sent to
  an integrated facility for the identified HEC legacy patient entries.
  A Remote Procedure Call (RPC), MPIF REMOTE PRIMARY DFN ICN, on the local
  VistA system will search the NDBI POINTER CONVERSION file (#17002.2) and
  return the DFN for that entry in the primary site if it is available.
   
  Routine MPIFRPC3 supports this effort.
   
  A new Remote Procedure, MPIF REMOTE PRIMARY DFN ICN, will be added
  to the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994) as part of this patch.
   
  New Remote Procedure:
  =====================
  MPIF REMOTE PRIMARY DFN ICN
  This Remote Procedure Call will return the primary system IEN
  (DFN) in the PATIENT file (#2) along with the Integration Control
  Number (ICN) if available for a particular legacy system station
  number and DFN.
