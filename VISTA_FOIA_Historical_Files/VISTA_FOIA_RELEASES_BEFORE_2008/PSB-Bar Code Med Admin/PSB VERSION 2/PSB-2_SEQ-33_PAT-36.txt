Description:
============

 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
     executable file. Installation of this new GUI is REQUIRED in order 
     for the patch to function.  The new GUI MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY 
     after the KIDS install in order for the software to function. ***
     
     
     
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
  
 1. Enhancement: Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI
    now supports the "Required Pain Scores" during the administration and 
    "effectiveness documentation" of Pro Re Nata (PRN) medication orders. 
    This functionality must be set up in the BCMA GUI Site Parameter 
    application.  Respective PRN administration and documentation must be 
    done using the BCMA GUI application.
    
    
 2. Problem: NOIS DUB-0803-31307
    When all of a patient's active medication orders of an order type have no
    scheduled administrations within the date range of the BCMA Virtual Due
    List (VDL), the message "No Active Orders at this Time" displays.  
    This message is not accurate.
  
    Corrective Action:
    When all of a patient's active medication orders of an order type have no
    scheduled administrations within the date range of the BCMA Virtual Due
    List (VDL), the message "No Administration(s) due at this time" will
    display.
  
  
 3. Problem: NOIS NYH-0903-10598
    BCMA is not showing the correct number of PRN Reminders for patients. 
    BCMA calculates the number of PRN Reminders based on the date/time of 
    patient's transfer and not the date/time of the patient's admission.
  
    Corrective Action:
    BCMA will identify and display PRN Reminders based on the date/time of 
    the patient's admission.
  
 4. Problem: NOIS ISB-1103-31688
    The error "$ZE= NTE+16^PSBSVHL7:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable " 
    may occur when comment internal entity numbers (IEN), of the BCMA Medication 
    Log are not in sync with the BCMA Medication Log comment sub-file index.
    BCMA Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging may attempt to transmit a comment which
    does not exist, causing the error.
  
    Corrective Action:
    BCMA HL7 messaging will transmit the appropriate comment independent 
    of the BCMA Medication Log comment sub-file index.
  
 5. Problem: NOIS ISB-1103-31567 
    The BCMA Cumulative Vitals report does not display the vital changes if 
    only one measurement was changed for the designated date range. 
  
    Corrective Action: The Cumulative Vitals report will show all changes 
    that occur within the designated date range.

      available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
