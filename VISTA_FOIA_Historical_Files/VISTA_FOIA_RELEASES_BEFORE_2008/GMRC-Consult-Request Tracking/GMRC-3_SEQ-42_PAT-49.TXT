 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =====================
 1. HD0000000128119   Order Status Standardization
  
    Problem:
    --------
    During the gathering of requirements for Orders Data Standardization,
    three applications were identified that do not use the Orders API.  One
    of these applications is Consults.  Therefore, in order to support Orders
    Data Standardization a new Kernel look-up screen needs to be added to the
    data dictionary for the following fields:
  
    Consults:
  
       The CPRS STATUS (#8) field in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file. 
       The RELATED OE/RR STATUS (#1) field in the REQUEST ACTION TYPES
          (#123.1) file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new Kernel look-up screen was added to the CPRS STATUS (#8) field in
    the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file and to the RELATED OE/RR STATUS
    (#1) field in the REQUEST ACTION TYPES (#123.1) file.
  
    The new screen will not have any effect on the above fields until the
    changes associated with the Orders Data Standardization are in place.
    These changes will include a new inactivation field which will allow
    the new screen to filter out inactivated status.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 The data dictionary will be modified to include a screen and an
 explanation of said screen in the CPRS STATUS (#8) field in the
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file and in the RELATED OE/RR STATUS (#1) field
 in the REQUEST ACTION TYPES (#123.1) file.  Below are the before and after
 data dictionary values:
