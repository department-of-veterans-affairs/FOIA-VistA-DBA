Associated patches: (v)DI*22*23    <<= must be installed BEFORE `DI*22*138'

Subject: Missing equal sign FOR or SET

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
   FileMan in sort uses the letter "C" as a local variable set to a comma, 
 much like the letter "U" is set to the up arrow.  If a user was sorting on
 a field and that field has an 'Output Transform' or a 'Transform For Look
 Up' and the transform alters the "C" local variable an error will occur.
 This patch insures that "C" will be set to a comma.
