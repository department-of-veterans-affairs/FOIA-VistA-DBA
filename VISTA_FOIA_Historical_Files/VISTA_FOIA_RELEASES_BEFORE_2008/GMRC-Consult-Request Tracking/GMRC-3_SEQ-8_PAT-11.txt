Description: 
============

   This patch is covered by the VistA Y2K Moratorium Waiver, and may be
   installed before 12/15/1999 or after 01/15/2000.
  
  
  This patch introduces enhancements to the management of update users for
  services in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file. Additional fields are
  added to the file to allow individuals to be more easily assigned as
  update users or administrative users. These fields do not replace or
  eliminate any functions of the current fields in the file.
   
  The new fields added to the file affecting assignment of update authority
  are as follows:
   1) UNRESTRICTED ACCESS (#.06) is a yes/no field that will allow any user
      to update any consult directed to the service for which the field is
      set to YES.
   2) UPDATE TEAMS W/O NOTIFICATIONS (#123.31) is a multiple field that
      allows any team or personal list defined in the OE/RR LIST (#100.21)
      file to be entered. All users on all teams defined in this field will
      have full update authority for consults directed to the particular
      service. Users on lists defined in this field will not be included in
      the list of notification recipients.
   3) ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE TEAMS (#123.34) is a multiple field
      which allows any team or personal list defined in the OE/RR LIST
      (#100.21) file to be entered. All users on all teams defined in this
      field will have administrative update authority for consults directed
      to the particular service. 
   4) UPDATE USER CLASSES W/O NOTIFS (#123.35) is a multiple field which
      allows any active ASU user class to be entered.  All active members
      of all user classes entered in this field will have full update
      authority for consults directed to the particular service.
   5) PROCESS PARENTS FOR UPDATES (#.07) is a yes/no field that if set to
      YES, will cause the parent or ancestor service of the requested
      service to be checked to determine if a user has update authority for
      the parent service. This will cause all of the fields of the
      ancestor, normally used to determine a user's update authority to be
      processed. This allows update and administrative users assigned to
      one service to have authority for any sub-service having this field
      set to YES.
   
 Additional Data Dictionary changes to the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file:
  
 1) The PROCESS PARENTS FOR NOTIFS (#.08) field is added. This field is a
    yes/no field which if set to YES will cause the parent or ancestor of a
    given service to be used to determine the list of notification
    recipients.
  
 2) This ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE TEAMS (#123.34) field will have a .02
    sub-field NOTIFICATION RECIPIENTS that if set to YES will cause all
    users on the defined team/list to be included as notification
    recipients.
  
 3) The name of the ADMINISTRATIVE USERS W/O NOTIF (#123.33) field will
    have the name changed to ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USERS. In addition, the
    .01 sub-field ADMINISTRATIVE USERS W/O NOTIF will have the name changed
    to ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USER. There will be a new .02 sub-field
    NOTIFICATION RECIPIENT that if set to YES, will define this user as a
    notification recipient for consults directed to the particular service.
   
  
 This patch exports three new utility options:
   1) Determine Users update authority [GMRC UPDATE AUTHORITY] will allow a
      CAC to determine by which field in which service the user received
      update authority, if any.
   2) Determine if user is notification recipient [GMRC USER NOTIFICATION]
      will allow the CAC to determine if and by which service a user became
      a notification recipient for consults directed to a given service.
   3) Determine notification recipients for a service [GMRC NOTIFCATION
      RECIPS] will produce a list of all notification recipients for any
      selected service. The recipients will be displayed via list manager
      and may be searched, printed, etc.
   
   The Consult Management [GMRC MGR] menu option is exported in this
   patch and will contain the three new options.
   
   
  This patch exports the following Input templates: 
   GMRC SERVICE USER MGMT 
   GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE
   
   Each has been re-organized and both include new fields exported for the
   REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file.
   
   
  This patch also exports the GMRCACTM DISPLAY ACTIONS protocol menu to
  correct a problem with the Last Screen action not being available on a
  detailed display of a consult when viewed via an alert.
   
  The ADD COMMENT action has been added to the user review screen when
  reviewing consults using the Consult Service Tracking [GMRC SERVICE
  TRACKING] option. This means that all users may add a comment to any
  consult or procedure request, regardless of their update authority.
