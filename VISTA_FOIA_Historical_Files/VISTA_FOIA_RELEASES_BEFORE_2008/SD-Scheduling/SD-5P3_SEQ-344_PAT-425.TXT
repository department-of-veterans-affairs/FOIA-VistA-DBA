 Problem:
 -------
  
 1.  Cannot send report to printer unless queued:
      SDWLQOI, SDWLQSR, SDWLRQ1, SDWLRQ2
 
 2.  No kill statement for variable SDWLSPT in routine SDWLQOF
 
 3.  Calls to unsupported entry point in ZTLOAD instead of %ZTLOAD:
      SDWLRSR
      
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 1.  Modified SDWLQOI, SDWLQSR, SDQLRQ1, SDWLRQ2 to print directly to
     printer.
 
 2.  A kill statement was added for variable SDWLSPT in routine SDWLQOF
 
 3.  Modified calls to ZTLOAD to use the VA standard of %ZTLOAD in SDWLRSR.
 
 
 NOTE:  The $SELECT problem in routines SDWLROI AND SDWLRSR and the DIR read in
 ----   queued task in SDWLRPS2 were resolved in patch SD*5.3*412.
