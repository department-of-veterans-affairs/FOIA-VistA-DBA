Subject: PCE PPD SKIN TEST RESULT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch has been created to correct a problem with the PCE Encounter 
 Data Entry that when entering a PPD Skin Test result of greater than 10mm,
 it forces a positive result even though it may be negative for certain 
 patients.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 =================
 HD63061 - PPD rules are incorrect.
  
 ASSOCIATED E3R(s):
 =================
 N/A
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 ========================

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 1. HD0000000063061 (WPB-0898-32087) - PPD RULES IN THE GUI ARE INCORRECT.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 PCE forces all results of 10mm or greater to be a "positive" result even 
 though it may be negative for some patients. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A modification will be made to the routine PXCESK along with a Data 
 Dictionary change for the V SKIN TEST (9000010.12) file. The validation 
 that all results that are >10 must be positive will be removed.
