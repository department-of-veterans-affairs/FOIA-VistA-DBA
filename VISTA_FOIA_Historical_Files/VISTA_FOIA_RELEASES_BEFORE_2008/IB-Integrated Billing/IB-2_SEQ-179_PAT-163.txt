 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 1.  SHE-0501-52741       [MAS BILLING LOG] missing Run ROU DGCRMENU
 2.  CLE-0801-40457       PL in EXPAND CODE acts incorrectly
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------
 1. SHE-0501-52741       [MAS BILLING LOG] missing Run ROU DGCRMENU
    (Remedy HD #HD0000000008652)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some options became obsolete with the release of Integrated Billing
 Version 2.0. It appears that some options still exist and are attached to
 menus.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch deletes IB options that became obsolete with Integrated
 Billing Version 2.0. In order to avoid the incorrect removal of menu
 options from other menus, a pre-init process will be performed to re-index
 the "AD" cross reference of file OPTION (#19).
  
 The following options will be cleaned up if they exist:
  
   MAS Billing Log [IB MAS BILLING LOG]
   New Features of Integrated Billing [IB NEW FEATURES 1.5]
   Review Bill [IB REVIEW BILL]
   Brief Inquiry by Bill Number [IB OUTPUT BRIEF INQ BY BILL NO]
   Means Test Discharge Compilation [IB MT DISCH COMP]
  
  
 2. CLE-0801-40457       PL in EXPAND CODE acts incorrectly
    (Remedy HD #HD0000000008639)
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 It was reported users could not access the hidden option in List 
 Manager to Print List (PL) in the "Insurance Company Entry/Edit" [IBCN 
 INSURANCE CO ED] option. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The IB protocols that previously used or started with "PL" have been
 re-named.  Users will see a difference when they go to select a "plan",
 where the new naming will be "VP", for View Plans.
  
  
  
          ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
     **** Since the pre-init re-builds the "AD" cross reference of the
          option file, it is recommended that this patch be installed
          outside of normal work hours.
