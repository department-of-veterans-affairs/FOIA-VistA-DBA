 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
 ========================
 1:   HD69416   # of characters displayed
 Dup. HD118025  Critical Value List Truncating Test Name
  
 2:   HD70767   ERROR - LRCAPD2 at line EN+11
  
 3:   HD123795  Error on LRNDLST
  
  
 TEST SITES:
 ==========                                                                
 N. Cal. HCS
 Central Plains HCS
 Salisbury VAMC
 N. FL/S. GA HCS
  
  
 Problem (1): HD69416
 ===========
 The Critical Value Report currently prints the first 7 characters
 of the test name on the report. This can be deceiving as the test
 for URINE KETONES shows up as URINE K.
  
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Modify routine LRSORC1A to use the test PRINT NAME on the report.
 This will be more specific in identifying the test.
  
 LRSORC1A
  
  
 Problem (2):  HD70767
 ===========
 The Workload Code List Report errors off with an <UNDEF> error when
 an "^" is entered at the prompt "Print report sorted by:".  Also,
 when an "^" is entered at the prompt "Select local accession area:"
 the option is not exited but continues on.
  
  
 Solution:      
 ========
 Modify routine LRCAPD2 to exit appropriately when "^" is entered at
 prompts.
  
 LRCAPD2
  
  
 Problem (3):  HD123795
 ===========
 The Print List of Non-Draw Orders errors off after a couple of screens
 when printing to the screen.
  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Modify routine LRNDLST to not error off when printing to the screen.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
         to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.

       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*351'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
