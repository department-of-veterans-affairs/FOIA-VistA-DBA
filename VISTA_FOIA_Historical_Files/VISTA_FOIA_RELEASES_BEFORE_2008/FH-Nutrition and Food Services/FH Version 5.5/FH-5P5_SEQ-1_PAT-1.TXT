Subject: Change display of CC's to ML's and fixes to issues related to v5.5 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the JCAHO 2004 National Patient Safety Goals,
 specifically Goal #2 (Communication) regarding "prohibited abbreviations".
 The abbreviation "cc", which could be mistaken for "u" (units) will be 
 replaced by "ml" in all data entries and displays.  For details, go to:
    
 http://www.jcaho.org/accredited+organizations/06_goal2_faqs.pdf
    
 This patch also resolves the following NOIS calls/Remedy tickets:
    
    HD0000000090749  Problem printing diet cards
    HD0000000090067  DUB-Can't reprint diet labels
    HD0000000091362  Printing Patient Data Log
    HD0000000093126  Patient not printing
    HD0000000093813  Assistance reinstallation of patch
    
 This patch contains the following items:
    
 1) The display of "CC" has been removed from all FH options and reports and
    has been replaced by the display of "ML".  This is per JCAHO directive.
    
 2) A new Outpatient Meals report option called "Recurring Meals List by
    Location" [FHOMRL] has been added to the Recurring Meals Menu.  This
    report will display all outpatients with recurring meals for a selected
    date range, sorted by outpatient location.
    
 3) The "Bagged Meal?" prompt was removed from the "Order/Edit Outpatient 
    Meals" option, and the display was removed from the "Review Outpatient
    Meal" and "Recurring Meal Plan Expiration List" options.  The "Bagged
    meal?" prompt will now only show up only in the "Early/Late Tray" option
    and displays.
    
 4) An undefined variable error in the "Patient Data Log" [FHDMP] option
    when queueing the report to a printer was fixed.  This error was 
    reported in Remedy ticket HD0000000091362.
    
 5) An issue in which some patients were missing when running the "Print Diet
    Cards" [FHDCRP] option was fixed.  This error was reported in Remedy
    ticket HD0000000090749.
    
 6) This patch fixes an issue in which the "Reprint Diet Labels " [FHORD14]
    option would print nothing when sent to a printer.  This error was reported  
    in Remedy ticket HD0000000090067.
    
 7) This patch contains a modification to the "Diet Activity Report/Labels"
    [FHORD13] option to print the outpatient data based on the Nutrition
    events/activity instead of the actual date a meal is served.
    
 8) This patch will fix the undefined variable error at WRT+2^FHORX1B that
    some sites were experiencing intermittently when running the "Diet 
    Activity Report/Labels" [FHORD13] option.
