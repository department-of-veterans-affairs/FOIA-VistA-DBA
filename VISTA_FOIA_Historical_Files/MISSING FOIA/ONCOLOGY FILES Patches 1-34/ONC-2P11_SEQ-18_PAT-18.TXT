 This patch is available via FTP in a KIDS distribution file.  The Host 
 File ONC211P18.KID is located in the [ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE] directory of the 
 following CIO Field Offices:
  
  CIOFO    FTP ADDRESS
  -----    -----------

  Hines    152.129.1.110
  SLC      152.131.2.1
 
 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions.  
 All data dictionary changes/additions have been reviewed and approved by
 the Data Base Administrator.
     
  1) 1998 PATIENT CARE EVALUATION STUDIES
   
     The 1998 Patient Care Evaluation Studies of Breast and Prostate Cancer
     have been added.
   
  2) NEW FIELDS
   
     The following new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (#160)
     file:
   
     #48 AGENT ORANGE EXPOSURE
     #50 IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE
     #51 PERSIAN GULF SERVICE
     #52 CHEMICAL EXPOSURE
     #61 ASBESTOS EXPOSURE
 
     The default values for fields #48, #50 and #51 will be taken from the
     following PATIENT (#2) file fields:
   
     #.32102 AGENT ORANGE EXPOS. INDICATED?
     #.32103 RADIATION EXPOSURE INDICATED?
     #.32201 PERSION GULF SERVICE?
   
     DBIA #160 has been amended to include these 3 fields.
 
     These fields have been added to the PERSONAL DATA portion of the
     following reports:
   
     EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c)
     PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)
   
  3) RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE
   
     The default value for RADIATION/SURGERY SEQUENCE (#165.5,51.3) was not
     being computed correctly.  This has been fixed.
   
  4) EXTENSION (#165.5, 30) and LYMPH NODE (#165.5, 31) lists
   
     Some primaries with a lymphoma histology were not using the correct
     EXTENSION and LYMPH NODE lists.  This has been fixed.    
   
  5) NOIS MUR-0598-30086  POSSIBLE BUG IN OPTION
       Oncology Site Manager Menu
         ER Report of accessions requiring additional input
    
     The above option was displaying an incorrect year range at the
     "Select Accession Year:" prompt. 
   
     e.g. Select Accession Year: (2000-999999999999)
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  6) NOIS WNY-0798-10016  Undefined error, Registry Summary Report
       UTL *..Utility Options ...
         RS Registry Summary Reports
           A Annual
   
     This option was aborting if an ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY (#165.5,20) value was
     C99.9 UNKNOWN.  This topography, as well as C88.8 NA, were added for
     the 1997 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma PCE (Item 12. Personal History of Any
     Cancer) and should be used only for fields 1ST PRIMARY SITE (#165.5,803)
     or 2ND PRIMARY SITE (#165.5,805) of the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma PCE.
     This patch will prevent these codes from being selected at the ICDO-
     TOPOGRAPHY prompt and prevent the Annual Registry Summary Report from
     aborting.  
         
  7) SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT
       FOL    *..Follow-up Functions ...
         RF     Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up
     
     There was a problem in which the Treatment sub-fields under the
     SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT (#165.5,60) multiple could not be
     edited if the DATE OF NO TREATMENT (#165.5,124) field was set.
     This has been fixed so that SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT sub-fields
     are now editable, regardless of the DATE OF NO TREATMENT field.
     
  8) PATIENT INDEX-ACOS (132c) PRINT OPTION
       LIS    *..Registry Lists ...
         PA     Patient Index-ACOS (132c)
     
     A new column has been added to the "Patient Index-ACOS (132c)" print
     option (LIS...PA) to display the LATERALITY (#165.5,28) field.
     
  9) NOIS MEM-0598-71093  PROBLEM PRINTING PCE STUDIES
       ABS    *..Abstracting/Printing ...
         AI     Complete Abstract
         EE     Abstract Edit Primary
     
     In the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma PCE print, there was a problem in which
     the GENE REARRANGEMENTS (#165.5,837) field was printing incorrectly.
     This problem has been fixed.
     
 10) PRINT ABSTRACT NOT COMPLETE LIST
       ABS    *..Abstracting/Printing ...
         NC     Print Abstract NOT Complete List
     
     The "Print Abstract NOT Complete List" option (ABS...NC) has been
     changed to sort by the DATE DX (#165.5,3) field, from oldest date
     to most recent.  Previously this report was sorting alphabetically
     by the NAME (#160,.01) field.
     
 11) SUSPENSE LIST PRINT OPTIONS
       SUS    *..Casefinding/Suspense ...
         SP     Print Suspense List by Suspense Date (132c)
         TD     Print Suspense List by Month/Terminal Digit (132c)
         CS     Print Complete Suspense List by Term Digit (132c)
   
      
     The ORGAN/TISSUE (#160,55) and LAB MORPHOLOGY (#160,28) fields have
     been added to the 3 suspense list print options listed above.  The
     addition of these fields required that these options be changed
     from 80 character to 132 character displays.
   
 12) NEW FACILITY CODE 000000
   
     A new entry has been added to the FACILITY (#160.19) file:
   
     000000  NONE
   
     This entry may now be selected at the REFERRING FACILITY (#165.5,6) and
     TRANSFER FACILITY (#165.5,7) prompts.
   
 13) 9730/3 MYELOMA, MULTIPLE
   
     The HISTOLOGY (#165.5,22) code 9730/3 has been discontinued.  It will 
     no longer be selectable for 1998 or later cases.
   
 14) NODES POSITIVE (REGIONAL) STUFFING
   
     If the value of NODES EXAMINED (REGIONAL) (#165.5,33) is 00 (No nodes
     removed), NODES POSITIVE (REGIONAL) (#165.5,32) will be stuffed with
     98 (No nodes examined).
   
 15) DATE DX/NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURG DATE EDIT CHECK
   
     The cross-field DATE DX (#165.5,3) and NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURG DATE
     (#165.5,58.3) edit check has been removed.  This edit check prevented
     the NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURG DATE from preceding the DATE DX.  There may
     be legitimate instances where NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY predates the
     DATE DX.
 
 16) ENTERED BY (#165.5,96)
       ABS    *..Abstracting/Printing ...
         AI     Complete Abstract
         EE     Abstract Edit Primary
       
     The ENTERED BY field has been marked for deletion and removed from the
     abstract input template.  In the "Abstract Status" portion of the abstract
     this field was being stuffed with the name of the person most recently 
     accessing the primary.  It did not truly reflect the name of the person
     who had entered the abstract data.  This piece of information is more
     accurately stored in the ABSTRACTER (#165.5,92) field.  ENTERED BY will
     be deleted at a future date.   
 
 17) TYPE OF STAGING SYSTEM (PED)
 
     For patients above the age of 21, the field TYPE OF STAGING SYSTEM (PED)
     (#165.5,849) was being stuffed incorrectly.  This has been fixed.  The
     incorrect data will be converted to the correct value by the pre-
     installation routine.
     
 18) PLACE OF DEATH (#160,21)
 
     PLACE OF DEATH is currently defined as a pointer to the ZIP CODE (#5.11)
     file.  In order to make it consistent with the PLACE OF BIRTH (#160,7)
     field, PLACE OF DEATH has been modified to point to the BIRTHPLACE FOR
     ONCOLOGY (#165.2) file.  This file contains the 3-digit Geocodes which
     are listed in Appendix C of the ROADS manual.  The BIRTHPLACE FOR ONCOLOGY
     file has also been renamed GEOCODES.  The ZIP CODE pointer values will
     be converted to the appropriate GEOCODES pointer values.
