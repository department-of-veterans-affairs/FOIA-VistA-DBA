Subject: IB DSS/QUADRAMED INTERFACE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will provide interfaces to the Document Storage Systems, INC/ 
 Quadramed Claim Bill Scrubber.  
              
 All sites need to install this patch whether or not they have purchased 
 DSS/Quadramed.  Sites who have not purchased this product will not see any 
 changes in their processes or functionality.
               
 The DSS/Quadramed product supplies 3 pieces of functionality for billing:
 1.  A Bill/Claims Scrubber for the HCFA 1500.
 2.  Sequencing of CPT Codes and linking the CPT Codes associated 
     Diagnosis.  This sequencing and linkage is completed in the DSS 
     product and is transferred to the bill at the appropriate points in 
     the processing.
 3.  Creating multiple professional bills copied from an institutional 
     bill.
             
 For sites that do have the DSS/Quadramed product there will be four points 
 in the bill processing that are modified:
           
 1.  Bill Claim Scrubber:  After editing and before authorization of a bill,
     if all normal IB Edit Checks have been passed successfully, then the 
     Quadramed Claim Scrubber will be called for the bill.
     If the bill does not successfully pass the Quadramed Claims Scrubber, 
     then the bill will not be allowed to be authorized.
                  
 2.  CPT Sequencing and Diagnosis Linkage:  When PCE procedures are added 
     to a bill, the DSS/Quadramed product will be called to determine if 
     the procedures for the encounter have been processed by a coder in the 
     DSS product.  If they have been processed and the bill is a HCFA 1500, 
     then the bill's procedures will be assigned the associated Diagnosis 
     in the order defined in the DSS product.
                
 3.  CPT Sequencing and Diagnosis Linkage:  When a professional bill is 
     copied from an institutional bill, the DSS/Quadramed product will be 
     called to insert the CPT sequence and assign the CPT Codes associated 
     Diagnosis in the order defined in the DSS product.
                
 4.  Multiple Professional bills:  When a professional bill is copied from 
     an institutional bill, the DSS/Quadramed product will ask the user how 
     many professional bills are needed and then auto create those 
     professional bills.  (Without this function one professional bill is 
     created at a time.)
