Subject: FIX OP TIME FOR NON-OR PROCEDURES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   
   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   Please insure that the DSS Site Manager obtains a copy of this
   patch description.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
   Patch ECX*3*25 resolves NOIS HUN-0599-21266, which reports a problem
   in the FY1999 SUR (Surgery) extract that affects non-OR surgical
   procedures.
   
   Line STUFF+25^ECXSURG was setting the operation time for non-OR 
   procedures into the wrong piece of an intermediate data string.  This
   caused the OPERATION TIME field (#20) in the SURGERY EXTRACT file
   (#727.811) for every non-OR extract record to show "##" (meaning no 
   time could be calculated) instead of the correct number of 15-minute
   intervals.
    
   This patch corrects the error in routine ECXSURG.
    
   In addition, a post-installation conversion routine, ECX325CV, is
   included.  This routine will run automatically at the end of the 
   installation.  It will correct the OPERATION TIME field (#20) of
   each extract record in file #727.811 for all FY1999 SUR extracts
   (i.e., each record dated on or after 10/1/1999).
   
   The ECX325CV conversion routine may also be run from programmer mode
   if there is any concern that the conversion did not complete properly.
   If you wish to re-run the conversion routine from programmer mode, 
   enter the following commands:
   
   >S U="^"
   >D ^ECX325CV
   
   This conversion routine may be run multiple times without harm to
   file #727.811.
   
   Surgery extracts are normally rather small, so the conversion run
   time should be quite short.  Still, it is recommended that the patch
   be queued for installation after normal business hours.  During low
   system activity, 1000 records are processed in less than 30 seconds.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   Installation time will depend on the size of file #727.811. The patch
   may be installed with users on the system during normal business hours.
   However, it is recommended that the installation be queued for a time
   of low user activity.
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*25):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*25.
     
   6.  If you do not intend to queue the installation to run after normal
       business hours, then answer "NO" to the following prompt:
    
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
    
       If you answer "YES", then the installation will require much more 
       than 2 minutes to run due to the menu rebuild process. 
     
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
       Transmit Data from Extract Files         ECXTRANS
       Surgery Extract                          ECXSURG
   
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
   9.  After successful installation of the patch, post-installation routine
       ECX325CV may be deleted from the system.
