  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will update Integrated Billing to support the following:
 - A new Environmental Indicator of Project 112/SHAD is being created.
 - The Environmental Contaminants indicator is renamed Southwest Asia.
                                  
 The complete VistA implementation of Project 112/SHAD and Southwest Asia 
 will be released with the Enrollment VistA Changes - Release 2 (EVC R2) 
 project.  Several clinical packages will be updated for Project 112/SHAD 
 in conjunction with the release of EVC R2.
                                       
 The Integrated Billing Project 112/SHAD update installed by this patch 
 will be inactive until the clinical packages where the indicators are set 
 are updated.  Integrated Billing can not properly process Project 112/SHAD 
 care until the care is identified in the clinical packages
                                       
 The Integrated Billing Environmental Contaminants/Southwest Asia update 
 will be implemented when this patch is installed.  However the clinical 
 packages will not be updated to display Southwest Asia until the release 
 of EVC R2.  Therefore until all packages are updated this indicator may be 
 displayed as Environmental Contaminant but as Southwest Asia in IB.
                                       
                                  
 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
                                  
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested modifications to the 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) to 
 support the identification of patients and care related to Project 112 and 
 Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense) and to waive all charges for 
 that care. To accomplish this objective, Project 112/SHAD will be added to
 VistA as a new Classification for patients and care.  Care associated with 
 this Classification will not be billed to First or Third Party Payers.
                                  
 Summary of the changes to Integrated Billing to support Project 112/SHAD:
 - Claims Tracking entries for related care will be assigned the Reason Not 
   Billable of Project 112/SHAD.
 - The Third Party Autobiller will not create bills for any event with a 
   Reason Not Billable of Project 112/SHAD.
 - The First Party Autobiller will not create bills for an event related to 
   Project 112/SHAD.
 - Inpatient Admissions for a patient that has claimed Project 112/SHAD 
   exposure will be entered as an Inpatient Special Billing case of type 
   Project 112/SHAD.
 - All reports and displays will either have the Project 112/SHAD events 
   screened out or flagged.
                                  
 Implementation of Project 112/SHAD in VistA will require patches to 
 several packages to identify and properly process Project 112/SHAD care.  
 This development has been organized within the Enrollment VistA Changes 
 (EVC) - Release 2 project.
                                  
 This patch, IB*2*339, will implement the Integrated Billing (IB) support 
 for Project 112/SHAD by preventing billing of care identified as Project 
 112/SHAD related.  The identification of care as related to Project 
 112/SHAD will occur in the clinical packages.  Once the clinical packages 
 have been updated to identify care as Project 112/SHAD, then IB will be 
 able to screen that care from charges.  
                                  
 The following are the list of packages and patches IB will rely on to 
 properly identify Project 112/SHAD care:
                                  
 PX*1.0*168           Patient Care Encounter (PCE)
 SD*5.3*441           Scheduling
 DG*5.3*664           Registration 
 PSO*7.0*225          Outpatient Pharmacy
 SR*3.0*152           Surgery (released 05/31/06)
                                  
 Billing screening of care due to Project 112/SHAD will begin when these 
 packages are updated.  Note that there are more patches included in EVC 
 Release 2, but these are the patches that directly impact IB.
                                           
 Also included in the EVC R2 project is the renaming of the Classification 
 Environmental Contaminants to Southwest Asia.  This is a simple name 
 replacement, no functionality will be changed.  All reports and displays 
 in Integrated Billing will be changed to display Southwest Asia (SWA) 
 instead of Environmental Contaminant (EC).
                                   
                                  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 This patch IB*2*339 modifies the Integrated Billing software to implement 
 the following requirements to prevent billing and report on Project 
 112/SHAD care and replace Environmental Contaminants with Southwest Asia.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
 To fully implement the functionality in this patch requires several 
 patches that are being released in conjunction with Enrollment VistA 
 Changes - Release 2 (EVC R2).  However, technically this patch is not 
 dependent on the other patches in the EVC-R2 project.  The dependent IB 
 functionality will be inactive until the EVC-R2 patches are released and 
 installed.
                                       
 IB*2*339 installation is not dependent on the installation of the other 
 EVC-2 patches.  This patch may be installed before the other EVC-2 
 patches.
                                       
 It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business hours 
 to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.  It should 
 also NOT be installed when the IB NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB (Queue Means Test 
 Compilation of Charges [IB MT NIGHT COMP] option) job is running.

 admission is entered that may be related to Project 112/SHAD, this 
 corresponds to new cases being created for the other classifications.
 2) Updated comments to reflect the change from EC to SWA. 
                                  
 IBAMTI:  Process Special Inpatient Billing Cases

 IBAMTI1:  Disposition Special Inpatient Billing Cases
 1) Option Help text display has been changed to include Project 112/SHAD 
 and Southwest Asia information, also rearranged for screen display wrap.

 indicator if case may be related to Project 112/SHAD and replaced EC with 
 SWA for Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.  Replaced hard coded 
 list of available classifications with a new function call.
                                  
 IBAMTS:  Patient Priority Classification

 on a date to include Project 112/SHAD.  The order of classification 
 priority has been changed to:  SC, CV, AO, IR, EC, SHAD, MST, HNC.
 2) Updated utility that returns patient's highest priority classification 
 on a date to replace EC with SWA.
                                  
 IBAMTS1:  Process Outpatient Encounters for First Party Billing
 1) Comments added regarding processing new or edited encounters due to 
 Project 112/SHAD indicator.  Project 112/SHAD encounters are screened out 
 so no First Party bill will be created, same as all other classifications.
 2) Updated comments to reflect the change from EC to SWA. 
                                  
 IBAMTS2:  Process Outpatient Encounter Changes
 1) Modified the check for changes in classification during editing of an

 IBCCPT:  Bill/Claims Outpatient Encounter Procedures
 1) Corrected error found.  Pre-CIDC the visit classification was displayed 
 for each of the encounters procedures as a potentially non-billable 
 reason.  Post-CIDC each procedure may be identified with a separate 
 classification through the Outpatient Encounters Diagnosis.  The results 
 are that some of an encounters procedures may be associated with a 
 classifiction and therefore non-billable and other procedures for the same 
 encounter may be billable.  When displaying the encounter procedures on 
 the bill the classifications identified with each procedure were being 
 placed incorrectly and therefore were not being displayed.  This has been 
 corrected so the classification associated with each procedure will be 
 displayed.
                                                    
 IBCSC4A:  Bill/Claim Inpatient Professional Procedures
 1) Modified enter/edit of Inpatient Professional Procedures (801) on a 
 bill to include display of Project 112/SHAD (SH) with the other 
 classifications related to procedure: increment counter to recognize the 
 new classification and add new classification to list of classifications.
 2) Replaced classification indicator of EC with SW if procedure is related 
 to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.
                                  
 IBCSC5B:  Bill/Claim Prosthetics Items
 1) Replaced classification indicator of EC with SWA if item is related to 
 Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.
 2) Corrected error found.  The display of classifications related to a 
 procedure was not reset between procedures so the first related 
 classification appeared to be applicable to all following procedures.  
 This has been corrected so only the classification applicable to the 
 individual procedure is displayed for the procedure.
                                  
 IBCSC5C:  Bill/Claim Prescriptions
 1) Modified enter/edit Prescriptions on a bill to include display of 
 Project 112/SHAD (SHAD) with the other classifications related to the 
 prescription: increment counter to recognize the new classification and 
 add the new classification indicator to the list of classifications.
 2) Replaced classification indicator of EC with SWA if prescription is 
 related to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.
                                  
 IBCU74:  Bill/Claim Surgery Anesthesia Procedures
 1) Modified enter/edit of Anesthesia Procedures on a bill to include 
 display of SHAD with the other classifications related to the procedure:

 3) Added other checked indicators that were missing to comments:MST/HNC/CV
                                  
 IBNCPDP1:  Prescription Billable Status Check API
 1) Added Project 112/SHAD to the list of classifications checked to 
 determine if an Rx is billable.
 2) Change Environmental Contaminant classification check to Southwest Asia
 3) Function redesigned.  Previously this function expected all data to be 
 passed in (from ECME) including the prescription classifications.  However 
 since ECME was not going to be updated to pass in the new SHAD 
 classification, this function was redesigned to ignore the classifications 
 passed in and to go directly to Outpatient Pharmacy to get the 
 prescription's classifications.

 Classifications to include Project 112/SHAD: increment counter and output 
 indicator.

 IBTRKR3:  Add Prescriptions to Claims Tracking
 1) Modified adding Prescriptions to Claims Tracking to assign Reason Not 
 Billable of 'PROJECT 112/SHAD' to Prescriptions that are identified as 
 related to Project 112/SHAD in Pharmacy: increment counter to recognize 
 the new classification and add the new classification indicator to the 
 list of classifications.
 2) Replaced Reason Not Billable of 'ENV. CONTAM.' with 'SOUTHWEST ASIA' if 
 Prescription is related to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.
                                  
 IBTRKR41:  Add Outpatient Encounters to Claims Tracking, Send Bulletin
 1) Modified adding Outpatient Encounters to Claims Tracking to assign 
 Reason Not Billable of 'PROJECT 112/SHAD' to Encounters that are 
 identified as related to Project 112/SHAD - if the encounter has no PCE 
 entry(pre-CIDC method): add check for Project 112/SHAD at encounter level.
 2) Modified adding Outpatient Encounters to Claims Tracking to assign 
 Reason Not Billable of 'PROJECT 112/SHAD' to Encounters that are 
 identified as related to Project 112/SHAD - if the encounter does have a 
 PCE entry: add the new classification to the list of classifications.
 3) Replaced Reason Not Billable of 'ENV. CONTAM.' with 'SOUTHWEST ASIA' if 
 Encounter is related to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia - for 
 encounters with no PCE entry (pre-CIDC method): update at encounter level.
 4) Replaced Reason Not Billable of 'ENV. CONTAM.' with 'SOUTHWEST ASIA' if 
 Encounter is related to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia - for 
 encounters with a PCE entry: update classification list.
 5) The Outpatient Encounters to Claims Tracking bulletin text is updated 
 to include the information that the Project 112/SHAD classification was 
 checked on the encounters added to Claims Tracking and to replace 
 Environmental Contaminant with Southwest Asia.
                                  
 IBTRKR5: Add Prosthetics Items to Claims Tracking
 1) Replaced Reason Not Billable of 'ENV. CONTAM.' with 'SOUTHWEST ASIA' if 
 Prosthetic Item is related to Environmental Contaminant/Southwest Asia.
 2) Corrected error found.  After CIDC was installed (260/312) a prosthetic 
 item is identified as related to a classification through the assigned 
 Diagnosis.  However many sites do not yet have CIDC active so this check 
 may not be sufficient.  Therefore this has been changed to include the 
 pre-CIDC check: if the Diagnosis node is not defined and the patient has 
 any claimed classification then the item is added to Claims Tracking with 
 a Reason Not Billable of Needs SC Determination.
 3) Corrected error found.  Once PFSS has been activated, it will no longer 
 be possible to add entries to Claims Tracking for dates after the 
 activation of PFSS.  The check for this has already been included when 
 manually adding Prosthetics Items to Claims Tracking.  However it was 
 erroneously identifying PFSS as active.  This has been corrected so the 
 date limitation of Items to Claims Tracking will only occur after the PFSS 
 activation date.
                                  
 IBTUBO1:  Unbilled Amounts Reports
 1) Comments added regarding processing of events related to Project 
 112/SHAD in the Unbilled Amounts report.  Project 112/SHAD events will be 
 screened out of the report.
 2) Updated comments to reflect the change from EC to SWA.
