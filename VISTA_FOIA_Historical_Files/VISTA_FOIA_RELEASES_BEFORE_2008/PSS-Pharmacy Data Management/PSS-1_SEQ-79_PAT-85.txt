Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 APIS FOR PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will 
 be used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
 writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.  Since the DRUG file (#50) 
 and other drug-related files are being replaced by a vendor product, any 
 direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be replaced by 
 calling the APIs provided in this patch. When the new data source is in 
 place, the calling applications will not be required to make any changes, 
 because these APIs will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested 
 data from the vendor product, when the time comes.
  
 These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
 direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
 replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

 from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
  
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PSS_1_P85_TM_CP.pdf              Technical Manual (change pages)
   PSS_1_TM_R1004.pdf               Technical Manual (updated)
   PHARM_REENG_1_API_MANUAL.PDF     Pharmacy Re-Engineering API Manual

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Pharmacy users can be on the system while this patch is being installed.
 Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*85)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*85.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
  
 8. When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
