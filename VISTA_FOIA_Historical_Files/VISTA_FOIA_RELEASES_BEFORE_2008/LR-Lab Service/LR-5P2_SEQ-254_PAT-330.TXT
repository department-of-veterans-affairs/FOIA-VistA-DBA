 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*330 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*330 does not alter
 or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*330 have no effect on Blood Bank
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes made,
 no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation of this
 patch.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
   
 NOIS FAV-0105-71385 reported the inability to verify Laboratory Electronic
 Data Interchange (LEDI) results when one or all of the lab results being
 processed have 'comment' as the result. Functionality, released in patch
 LR*5.2*286, to prevent editing of reference laboratory results using option
 Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR] prevented user from releasing
 LEDI results.
   
 NOIS ASH-0105-31055 reported the inability to verify LEDI results when one
 or all of the lab results being processed have 'canc' as the result.
 Functionality, released in patch LR*5.2*286, to prevent editing of reference
 laboratory results using option Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR]
 prevented user from releasing LEDI results.
  
 This patch allows users verifying reference laboratory results to release
 results that consist only of 'comment' or 'canc' type results.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 -------------------------
   The install time for this patch is less than 5 minute. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
         option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*330):
         a. Print Transport Global
         b. Backup a Transport Global
         c. Compare Transport Global to Current System
         d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
       Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*330'.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to
       INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// choose 'NO'.  When prompted
       'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
       YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
      The install will automatically disable the following options:
  
        Accession order then immediately enter data [LR ACC THEN DATA]
        Batch data entry (chem, hem, tox, etc.) [LRSTUF]
        Bypass normal data entry [LRFAST]
        Enter/verify data (Load list) [LRVRW2]
        Enter/verify data (Work list) [LRVRW]
        Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR]
        Fast Bypass Data Entry/Verify [LRFASTS]
        Group verify (EA, EL, EW) [LRGV]
        Special test accessioning [LRNONCOM]
        Group data review (verified & EM) [LRGVP]
   
   6.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  Note: Routine LR330 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
