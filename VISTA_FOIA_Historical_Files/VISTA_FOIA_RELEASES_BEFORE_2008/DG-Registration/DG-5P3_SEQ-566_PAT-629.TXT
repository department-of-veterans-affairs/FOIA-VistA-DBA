  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  
 1)HD64326 - LON-1004-61524   Reading card does not pull patient record
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The VIC card does not work with the Routing Slips option; with 
 other options, it is necessary to hit 'Enter' twice, also the 
 patient identifiers are not shown, and the patient security check
 is not done. These problems existed before the introduction of the
 new VIC card.  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The patient lookup routine ^DPTLK has been modified to access
 the patient record without having to hit 'Enter' twice. It will 
 also display the patient identifiers, and display any security 
 warnings for sensitive patients.
  
 2) HD63809 -MIN-0304-41153   Missing Pt. found cannot edit info
  
 Problem:
 ========
 NOIS points out that if data exists in the patient file for MISSING
 PERSON DATE (#.153), the system displays ""APPLICANT IS LISTED AS 
 'MISSING'.  NOTIFY APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL!".  This only happens in 
 the View Registration option, no other option.  Research shows that
 this data in the patient file antedates even the Missing Patient 
 Register (MPR) package which was removed from all sites in 2004
 because it was obsolete, having been replaced by a Web based product.
 The following data fields in the patient file were not part of the
 MPR package and contain questionable data:
  
                 .153     MISSING PERSON DATE
                 .16      MISSING OR INELIGIBLE
                 .1657    MISSING PERSON TWX SOURCE
                 .1658    MISSING PERSON TWX CITY
                 .1659    MISSING PERSON TWX STATE
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DGRP1 has been modified to prevent displaying this message.
  
 This patch also includes a routine DG53P629 which will list all patients
 with data in these fields. The list can be retained for historical 
 purposes, or as a reference for deleting the data using Fileman.
 (see Install Instructions)
  
 3) HD63607 -TAM-0903-31321     PTF Close Out Issue (Fee-Basis)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Sites are unable to close certain Fee Basis PTF records and 
 receive these error messages:
  
 101 MEANS TEST          value AN inconsistent with eligibility data
   or
 101 MEANS TEST          value AS inconsistent with eligibility data
  
 This occurs when the discharge date predates the relevant Means test.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 A one-line change will be made to routine MT^DGPTFVC1 so that this
 consistency checker for Fee Basis records will use the same logic as
 routine MT^DGPTUTL does when calculating the Means Test Indicator value.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, however because
 the patient lookup routines are impacted, we suggest it be installed 
 after business hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
     NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
            will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
            need to repeat this step.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*629):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*629.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', respond Yes.
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
     enter:
         ROUTING SLIPS [SDROUT]
         VIEW REGISTRATION [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]   
         PTF MENU [DG PTF MENU]
  
     When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     hit enter.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
 POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
 Run routine DG53P629. Suggest you queue the report as the routine 
 must read the entire Patient file in order to produce the report.
