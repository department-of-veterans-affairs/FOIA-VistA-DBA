Description: 
============

 This patch exports four consult services.  The services will create or
 replace entries in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file. The services are
 being exported to support an interface with the Prosthetics package.
  
 The 4 services being imported are:
 1)    PROSTHETICS REQUEST
 2)    EYEGLASS REQUEST
 3)    CONTACT LENS REQUEST
 4)    HOME OXYGEN REQUEST
  
 The environment check routine included in this patch identifies
 existing services that partially or exactly match those being imported.
 Upon identification of any partial or exact match, the service name is
 reported to the installer. The environment check routine advises the
 installing person to abort installation if the environment check
 identifies a potential conflict. All messages from the environment check
 are available for later review by using the Install File Print [XPD PRINT
 INSTALL FILE] option and printing install name GMRC*3.0*16.
  
  
 What to do if the environment check identifies a partial match:
 1) Review the service identified as being a partial match.
 2) Determine if the existing service should be disabled based on whether
    the incoming service will replace it.
 3) Remember that ONLY the imported services interface with the Prosthetics
    package.
 4) If the existing service should remain active in addition to the new
    service, the warning may be ignored.
  
 What to do if the environment check identifies an exact match:
 1)  If an exact match was found for one of the four services being installed 
 the existing service will be overwritten with the new service.  If the 
 values in the existing service must be maintained, the name of the existing 
 service MUST be changed.  If you anticipate having the existing services 
 overwritten, review the following fields since you will not be allowed 
 to edit them after the installation of the new services: 
  
        PROVISIONAL DX INPUT
        PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT
        DEFAULT REASON FOR REQUEST
  
 2) Any changes to the name of a service MUST be done via the Set up Consult 
 Services [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] option. Changing the name of a 
 service via VA FileManager can have negative effects on ordering of 
 Consults in CPRS.
  
  
 WARNING: The use of VA FileManager for editing of the REQUEST SERVICES
 (#123.5) file is highly discouraged. Specific safeguards are in place when
 utilizing the Set up Request Services [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] option.
 These safeguards are not present when using Fileman.  
  
  
 The basis of the interface between Consult/Request Tracking and
 Prosthetics is the name of the Consult service being requested. When a
 request for a consult is ordered, if the name of the service requested is
 one of those imported in this patch, the order will be filed in the
 Prosthetics package as well as Consult/Request Tracking.  Since the name
 of the service is critical to the stability of the interface, upon entry
 of this patch, the name of each of the above services will no longer be
 editable. 
  
 Each of the services is being exported with several other fields defined
 based on requirements of the interface. These fields will be overwritten
 and will no longer be editable after installation. The fields that are
 restricted are: 
  
 (#.01)  NAME
 (#1.01) PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT
 (#1.02) PROVISIONAL DX INPUT
 (#124)  DEFAULT REASON FOR REQUEST
  
  
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 1) When your site is prepared to use the Consult services provided in this
    patch, the DISABLED entry in SERVICE USAGE field should be deleted.
    Again, this change should be done using the Set up Consult Services
    [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICES] option. If you chose to install the
    services over existing services that matched exactly, THIS STEP MUST BE
    DONE IMMEDIATELY.
  
   Note: although requests may be entered for the services, the requests
         will not be filed in Prosthetics until installation of RMPR*3*45
  
 2) Any user that should receive notifications can be configured in one of 
    the fields in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file. Details of which 
    fields to configure can be found in the Consult/Request Tracking
    Technical Manual available from the Consults web site at
    http://vista.med.va.gov/consults. 
  
 3) If automatic printing of requests to this service should occur, a
    VistA printer should be entered in field #123.09 SERVICE PRINTER. 
  
 4) During the installation, if the services being installed are new
    entries, they are made sub-services of ALL SERVICES. If you want them
    to be arranged differently within your Consult hierarchy, that will
    have to be done after installation.
  
  
 This patch exports a new option, Copy Prosthetics services [GMRC CLONE
 PROSTHETICS]. This option will allow the creation of additional services
 that will be part of the Prosthetics interface. The name of the services
 is only under partial control of the site. Services created using this
 option will be created as DISABLED services. To make these services
 orderable within CPRS, the DISABLED value must be deleted from the SERVICE
 USAGE field. Certain field values in the copied services will be derived
 from nationally exported services and may not be edited.
