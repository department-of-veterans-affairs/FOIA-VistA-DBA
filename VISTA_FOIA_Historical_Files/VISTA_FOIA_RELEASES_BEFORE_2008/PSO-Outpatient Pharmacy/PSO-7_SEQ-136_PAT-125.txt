 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.
 Do not install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are using the
 software. Installation will take no longer than 2 minutes.
  
 Suggested time to install: During non-peak requirement hours for
 Outpatient Pharmacy users. 
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be

        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
