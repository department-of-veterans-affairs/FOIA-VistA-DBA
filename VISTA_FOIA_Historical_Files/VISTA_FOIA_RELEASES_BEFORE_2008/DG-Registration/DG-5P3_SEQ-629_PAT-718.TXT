Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The install Compliance Date for this patch is September 15, 2006.
  
   *****************************************************************
   This install compliance timeframe is necessary to ensure that the 
   existing Patient Record Flags (PRF) HL7 messaging functionality 
   continues uninterrupted between all Vista Sites regardless of 
   which PRF phase software is being run.
   *****************************************************************
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to enable the existing Patient Record Flags
 module to process PRF HL7 update messages received from sites that have 
 installed the future Patient Record Flags Phase III patch (DG*5.3*650).
  
 The modifications provided by this patch fall into two areas:
  
  1. New error messages - Patient Record Flags Phase III will utilize new 
     error codes that are generated when a PRF HL7 message is rejected by
     a site.  This patch loads new error codes that are used by the error
     processor that creates the PRF MESSAGE TRANSMISSION ERROR MailMan message.
  
  2. PRF HL7 message processing - Patient Record Flags Phase III HL7 update
     messages may contain more than one assignment history record.  This 
     patch allows received messages to be processed regardless of the number
     of assignment histories contained in the message.
