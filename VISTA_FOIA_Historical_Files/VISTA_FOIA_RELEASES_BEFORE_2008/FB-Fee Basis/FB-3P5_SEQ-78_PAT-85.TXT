Subject: CALCULATE PAYMENT DETAIL DESCRIPTION ERROR 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem encountered when using [FBAA PAYMENT 
 MENU] and using menu selection [Calculate Payment Amount]. When you 
 enter the Select Service Provided, the Detail Description is displayed. 
 After which you are asked: "Is this correct? YES//"  If you answer "No" and 
 enter another Service Provided which has a shorter Detail Description, 
 some of the previous Service Provided Detail Description text will 
 display also.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. TOM-1004-41991     Problem with calculate payment in Fee Basis. 
   
    Problem:
    -------
 When in the option Calculate Payment under Fee Basis [FBAA PAYMENT MENU] 
 and you have selected a Service Provided and the Detail Description has 
 been displayed to the screen it ask: "Is this correct?" If you answer No 
 the process starts over asking for a new Service Provided but does not 
 clean out the Detail Description text variable from the previous service
 selected. It then writes over the old text in the variable and if the new
 selection has shorter Detail Description you see part of the previous
 Detail Description when it is displayed to the screen.
  
  
   Solution: 
    ----------
 The process will now reinitialize the Detail Description text variable 
 just prior to calling the CPT API that returns the description. This way
 it is initialized in every pass.
