Subject: GIP, CASE CART AND INSTRUMENT KIT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains six modified routines that deal with certain problems
 with the Generic Inventory Package (GIP), the Stock Status Report, and
 Case Cart distribution orders, all within the IFCAP package.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD0000000055181 - Instrument Kit Posting Problem
 2. HD0000000055205 - GIP-Posting Negative Quantities
 3. HD0000000055212 - Distribution Orders Of Case/Cart Items
 4. HD0000000055232 - Usage vs. Issue On Stock Status Report
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. HD0000000055181 - Instrument Kit Posting Problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some sites reported that when a case cart is assembled in the GIP, the
 instrument kit quantity on hand is reduced in the primary inventory point.
 So when the case cart order is posted, the same instrument kit quantity on
 hand is reduced again in the primary inventory point, creating a double
 deduction from the quantity on hand in the primary inventory point. As a
 result, twice the actual quantity on hand has to be assembled to accommodate
 posting case cart orders with instrument kits so as not to create negative
 on hand balances for the instrument kit items. This problem only occurs with
 items identified as instrument kits. Also, when a distribution order is
 posted, and any of the items requested was an instrument kit, it is somehow
 missing from the distribution order.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch contains a modified version of the case cart/instrument kit post
 routine PRCPOPP3 which should handle the above problems as well as #3 below.
  
  
 2. HD0000000055205 - GIP-Posting Negative Quantities
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported that some users have had problems with distribution orders
 showing items with negative quantities on-hand being posted to secondary
 orders (instead of zero) if there is a negative quantity on-hand for the
 item in the primary orders.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch contains modified versions of the post distribution routines
 PRCPOPL and PRCPOPP that should handle this problem.
  
  
 3. HD0000000055212 - Distribution Orders Of Case/Cart Items
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported that when a distribution order (DO) is posted, if one of the
 items on the DO is a case cart, it is removed from the DO and the user is
 unable to refer to the DO to double-check their work. And the item is not
 removed from the DO if the item is purchasable (not a instrument kit or case
 cart).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch contains a modified version of the case cart/instrument kit post 
 routine PRCPOPP3 which should handle this problem as well as #1 above.
  
  
 4. HD0000000055232 - Usage vs. Issue On Stock Status Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some sites reported that there was a problem with the way data was being
 captured on the Stock Status Report [PRCP STOCK STATUS REPORT] for a
 Secondary in the area of usage and barcode usage transactions. For example,
 in some cases, while the Stock Status Report may not show any Issues, the
 Inventory Sales Report [PRCP INVENTORY SALES REPORT] would show an amount
 for secondary. The users would prefer that Usage be considered an Issue
 status instead of an Adjustment status on the Stock Status Report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch contains modified versions of the Inventory Sales Report
 routines PRCPRISP and PRCPRISS, and Stock Status Report routine PRCPRSSR,
 that will handle the above problem.
  
  
 NOTE: Also included is Patch PRC*5.1*83 routine PRCPLO2, which is a modified
       copy of Patch 41 routine PRCPRSSR with the same new modifications in
       it as in PRCPRSSR.
