 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch OR*3*131 provides some additional updates for POE.  The 
 following fixes are included: 
  
 1. When transferring a med order from inpatient to outpatient, 
 releasing the order immediately, and then placing an inpatient 
 order, the new inpatient order appeared in the outpatient display 
 group.  This has been fixed.  
  
 2. When placing an inpatient quick order from an order set menu, 
 the detailed view showed a Pick Up route.  This has been fixed.  
  
 3. When placing a meds quick order, the quantity can now be modified.
  
 4. When entering a dosage of 0.5 plus other characters, 
 sometimes the user would see the error message "0.5 is not a
 valid floating point value."  This has been fixed.  NOIS 
 PHO-0102-60283 reported this problem.  
  
 5. With complex orders, when clicking on Duration in the order
 dialog form, there was an arrow next to the Days, which caused 
 confusion for some users.  The arrow has been removed.  NOIS 
 PHO-0102-60260 reported this problem.  
  
 6. A nagging instance of missing Display Group data with inpatient 
 meds orders was reported.  An additional fix was implemented to 
 address this item.  NOIS BHH-1101-41397 and ASH-0102-30438 reported
 on this problem.
  
 7. Errors in the tag^routine DCNOTE+3^GMRCADC were reported in 
 NOIS HUN-0102-20373.  This problem has been fixed.  
  
 8. If the "How Long" prompt were left blank in a lab quick order, 
 and the ordering provider then tried to accept the order without 
 entering a value, the text of the error message was potentially 
 confusing, requiring a "number of days" in all cases, regardless 
 of the schedule selected.  This has been corrected to display a 
 more helpful message.
  
 9. If a user/CAC erroneously entered a non-numeric value in the 
 3rd ";" piece of the "ORCH CONTEXT xxxxxxx" parameter for either 
 of these tabs, especially at the system level, CPRS would fall 
 into an infinite loop and eventually crash on opening that tab.  
 This has been corrected so that in that situation, the tab will 
 default to a display of "All signed notes", ignoring the invalid 
 parameter value.
  
 10. If an order was placed by the PS MEDS option, when renewed, 
 the new order belonged to Pharmacy Data Management package instead 
 of the correct Inpatient or Outpatient Medications package. This
 has been corrected.
  
 11. If an order was placed by the PS MEDS option for an inpatient, 
 when copied and delayed for discharge, the inpatient order dialog 
 displayed instead of the outpatient order dialog.  This has been 
 fixed.
  
 12. When renewing orders, the DEA# check will only be applied 
 against Pharmacy orders.
  
 13. When placing IV/IV Quick orders, the DEA# check should now 
 work properly.
  
 14. When placing complex orders, the last column entry of the 
 grid, which allowed entries such as "then" or "and" or "except," 
 could cause confusion to the user if they interpret this field as being 
 connected to the comment field. This conjunction field is only used if 
 there is another dosage added to the complex order.
 If a user was expecting this conjunction to be added as a prefix to the 
 comment field, the possibility existed to create a contradictory order 
 which could become a patient safety issue.
 This patch adds some checking then displays a message box to the user 
 explaining how this conjunction is to be used.
 NOIS HWH-0102-41435 reported this problem.
  
  
 REQUIRED BUILDS:

 NOTE: Internet Explorer 4 (IE4) or later is REQUIRED in order for 
 GUI version 18 to run. IE5 is recommended, inasmuch as note template
 import/export functionality will be unavailable without it.
