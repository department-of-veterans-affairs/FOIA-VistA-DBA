Description:
============

 PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE: PSI-05043 - ICD reported inappropriate lookup of
 diagnosis code when entering "CHF".  
  
 Several applications are performing direct reads of the ICD DIAGNOSIS 
 (#80) file which is used in the search for diagnosis.  This file
 contains the long description for the ICD diagnosis codes as released by
 The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which is the 
 Standards Development Organization (SDO) for ICD codes. In the ICD 
 DIAGNOSIS (#80) file, the long description for Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever
 contains a clause "CHF Congo Virus" and thus when the user enters "CHF",
 the only entry returned is code 065.0 for Crimean Hemorrhagic
 Fever. Most users entering "CHF" are actually seeking Congestive Heart
 Failure, code 428.0.  If these searches were performed using 
 Clinical Lexicon, the user would get a list of various congestive heart
 failure terms from which a selection can be made.  
  
 Since the majority of the NOIS/Remedy tickets citing this problem 
 reflect the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) and Patient Treatment File (PTF)
 packages, an interim solution has been put in place to change the direct
 reads from the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file to Clinical Lexicon within these
 two packages.
  
 In addition, user education has been addressed to reduce these incorrect 
 diagnosis selections.  Additional review of other applications, also 
 performing direct reads of the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file, will follow and
 the long term solution will be addressed by rehosting, using the
 Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) solution.
  
 This patch (DG*5.3*669) will modify the REGISTRATION package so that the
 diagnosis code lookup will utilize Clinical Lexicon.  Therefore, when a
 user enters "CHF" for a diagnosis code within PTF data entry, a list of
 various Congestive Heart Failure terms will be displayed for selection.
 This patch also will modify the DG DRG CALCULATION option to utilize 
 Clinical Lexicon in its lookup.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 None
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 --------------------------------------------------------
 HD00000000106445 -CHF lookup in PTF returns Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever
  
 Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------
  
 Problem:  When a user enters "CHF" for a diagnosis code within PTF data  
 entry it retrieves Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever instead of Congestive Heart
 Failure 
  
 Resolution:  Modified the application PTF data entry to lookup diagnosis
 codes using CLINICAL LEXICON.
