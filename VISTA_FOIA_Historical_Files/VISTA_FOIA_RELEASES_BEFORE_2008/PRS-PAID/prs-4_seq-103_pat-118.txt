Subject: DECEMBER 24,2007 HOLIDAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 On 12/06/2007, President Bush signed an executive order that excuses
 executive branch employees from duty on the Monday before Christmas Day,
 (12/24/2007), except where agency officials decide they must remain open
 because of national security, defense, or other public reasons.
  
 When the President signs an executive order declaring a non-holiday day
 as an official holiday, a patch must be released that will modify the
 software to identify this non-holiday day as a holiday. This patch MUST
 be installed prior to the opening of the pay period which contains the
 newly declared holiday.
  
 This declared holiday falls within pay period 07-26 which runs from
 12/23/2007 through 01/05/2008.
  
 Payroll usually opens pay periods on the Thursday immediately preceding
 the first day of the pay period. For pay period 07-26 this would be
 Thursday 12/20/2007. However, the VistA PAID/ETA software will allow the
 opening of pay periods up to 7 days prior to the first day of the pay
 period.
  
 Patch PRS*4*118 adds December 24, 2007 as a holiday to the Enhanced Time
 and Attendance module of PAID 4.0 (ETA) software. The primary effect of
 adding the holiday to ETA is to correctly update employee timecards when
 pay period 07-26 is opened. Once the patch is installed, December 24,
 2007 will be treated as all other holidays in ETA.
