Description:
============

  
  This patch lays the foundation for future Patient Medication Information
  Sheets (PMI) data updates. It creates the Delete Patient Medication
  Information Sheet Data [PSNDELTE] option. This new stand-alone option
  should only be used as part of future Patient Medication Information Sheet
  update patches. Because it deletes ALL PMI related DATA files, it should
  not be used at any other time.
  
  IMPORTANT: Do NOT use this option until instructed to do so in future PMI
  Update patches. Users MUST HAVE DUZ(0)="@" sign to use this option.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
  Users may be on the system when this patch is installed. Installation takes
  less than one minute.  This patch may be installed during normal
  business hours.
  
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.

     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSN*4.0*75).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

  9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
