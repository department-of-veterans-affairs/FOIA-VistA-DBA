 This patch will address the ALLERGIES/ADVERSE EVENTS report.
  
 The Allergies/Adverse Events report from the Manual Pharmacy 
 Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] menu option has missing and incorrect data
 being reported.
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 I. REMEDY HD167841
  
 Problem:
 Records with historically reported reactions are not being pulled until 
 after an observed record has been processed.  This can result in nearly 
 all historically recorded reactions to not be included in the reations 
 report.
  
 The multiple elements for all symptoms are only getting the first 
 multiple. (ie. The record has only 15 pieces) .  Up to 5 symptoms are not 
 being recorded for the records that are captured.
  
 Data from one record is being retained and included in the next record. 
 This results in reactive data that does not belong to a patient to be 
 recorded within that patient's record.
  
 Solution:
 Correct routines so all records, historically recorded and observed, are
 included in the report.
  
 Correct the logic so up to 6 sets of symptoms get reported. (ie. The 
 record now has 20 pieces, as per the Software Development Document [SDD]).
  
 Clear all data between writing records.
  
 ******************************************************
 TECHNICAL RESOLUTION:
 REMEDY HD167841
 Add a flag, PSUMKFLG, so printing occurs for all appropriate records.
 Add a FOR Loop to gather all Symptoms and make the record have 20 pieces.
 Clear the GRAMCT array between records

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  The Pharmacy Benefits Management User Manual has been updated to reflect
  the updated mailman message sent after the monthly extract is run. 
  
  The revised Pharmacy Benefits Management User Manual is available on the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of
  Information (OI) Field Offices. This file needs to be retrieved in binary
  format.
   
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
   (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
       download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
       first available FTP server.
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
       specific server as follows:
   
                  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
                  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
