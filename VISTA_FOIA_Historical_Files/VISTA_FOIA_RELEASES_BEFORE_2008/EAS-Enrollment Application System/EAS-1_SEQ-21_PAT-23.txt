 OVERVIEW:
 ===========
  
 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) has reinstated the Income Verification
 Matching program, which matches a veteran's self-reported income (that is
 below the Means Test Threshold) with information obtained from the
 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration
 (SSA).   It is anticipated that HEC staff will begin closing cases the
 end of March 2003.   In order to transmit this information to site(s)
 of record for purposes of billing and collection, the Business Office is
 requiring that all sites install no later than March 27, 2003
  
 It should be noted that initially, only means tests conducted for income 
 year 2001 are subject to the income verification matching process.
  
  
 The software for this patch, EAS*1*23 and associated patch, IVM*2*69, are 
 not being distributed through the National Patch Module.  These patches 
 are being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host 
 file).  This patch contains the informational portion of EAS*1*23 and 
 provides field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and 
 implement the patch software.  Please refer to IVM*2*69 for installation 
 instructions.

 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The two patches (EAS*1*23 and IVM*2*69) will allow the data exchange of 
 IVM Verified Means Test Transmission (ORU~Z06) and IVM Billing/Collection 
 Data Transmission (ORU~Z09) HL7 messages between the VAMC sites and the 
 EDB (new Enrollment database).  
  
 Once HEC has received information from IRS and SSA, a review of the 
 information is done.  After that review, if it is determined that the 
 veteran is liable for co-payments, the case will be closed, converted to 
 either Means Test Co-pay Required or GMT Co-pay Required as appropriate.  
 This will trigger an ORU~Z06 to the veteran site(s)of record.  The 
 receipt of the ORU~Z06 adds an entry in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file 
 (#408.31), this test becomes primary for the income year.  Receipt of the 
 ORU~Z06 also alert billing that charges may be applied to any treatment 
 received.  Once charges and/or payments are applied, an ORU~Z09 will be 
 sent to the EDB from the medical center.
  
 If it is later determined that a veteran should not have been converted 
 to a co-payment required status, HEC Staff will initiate a process to 
 send another ORU~Z06 to the veteran site(s) of record and reverts the 
 veteran to his/her previous means test status.
  
  
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
 A new receiver driver process, EASPREC2, a clone of IVMPREC2 will be 
 invoked from the EDB protocol when an ORU-Z06 from the EDB is received.  
 The new Z06 receiver, EASPREC7 - clone of IVMPREC7, will then be executed 
 that will create or delete the Z06 IVM Means Test.  Creation or deletion 
 is based upon value received in the ORU-Z06 in segment ZIV sequence 8 
 (IVM CASE STATUS).
  
   IVM Case Status:
     Value of 1 = Create/Update Z06 MT, Close Case and Mark REASON CODE as
                  'Converted'
     Value of 0 = Cancel Z06 MT and Mark REASON CODE as 'Not Convert'
  
     If Z06 MT and IVM Case Status is 1 and Z06 MT does not exist Then 
       Create new Z06 MT (new Z06 MT becomes primary and existing MT 
       becomes non-primary)
       Assign REASON CODE of 'Converted' in #301.5
     If Z06 MT already exists Then 
       If IVM Case Status is 0 Then 
         Delete Z06 MT for income year and return old MT to primary
         Change REASON CODE from 'Converted' to 'Not Converted' in #301.5
       If IVM Case Status is 1 Then
         Update MT Z06 and Close/Convert Case
     Else  (Z06 MT, IVM Case Status=0 and Z06 MT does not exist)
       Send back 'AE' to EDB indicating MT Z06 not available for 
       cancellation
  
 Based upon the receipt and subsequent uploading of the Z06, billing is 
 notified to begin back billing for that income year.  EASPTRN5 - clone of 
 IVMPTRN5, will produce a ORU-Z09, IVM billing transmission, that will be 
 sent to the EDB.
  
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL
 ====================================
 The software for this patch is being distributed in host file 
 IVM_2_P69.KID.  The host file will contain the two KIDS builds.  The 
 first build will be the Income Verification Match patch, IVM*2*69, the 
 second build will be the Enrollment Application System patch, EAS*1*23.
  
 Please refer to the 'Software and Documentation Retrieval' section of the 
 IVM*2*69 patch description for instructions on how to acquire the patch 
 software and documentation.
