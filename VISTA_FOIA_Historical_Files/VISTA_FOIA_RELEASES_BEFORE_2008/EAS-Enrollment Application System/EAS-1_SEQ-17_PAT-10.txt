  ============
  This patch addresses issues identified in the following NOISes:

      MAC-0401-60298     Live with spouse on MT?  bdj
  
  PATCH DESCRIPTION:
  ==================
  With patch XT*7.3*23, released October 15, 1998, a Patient Merge tool 
  (in the XDR namespace) was released to allow VAMCs the ability to merge 
  Patient Records in the PATIENT (#2) File. It allows for a special merge
  routine based on file number, but one was never developed to prevent 
  duplicate PATIENT RELATION (#408.12) File entries when PATIENT (#2) File
  records are merged. 
  
  This patch will provide the following for the special merge routine:
    - a manual clean-up tool for fixing currently affected records
    - an option that provides several reports to identify potential 
      duplicates in the database.
    - an option to allow the deletion of MT/Copay Dependents.
  
  OPTION SUMMARY:
  ===============
  This patch adds the following menu options to the Means Test Supervisor
  Menu [DG MEANS TEST SUPERVISOR MENU] :
  
  EAS DELETE MT/COPAY DEPENDENT - Delete Means Test/Copay Dependents. This
  menu option requires the user to be a holder of the DG MEANSTEST security
  key. The option will allow authorized users to delete a Means Test and/or
  Copay test dependent without having to manually process all Means Tests
  on file for the patient.  Data deleted during the process is stored in an
  ^XTMP global for 10 days.
  
  EAS DUPLICATE DEPENDENTS RPT - Duplicate Dependents Report. This report
  will allow Means Test supervisors who hold the DG MEANSTEST security key
  to determine which dependents could be duplicates in the PATIENT RELATION
  (#408.12) File.  In most cases, these duplicates can be corrected by
  using either the EAS DELETE MT/COPAY DEPENDENT or EAS MERGE DUP MT/COPAY
  DEP menu options.  This option will categorize and generate reports for 
  the potential duplicates in the following manner:
  
  1 - Patient is NOT deceased -
  
      a.  Means Test Cat C - CMOR is a site other than the facility 
          generating the report.
      b.  Means Test Cat C - CMOR is the site generating this report. 
      c.  Other Category Means Test - CMOR is a site other than the 
          facility generating the report.
      d.  Other Category Means Test - CMOR is the site generating this 
          report.
  
  2 - Patient is deceased - 
      
      a. Means Test Cat C - CMOR is a site other than the facility 
         generating the report.
      b. Means Test Cat C - CMOR is the site generating this report.
      c. Other Category Means Test - CMOR is a site other than the 
         facility generating the report.
      d. Other Category Means Test - CMOR is the site generating this 
         report.
  
  EAS MERGE DUP MT/COPAY DEP - Merge Duplicate MT/Copay Dependents. This
  menu option will allow holders of the DG MEANSTEST security key the
  ability to merge dependents considered to be duplicates in the PATIENT
  RELATION (#408.12) File.  Data deleted during the process is stored in an
  ^XTMP global for 10 days.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system/should be loaded during
  non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users.   Installation will take
  less than 1 minute. 
  
                 ********** W A R N I N G **********
  
  After installation of patch EAS*1*10, KIDS will attempt to rebuild all
  user menus.  This process can be very lengthy (several hours). For this
  reason, it is highly recommended that the installation be queued to run
  during a time of low system activity to accomodate the menu rebuild.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.] 
  
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*10):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
