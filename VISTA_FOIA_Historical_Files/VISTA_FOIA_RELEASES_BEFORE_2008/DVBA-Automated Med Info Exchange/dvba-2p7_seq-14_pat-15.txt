Subject: 1 DAY NOTICE OF DISCHARGE PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  AMIE allows a VA Regional Office to request a Notice of Discharge when a
  veteran is admitted to a VA Medical Center.  The original design of AMIE
  generated a Notice of Discharge seven days after the discharge for a
  respective veteran occurred.  The Veterans Benefits Administration has
  requested that AMIE generate a Notice of Discharge one day after the
  discharge for a respective veteran occurs.
  
  Patch DVBA*2.7*15 will change AMIE so that a Notice of Discharge is
  generated the day following a respective veterans' discharge.
  
  NOTE:  So Notices of Discharge may be available to VA Regional Offices
  the day following the actual discharge, it is suggested the Notification
  of Discharge via TaskMan [DVBA 7132 TASKMAN] option be scheduled to run
  each day PRIOR to normal business hours.  See the Implementation and
  Maintenance section in the AMIE V2.7 Technical Manual for other
  information regarding this option.
  
  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:  Be sure to complete the "Instructions to catch up
  Notices of Discharge" section below to assure all Notices of Discharge
  are generated at your site.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system but IRM should check
  TaskMan to be sure the AMIE option,  Notification of Discharge via TaskMan
  [DVBA 7132 TASKMAN], is not scheduled to run during this installation.
  Additionally, IRM should check with the individual responsible for managing
  the AMIE system to ensure that the option, Manual Discharge Notification
  Processing [DVBA MANUAL NOTIFY], is not running.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*15):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*15.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
        Manual Discharge Notification Processing   [DVBA MANUAL NOTIFY]
   
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  8.  Upon completion of this installation, a one-time catch-up process
      must be run to assure that all Notices of Discharge are generated for
      discharges that occurred during the previous week.  To complete this,
      the individual responsible for the management of AMIE at your site
      should follow the instructions below.
  
  
  Instructions to catch up Notices of Discharge:

  2. At the 'Enter BEGINNING date:' prompt, enter T-7
