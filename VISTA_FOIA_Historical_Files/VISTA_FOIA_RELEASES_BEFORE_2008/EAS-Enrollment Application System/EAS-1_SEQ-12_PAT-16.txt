 INTRODUCTION
 ============
  
 The software for this patch, EAS*1*16, and associated patch, DG*5.3*460, 
 are not being distributed through the National Patch Module.  These 
 patches are being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution 
 (host file).  This patch contains the informational portion of EAS*1*16 
 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to acquire and 
 install the patch software.
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS calls:
  
         LEX-0602-42637
         SDC-0602-62645
  
  
 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 ====================
 1. In the option to Add a New LTC Copayment Test, if a veteran has a 
 means test on file but declined to provide financial information, the 
 calculation to determine if the veteran is below the threshold for LTC 
 copayments is using 0 for the veteran's income and incorrectly creating a 
 LTC Copayment Test with a status of EXEMPT and an exemption reason of 
 INCOME (LAST YEAR) BELOW LTC THRESHOLD.  To resolve this issue, 
 modifications were made to the routines EASECMT and DGMTSCU2 (included in 
 patch DG*5.3*460).  The threshold calculation was modified to check if 
 the veteran declined to provide financial information for the means test 
 (Field #.14 in File #408.31).  If so, the veteran is not exempt from LTC 
 Copayments and must complete the 10-10EC.  Another check was added that 
 if the veteran's last means test was after 10/5/1999 and had a status of 
 MT Copay Required (Cat C) or Pending Adjudication and the veteran agreed 
 to pay the copayment then another means test was not required.
  
 2. A LTC Copay Exemption Test is completed for a veteran who is not 
 required to take a Means Test.  Upon completion of the LTC Copay 
 Exemption Test the system automatically checks to see if an RX Copay Test 
 should be created.  If the veteran is a DOM patient an RX Copay Test 
 should not be created.  This condition was missing from the check.  
 Modifications were made to the routine EASECMT to add the check to 
 determine if the veteran is a DOM patient and if true not to create an RX 
 Copay Test.
  
 3. In the option to Print Application for Extended Care (10-10EC), the 
 incorrect insurance names and addresses were printing in section II.  The 
 incorrect value was being used to retrieve the insurance data from the 
 Insurance Company file #36.  A modification was made in tag DATA2 of 
 routine EASEC100 to get the correct pointer value from the Insurance 
 sub-file #2.312 of the Patient file #2.

 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
 ===================  
 The software for this patch is being distributed in a host file.  The 
 host file will contain two KIDS builds.    
   
     Host file name: EAS_1_P16.KID
   
             Builds:  EAS*1*16
                      DG*5.3*460
                      
 Sites may retrieve the software directly using FTP from  the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
             Albany:  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
              Hines:  ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City:  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
    * Note: Use ASCII mode when transferring the .KID file.
            
   
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================  
   * This software distribution requires the following patches be 
     installed:
   
      EAS*1*7
      DG*5.3*433
   
   * These patches can be loaded with users on the system.  
     Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
  
   Installation Steps:
   ===================
   
   1. Download the KIDS file EAS_1_P16.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
      directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the
      appropriate directory on your system.
   
   2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION 
      menu, and enter:  EAS_1_P16.KID
   
   3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1*16 or DG*5.3*460
      are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this 
      time.
   
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select 
      the Installation menu.
   
   5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*16).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
         
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*16.
   
   7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
   8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
      DG MEANS TEST ADD               Add a New Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST COMPLETE          Complete a Required Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST EDIT              Edit an Existing Means Test
      EASEC LTC COPAY TEST ADD        Add a New LTC Copayment Test
      EASEC LTC COPAY TEST EDIT       Edit an Existing LTC Copayment Test
      EASEC LTC COPAY TEST PRINT      Print Application for Extended Care
                                       (10-10EC)
   
   9. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
   
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 After patches EAS*1*16 and DG*5.3*460 have been installed it will be 
 possible to correct any LTC Copayment Tests that were completed with a 
 false exemption status.  Follow these steps:
  
 1. Use the 'Delete a LTC Copay Exemption Test' option to delete the LTC 
 Copay Exemption Test.  NOTE: This is the test that determines if a 
 veteran needs to complete a LTC Copay Test (10-10EC), not the LTC Copay 
 Test itself.
  
 2. Then use the 'Edit an Existing LTC Copayment Test' and select the LTC 
 Copay Test that needs to be corrected.  The system will redo the 
 exemption check and a veteran with a means test who declined to provide 
 income information will be considered non-exempt from completing the LTC 
 Copay Test.  You should then be able to proceed with the LTC Copay Test 
 (10-10EC).

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - EASECMT

 EN+16 - A new line was added to check if the veteran's last means test 
 was after 10/5/1999, had a status of MT Copay Required (Cat C) or Pending 
 Adjudication, and the veteran agreed to pay the copayment.  If true, then 
 set the DGEXMPT flag to 0 (not exempt) and create LTC4 test from this 
 means test.
  
 EN+24 - Add a check if veteran is DOM patient. If not DOM then call the 
 routine to create an RX copay test (type 2) if needed.
  
 EN+34 - Add a check if veteran is DOM patient. If not DOM then call the 
 routine to create an RX copay test (type 2) if needed.
  
 THRES+16 - Add a line to check if the veteran declined to give financial 
 information (Field #.14 in File #408.31).  If true, return 0 (above the 
 threshold).

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - EASEC100

 In tag DATA2, change all references to the variable that is looping 
 through the insurance multiple (.312) of the Patient file #2 from EASINS 
 to EASI.
  
 DATA2+9 - Add the .01 field to the list of fields being retrieved from 
 the Insurance sub-file (#2.312).
  
 DATA2+15 - Add this line to set variable EASINS equal to the value of the 
 .01 field in the Insurance sub-file (#2.312) of the Patient file #2.  
 This is the pointer to the Insurance Company file #36 and will be passed 
 to INSDAT to retrieve the insurance company name, address and phone 
 number.
