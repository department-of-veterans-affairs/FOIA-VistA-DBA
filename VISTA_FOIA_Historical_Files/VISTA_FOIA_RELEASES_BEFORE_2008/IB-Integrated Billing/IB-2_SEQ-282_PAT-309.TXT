Subject: PHARMACY ENCAPSULATION DRUG FILE 50 AND ASSOCIATED FILE CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to replace direct global
 references to Pharmacy data with calls to Application 
 Program Interfaces (APIs) for the Integrated Billing (IB)
 package.
  
 Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) Encapsulation Cycle 1
 patches, PSS*1*85 and PSN*4*80, were released nationally
 on 10/18/04. These patches provided APIs to be used in
 place of direct global references to the DRUG file (#50)
 owned by Pharmacy Data Management and the National
 Drug File packages.
  
 Financial Management Systems applications are affected because there are
 currently direct references to the PSDRUG global. This patch replaces
 these direct global calls within the IB package, with calls to the
 appropriate APIs.
