Subject: HIPAA/NCPDP - DECREASE ADJUSTMENT UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
 
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.
 
 This patch modifies the software supporting the Decrease Adjustment [PRCAC 
 TR DECREASE] option.  The software was enhanced to allow the user to enter the
 ECME # when processing the decrease adjustment. The existing software prompts 
 the user for the BILL # and performs a file look-up to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 file (#430).  The enhancements enable the user to select either a bill number 
 or an ECME #.  If an ECME # is used, then the file look-up is performed on 
 the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) as the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430) and the
 BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) are linked.  If BILL # or if ECME # is selected, the 
 record entry to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430) is returned and the 
 pre-existing program logic is executed.
