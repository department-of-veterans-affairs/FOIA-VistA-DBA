 This patch corrects a problem in the routine XUSNPIE2 which prevents output 
 of reports generated from the "Print Local NPI Reports" [XUS NPI LOCAL 
 REPORTS] option to be successfully sent to a SPOOL device.
  
 This patch also changes the field NPI (#41.99) in the NEW PERSON file (#200) 
 from REQUIRED to NOT REQUIRED.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem with updating individuals indicated as 
 needing an NPI value, but subsequently changed so that they do not need an 
 NPI value.
  
 This patch modifies the "Add/Edit NPI values for Providers" [XUS NPI ENTER 
 NPI FOR PROVIDER] functionality to update the need for an NPI value before 
 indicating falsely that "Need for an NPI isn't indicated."
  
 A problem with incorrectly identifying users as Needing an NPI value based 
 on PERSON CLASS sub-file (#200.05) values in which either the Effective Date 
 (#2) or the Expiration Date (#3) is entered early is also corrected.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem where individuals who had previously had 
 entries under DIVISION which were subsequently removed, might not be listed 
 when Sort by Division was selected for the print options.
  
 In those cases where Sort by Division is selected for print options and one
 or more providers, due to multiple divisions, are listed under more than one
 division (which increases the apparent count of individuals listed), the 
 patch also adds a line indicating the number of providers with multiple 
 divisions and the total number of extra times they were listed. 
 The totals listed at the end of the report count each unique billable
 provider; therefore, if a billable provider is displayed on the report
 more than one time they will only be counted once.
