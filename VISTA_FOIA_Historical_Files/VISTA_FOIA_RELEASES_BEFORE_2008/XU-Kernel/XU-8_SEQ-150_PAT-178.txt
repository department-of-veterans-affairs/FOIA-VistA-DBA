Subject: KIDS - Backup Message Subject Too Long

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Bug Fixes 
 =========
 When using option "Backup a Transport Global" [XPD BACKUP], MailMan allows
 a maximum of 63 characters for it's 'Subject'.  It is possible that with
 the combination of the Name of the Package and other parts of the
 suggested 'Subject' that the length will become longer than the 63
 character limit.  The 'help' also did not suggest what the possible
 problem was and if the user up-arrowed "^", no back-up message would be
 created.  This patch corrects the 'help' so the user will now know the
 'Subject' is a 3 to 63 character response.  This patch will also truncate
 to the Left Most 63 characters, the user may then edit the 'Subject' to
 their individual needs.
