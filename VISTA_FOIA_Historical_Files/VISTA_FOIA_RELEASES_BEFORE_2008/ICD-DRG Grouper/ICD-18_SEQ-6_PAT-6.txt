   This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
   Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
   routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
   the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
   implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
   and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
   This patch is one of three installs contained in a combined KIDS 
   distribution:
  
       CSV UTIL 1.0
  
           LEX*2.0*25
           ICD*18.0*6
           ICPT*6.0*14
  
   The combined distribution consist of both a KIDS host file and a data
   global host file:
  
       KIDS Distribution        CSV_UTIL_1_0.KID
       Data Global              CSV_UTIL_1_0.GBL
 
   Installing the CSV UTIL 1.0 build provides all of the updates
   listed below.  Sites will use the Multi-Build Distribution to
   ensure the proper order of installation for the LEX, CPT, and
   ICD utilities.
  
   This update includes additions and modifications to entries in the ICD
   DIAGNOSIS file (#80), and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).

           * The field AGE LOW (#14) is created
