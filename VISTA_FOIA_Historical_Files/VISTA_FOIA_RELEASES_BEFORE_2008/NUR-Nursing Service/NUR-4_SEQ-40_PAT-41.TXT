Subject: ERRONEOUS DELETION OF SERVICE POSITION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Option [NURAFL-SPO] Service Position File, Edit will delete an existing 
 entry if any required fields are missing. The routine is not checking to
 see if it is a new entry or an edit.  This occurs even if Exit is selected
 from the form. If the deleted record in NURS SERVICE POSITION file 
 (#211.3) is pointed to by NURS POSITION CONTROL file (#211.8), an error
 will occur. The error can occur when using Option [NURAED-STF-LOC]
 Location Edit, Employee if the chosen record points to a deleted record in
 NURS SERVICE POSITION file (#211.3). Other options exercise the same code
 as well.

     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.

      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...

           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter NUR*4.0*41):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package NUR*4.0*41.

     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options 
 you would like to place out of order, enter the following:

 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
     you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
