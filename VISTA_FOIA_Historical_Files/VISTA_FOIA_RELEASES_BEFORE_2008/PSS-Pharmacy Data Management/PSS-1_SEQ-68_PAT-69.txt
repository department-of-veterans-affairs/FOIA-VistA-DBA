Description:
============

 1. PSS*1*69 provides additional internal preparation at your site for 
    the eventual release of the Herbal/OTC/Non-VA Meds Documentation 
    project.  
  
    An important part of this patch is the update of the DRUG file (#50).  
    The Post-install routine for patch PSS*1*68 automatically marked for 
    Non-VA Med use every active dispense drug that was marked for 
    outpatient use. Some of these dispense drugs marked for Non-VA Med use 
    were actually being used as supply items. A dispense drug is being 
    used as a supply if the entry in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file 
    (#50.7) it is associated with has the SUPPLY field (#.09) set to 1 
    (one). Many sites have expressed their concern about having supply 
    items automatically marked for Non-VA Med use. Therefore, sites can 
    automatically unmark such items through this patch. The unmarking of 
    supply items as Non-VA Meds will be optional. During the patch 
    installation the installer will be prompted "Unmark supply items as 
    Non-VA Meds? Y //". If 'YES' is selected, every supply item in the 
    DRUG file (#50) marked for Non-VA Med use will be unmarked. If for any 
    reason the installer chooses NOT to un-mark supply items for Non-VA 
    Med use and later wishes to do so, run the Mumps routine PSSUNMSI 
    distributed with this patch.  
  
 2. A new multiple field NON-VA MEDS (#52.2), has been added to the 
    PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). This field will be used in the future 
    to store Non-VA Med orders.  
  
 3. The NON-VA MED field (#8) in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
    is being modified to be "Uneditable".

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Users can be on the system at the time of installation. However, it is 
  recommended that you run this installation at night, when users are 
  probably not using the PDM (Pharmacy Data Management) application.  
  
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*69) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*69.  
   
   6. When prompted "Unmark Supply Items as Non-VA Meds? YES//", respond 
      whether the patch should automatically unmark all supply items as 
      Non-VA Meds or not. More detailed information can be found above 
      about this post-install process (item #1).  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   9. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
