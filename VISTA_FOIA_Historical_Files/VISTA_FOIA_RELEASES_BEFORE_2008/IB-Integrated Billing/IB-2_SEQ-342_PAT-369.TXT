Subject: IB SUPPORT FOR ASCD

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch exports API's to support the Automated Service Connected 
 Designation (ASCD) project (SD*5.3*495).  The ASCD project allows review 
 of an encounters Service Connected designation after the encounter is 
 checked out.  The IB API's in this patch provide Billing data for ASCD 
 reports and the ability to update an encounters Reason Not Billable.
                                     
 Update Encounters Reason Not Billable:
 With ASCD the Service Connected designation for an encounter is reviewed 
 and potentially changed after check-out.  If that encounter has already 
 been added to Claims Tracking, then it is possible that the original Reason 
 Not Billable added for the encounter is no longer appropriate.  Therefore, 
 an encounters Reason Not Billable may be updated by the ASCD review.
                                     
 When an encounters Service Connected designation is changed in ASCD,
 Claims Tracking may also be updated:
                                     
 o If an encounter is changed to Service Connected during the ASCD review 
   and an entry exists in Claims Tracking for the encounter with no Reason 
   Not Billable, then the encounters Claims Tracking entry is updated:
   -  The Reason Not Billable of 'SC TREATMENT' is added
   -  The Billable Finding of 'NSC TO SC' and Last Reviewed By is added
   Note that if the encounter is already billed, then the bill and the new 
   Billable Finding will be added to the CT Entered/Not Reviewed Report 
   [IBT ENTERED NOT REVIEWED]
                                     
 o If an encounter is changed to Non-Service Connected during the ASCD 
   review and an entry exists in Claims Tracking for the encounter with a 
   Reason Not Billable of 'SC TREATMENT', then the encounters Claims 
   Tracking entry is updated:
   -  The Reason Not Billable of 'SC TREATMENT' is deleted
   -  The Billable Finding of 'SC TO NSC' and Last Reviewed By is added
   Note that the encounter will be added to the Un-reviewed Claims for 
   Coders Report [IBT UNREVIEWED CODING REPORT] and if the encounter is 
   already billed, then the bill and the new Billable Finding will be 
   added to the CT Entered/Not Reviewed Report [IBT ENTERED NOT REVIEWED]
