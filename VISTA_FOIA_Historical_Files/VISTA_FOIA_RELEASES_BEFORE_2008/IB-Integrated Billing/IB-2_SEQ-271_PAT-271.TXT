Subject: UPDATES TO INSURANCE IDENTIFICATION & VERIFICATION (IIV)

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates several items related to Insurance Identification and
 Verification functionality.  Several users' requests and suggestions
 have been included as enhancements to the software.   Other enhancements
 were made to alleviate potential areas of confusion for the users.  This
 patch also corrects some problems with the IIV software that were
 reported through NOIS.  In general, the majority of the changes that the
 users will see with this patch are improved user interfaces and
 simplified configuration of the software.
 
 
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):

 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
 
 
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 BAY-0204-31962         IIV inquiries are increasing
 FGH-0304-32103         Important IIV Msg-Monetary Amount
 UNY-0204-11346         ERROR - CHK+23^IBCNEHLQ
 WPB-0904-32212         ERROR - EN+43^IBCNEDE2:1, %DSM-E-NULL SUBSCR"
 
 
 IRM, Please Note:
 ----------------
 As a result of the installation of this patch, some critical
 functionality has changed.  Therefore, the Insurance Supervisor must be
 notified that the Most Popular Insurance functionality, accessed by the
 MOST POPULAR PAYER (MP) action of the IIV Site Parameters screen, has
 been modified.  Prior to this patch, the Most Popular Insurance Companies
 were automatically identified based on the number of authorized bills
 created.  This patch has changed two aspects of this functionality.  The
 list will be populated with payers rather than insurance companies.  In
 addition, these payers will be manually entered by each site.  As a
 result of these changes, the prior values of this list have been deleted.
 If your site has elected to use this functionality, the table should be
 updated with the payers that are most commonly used in your facility and
 who are nationally active for IIV.
 
 To accomplish this, the Insurance Supervisor should select the option
 MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS], then select
 "IV" for Insurance ID and Verification.  Finally, select "MP" for Most
 Popular Payers within the IIV parameters to populate the list.
 
 
 Overview of Patch Items:
 ------------------------
 
 1)Problem: PENDING INQUIRIES ARE INCREASING (NOIS: BAY-0204-31962)
   --------
 The problem of a potentially inflated number of pending inquiries listed
 on the IIV Statistical Report and in the stored data itself has been
 corrected.  Before this patch, if inquiries were retried and a single
 response was received, the inquiries that did not receive a response
 remained pending forever.  We have revised the software in two ways.
 When a retry is generated and the previously sent inquiry did not receive
 a response, the status of the previous inquiry is set to communication
 failure.  If a subsequent response is received for this inquiry, the
 status will be appropriately updated as the response is received.  In 
 addition, when a response is received for one of the inquiries (retry 
 or original) the status of the remaining inquiries will be changed to 
 communication failure (assuming that the current status of the inquiry 
 (#365.1) is not response received).
 
 2)Problem:  REMOVE DASHES FROM THE SSN FIELDS IN THE PID AND GT1
   --------  SEGMENTS
 
 Dashes within a social security number are no longer included in the HL7
 PID and GT1 segments, when they are transmitted to Austin for IIV.
 
 3)Problem:  MODIFY MONETARY AMOUNT FIELD (#365.02,.08)
   --------  (NOIS: FGH-0304-32103)
 
 The Monetary Amount field input transform was modified to accept values
 as large as $999,999,999.00 (formerly the limit was $99,999,999.00).
 
 4)Problem: TEST PATIENTS WERE PICKED UP BY THE IIV EXTRACTS
   --------
 The IIV extracts were picking up test patients found in the production 
 account, if they met the extracts' selection criteria.  This has been
 corrected to ensure that the IIV extracts will skip test patients.
 
 5)Enhancement:  IIV PURGE FUNCTIONALITY UPDATE
   ------------
 The purge utility was updated to display a message to the user
 indicating that journaling should be disabled for ^IBCN when using the
 purge option. A message will now be sent to the IBCNE MESSAGE GROUP on
 the first of each month (assuming the nightly batch process is running)
 if, and only if, there are eligible IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE or IIV
 RESPONSE records to be purged.
 
 6)Enhancement:  IIV RESPONSE REPORT AND IIV PAYER REPORT UPDATES
   ------------
 The prompts for selecting the payers and the patients for the report
 have been changed from one (payer/patient) or all (payers/patients)
 rather than entering a range of names (payer/patient).
 
 The Eligibility/Benefit information displayed on the IIV Response Report
 was logically grouped for readability and quick identification of key
 information.  The error information that displays on the IIV Response
 Report has been modified to display the entire description (it
 previously truncated the text).
 
 7)Enhancement:  MOST POPULAR LIST UPDATES
   ------------
 The Most Popular Insurance Company list that can be found within the IIV
 Site Parameters screen has been replaced.  The new list is now
 configurable by the users, and is a list of payers rather than insurance
 companies.  This new list is referred to as the Most Popular Payer list.
 
 A new ListMan interface was created to maintain the Most Popular Payer
 List.  The IIV Site Parameter fields included in the IB Site Parameters 
 file (#350.9) were revised to reflect the change in functionality and 
 conversion from insurance company to payer.
 
 8)Enhancement:  ADD SSN AND DATE OF BIRTH UPDATE TO MAILMAN MESSAGES
   ------------
 The last four digits of the patient's social security number, as well
 as, the patient's date of birth have been included in MailMan messages
 generated by IIV when referring to a patient.  This was done to simplify
 the patient identification process.
 
 9)Enhancement:  CHANGE ERROR INFORMATION FORMAT IN INSURANCE BUFFER
   ------------  EXPAND ENTRY SCREEN
 
 The display of Error Information when using the Expand Entry action of
 the insurance buffer caused some confusion for the users.  The format of
 'Code: Description' was unclear when the code was numeric.  For example,
 if the code was '78', the users interpreted it as having 78 errors rather
 than identifying '78' as the code associated with the error.  To
 alleviate potential confusion, the displaying of error information was
 modified to be more user friendly, specifically 'Description (Error
 Condition 'Code')' and 'Description (Error Action 'Code')' are now
 displayed.
 
 10)Enhancement:  REVISE RESPONSE PROCESSING AND IIV STATUS CODES
    ------------
 In order to provide more complete and accurate information to the users,
 the processing of IIV responses has been modified to take advantage of
 additional information provided to VistA through the interface.  This
 additional information will provide a more accurate reflection of the
 patient's insurance eligibility as reported by the Payer.
 
 A new IIV status has been introduced, '#'.  This new status represents
 two different scenarios.  It identifies payer responses received by
 VistA that are ambiguous, and therefore could not be categorized as a
 true indication that the patient does or does not have active insurance.
 It also identifies any payer response that encountered a problem in
 either Austin or by the Payer.  In addition, the definition of two of the
 existing IIV status codes has been revised to be more intuitive.  These
 are:
 
     '+' - patient has active insurance
     '-' - patient does not have active insurance
 
 11)Enhancement:  MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF INSURANCE INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN
    ------------  ASSOCIATED PAYER
 
 Prior to this patch, when a patient had no active insurance, no inactive
 insurance, and the most popular insurance company functionality had been
 turned off, an inquiry without an associated payer ("blank inquiry")
 would be generated.  The only situation that would prevent this from
 happening was if another "blank inquiry" had been generated within
 the freshness period.  To reduce the number of "blank inquiries",
 IIV will now check if an inquiry was transmitted for any payer (or no
 payer) within the freshness period.  If anything is found, the "blank
 inquiry" will not be generated.
 
 12)Enhancement:  REMOVE CONFUSING IIV SITE PARAMETERS
    ------------
 The following General Parameters will now be automatically set to the
 following values:
 
     Field Name                                   System wide Value
     ----------                                   -----------------
     TIMEOUT DAYS (#350.9,51.05)                         3
     NUMBER RETRIES (#350.9,51.06)                       1
     TIMEOUT MAILMAN MSG (#350.9,51.07)                  NO
     INQUIRE SECONDARY INSURANCES (#350.9,51.23)         YES
 
 The Suppress Buffer field (#350.9002,.06) has been set to a system wide
 value of YES for the Appointment and Non-Verified IIV Batch Extracts.
 
 13)Enhancement:  MODIFIED THE EXTRACT LOGIC THAT USES THE MOST POPULAR
    ------------  LIST.
 
 The software was modified to have the Inactive flag and the Most Popular
 flag work together.  Now when the Inquire Popular Payers field
 (#350.9,51.09) is enabled and the Inquire Inactive Insurance field
 (#350.9,51.08) is disabled, IIV will no longer generate an inquiry for a
 payer that is listed on the most popular payer list, if that patient has
 an inactive policy with that payer.
 
 14)Enhancement:  MODIFIED RESPONSE PROCESSING
    ------------
 The response processing logic was modified so that responses reported as
 inactive insurance policies for Identification inquiries will no longer
 be entered into the insurance buffer.  Identification inquiries are
 those inquiries that are generated by IIV as a result of checking a
 patient's inactive policies and/or checking the payers listed in the
 Most Popular Payer List.  These reported inactive policies can be viewed
 through a new IIV report, IIV Inactive Policy report, instead of the
 insurance buffer.
 
 15)Enhancement: IIV INACTIVE POLICY REPORT
    ------------
 The new IIV Inactive Policy report reflects responses that indicate
 inactive coverage was discovered by IIV, where the patient did not have
 active insurance on file.
 
 16)Enhancement: IIV AMBIGUOUS POLICY REPORT
    ------------
 The new IIV Ambiguous Policy report reflects ambiguous responses when
 coverage was discovered by IIV, where the patient did not have active
 insurance on file.
 
 17)Enhancement: IIV NIGHTLY PROCESS CAN BE RUN MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
    ------------ 
 The IIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] option, which was
 introduced with patch IB*2.0*184, can be scheduled to run multiple
 times a day within TaskMan.  
 
 * Note:  This will cause multiple identical copies of the IIV 
 Statistical Report and the IIV Purge MailMan message to be sent to
 those members of the mail group associated with IIV (this is defined in
 the General Parameter section of the IIV Site Parameters screen).
 
 18)Enhancement: IIV STATISTICAL REPORT MODIFICATION
    -----------
 Replaced the misleading message that is displayed in the Current Status
 section of the IIV Statistical Report (Run menu option "Link Insurance
 Companies to Payers" for assistance) with more meaningful instructions,
 "Please link the associated active insurance companies to these payers
 at your earliest convenience.  Locally activate the payers after you
 link insurance companies to them.  For further details regarding this
 process, please refer to the Integrated Billing IIV Interface User
 Guide."  In addition, this message was made conditional, so it only
 displays if new payers are listed.
 
 19)Enhancement: CHANGED INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR APPOINTMENT EXTRACT
    ------------
 Prior to this patch, Inpatient appointments were excluded from the
 Appointment Extract.  Inpatient appointments will now be included as
 valid criteria for this extract.
 
 20)Problem: ADDRESSED RESPONSE PROCESSING ISSUE
    --------
 The response processing routines included a utility to strip off
 extraneous encoding characters from the end of data fields that were sent
 by Austin.  During some internal testing, it was determined that under
 certain circumstances it would strip off relevant trailing escape
 sequences.  The code was modified to only remove the unnecessary
 characters.  This was not causing problems for IIV, but could potentially
 be a factor in future releases.
 
 21)Problem:  ADDRESSED RESPONSE PROCESSING ISSUE (NOIS: WPB-0904-32212)
    --------
 The Extract process was aborting when accessing a corrupted appointment
 subfile (#44.001).  The corrupted appointment subfile included a blank
 internal Patient IEN/DFN in the .01 field.  The code was modified to
 skip the corrupted appointment rather than abort the processing.
