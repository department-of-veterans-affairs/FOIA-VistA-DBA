Description:
============

 This patch will correct two Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Special 
 Handling issues.  One problem occurs while completing the prescription via
 the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and
 one while refilling a prescription via the Barcode Batch Prescription
 Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option on the PSO BARCODE MENU.  This patch will
 also correct a null subscript error while verifying a prescription via the
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
  
  
 1. NOIS: SBY-0204-32205     ERROR - OERR+5^PSOVER
  
 Problem:
 --------
 While performing the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] option, a null subscript was encountered when trying to verify a
 non-verified prescription order.  This only happens following the scenario
 below:
  
   1. While editing a non-verified prescription order, select the hidden
      option PI to view patient information.
   2. Select DD to view Detailed Allergies.
   3. Select an item from the Allergy list.
   4. Quit until you are at the prescription display and enter the hidden
      option VF to verify this drug.  The null subscript error occurs here.
   5. Follow the same steps as above in 1-4, but instead of one drug,
      use the speed method of entering multiple drugs to verify. This may 
      not produce the null subscript error, but may produce unpredictable
      results.  When returning from the Allergy list, a different drug
      could be displayed for verifying instead of the original drug chosen
      prior to the PI option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine has been corrected to keep track of the order number it is
 on when going between verifying an order and viewing the Detailed
 Allergy/ADR List of items.
  
  
 2. NOIS: BOI-0904-52115 Dr. able to order T-3 with 1 yr's refill from CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An error occurs when the prescription is completed/finished after 
 receiving an order comes from Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS)
 for a controlled substance drug in which the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3)
 in the DRUG file (#50) is coded as 3AB.  The Days supply is set to 90 with
 3 refills.  The prescription is allowed to be completed with the 3 refills
 and a 90 Day Supply, i.e. a year supply.  In this example the drug should
 have been restricted to 1 refill at the 90 day supply.
  
 Schedule 3-5 controlled substances should be restricted to a total of 6 
 months supply or 5 maximum refills, whichever comes first.  Schedule 2 
 does not allow refills at all and other drugs with DEA containing an "F" 
 should also not allow refills.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Finishing routine has been corrected to properly check the DEA field
 in concert with the Days supply value and apply restrictions accordingly.
  
  
 3. NOIS: PAL-1004-60171     REFILLED RX WITH NO REILL LEFT
        & BOI-1204-51334     Prescriptions with negative refills remaining
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option would
 allow refills for drugs whose DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field in the DRUG
 (#50) file contained "F".  The "F" in that field should have prevented the
 drug from being refilled.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine has been corrected to properly check the DEA field and apply 
 restrictions accordingly.  This is to insure that a drug will not be 
 refilled based on changes that may have been made to the DEA field to 
 prevent this.

       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
       DDs, templates, etc.) 
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
