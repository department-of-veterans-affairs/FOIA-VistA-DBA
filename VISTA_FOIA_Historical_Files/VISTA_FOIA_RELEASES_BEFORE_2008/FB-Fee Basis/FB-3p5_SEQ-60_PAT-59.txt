Subject: FEE EXCLUSION IN PATIENT MERGE AND FILE 162.94 DESCRIPTION NOT ACCURATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem encountered when the DUPLICATE 
 RECORD MERGE process is moving the FEE ID CARD NUMBER from one 
 patient FB record to the target patient FB record. 
      
 Also, the description for file 162.94 in the Data Dictionary is 
 corrected.

 ASSOCIATED NOIS:

 2. ISB-0403-31419     File 162.94 description not accurate
      
 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. MAC-0303-61067     Fee Exclusion in Patient Merge
   
    Problem:
    -------
    When performing the Duplicate Record Merge, the process fails 
    if the FEE ID CARD NUMBER field (#.5) in the FEE BASIS PATIENT 
    file (#161) is in the 'FROM' record and not the 'TO' record. 
    The Input Transform on the FEE ID CARD NUMBER field (#.5) does 
    not allow the value to be added to the 'TO' record when it 
    already exists in the 'FROM' record. A modification to the FBPMRG
    special processing routine for duplicate record merge fixes this 
    issue.
      
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Add code to the Fee Basis Merge software to copy the FEE ID CARD 
    NUMBER from the "FROM" patient record to the "TO" patient record 
    using FILEMAN to bypass the INPUT TRANFORM. 
      
 2. ISB-0403-31419     File 162.94 description not accurate 
      
    Problem:
    -------
    A previous patch (FB*3.5*32) added the new Disapproval Reasons 
    File Enter/Edit [FBUC DISAPPROVAL REASONS FILE] option. This 
    option allows a user to enter or edit data in the Fee Basis 
    Unauthorized Disapproval Reasons file (#162.94) so the 
    descriptions that print on a disposition letter can be locally 
    modified. The new option is attached to the Supervisor Main 
    Menu [FBAA SUPERVISOR OPTIONS].
      
    The description in the data dictionary was not noticed previously 
    and thus did not get updated to remove the "*** ENTRIES SHOULD NOT 
    BE ADDED TO THIS FILE ***" when new functionality was added.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Update Data Dictionary to correct this problem.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system.  Installation time
 will be less than 2 minutes.
    
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
    
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
   
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
   
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
