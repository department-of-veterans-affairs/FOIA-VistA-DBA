Description:
============

 Problems and Issues:
 ====================
  
 1. [PSI-03-055] Modifies algorithm calculating patient creatinine 
 clearance for CPRS order checks.  The old algorithm was based on
 a formula from p. 616 Clinician's Pocket Reference by Leonard Gomella:
    CrCl (male) = (140 - age) x (weight in kg)       
                  ----------------------------
                    (serum creatinine) x 72
   CrCl (female) = 0.85 x CrCl (male) 
  
 The new algorithm uses adjusted body weight if patient height is > 60 
 inches.  Approved by the CPRS Clinical Workgroup, it is based on a
 modified Cockcroft-Gault formula.  For more information:
    http://www.ascp.com/public/pubs/tcp/1999/jan/cockcroft.shtml
  
    CrCl (male) = (140 - age) x (adj body weight* in kg)       
                  --------------------------------------
                    (serum creatinine) x 72
   * If patient height is not greater than 60 inches, actual body weight 
     is used.
   CrCl (female) = 0.85 x CrCl (male) 
  
 To calculate adjusted body weight, the following equations are used:
 Ideal body weight (IBW) = 50 kg x (for men) or 45 kg x (for women) + 
                           2.3 x (height in inches - 60) 
 Adjusted body weight (Adj. BW) if the ratio of actual BW/IBW > 1.3 =
    (0.3 x (Actual BW - IBW)) + IBW
 Adjusted body weight if the ratio of actual BW/IBW is not > 1.3 =
    IBW or Actual BW (whichever is less) 
  
 2. [CPH-1103-40914] Adds two new medications to the list of 
 metformins that trigger order checks: AVANDAMET and  METAGLIP. 
  
 3. [CQ 2417] Support triggering subsequent alerts when lab profile
 results are not entered in same resulting session (results trickle in.)
