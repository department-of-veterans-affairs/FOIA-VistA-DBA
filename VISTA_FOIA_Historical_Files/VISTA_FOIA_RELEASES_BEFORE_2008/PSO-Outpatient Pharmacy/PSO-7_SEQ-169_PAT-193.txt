Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This is a follow-up patch for the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI)
 Patch.
  
 It addresses the following:
  
 1. PSO*7*156 provided a two-way interface that returns dispensing
 information to VistA from the dispensing machine that updates the 
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) when dispensing of medication is completed.
 When developing this new two-way interface the Label/Profile Monitor
 Reprint [PSO B] option was not enhanced to send label reprints to the
 external interface.  BRX-0803-10283
  
  
 2. PSO*7*156 provided a two-way interface that returns dispensing
 information to VistA from the dispensing machine that updates the 
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) when dispensing of medication is completed.
 Since being released to the field, it has been determined that additional
 data validation checks were needed on the data being returned.
 This patch includes those additional data validation checks.
  
 3. When viewing a prescription using the View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW]
 option, the initiator of activity does not display, if viewing from
 the screen profile, it does display. MAC-1104-61559

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
  Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
  install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy V 7.0 users are on the system.
  Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.  Suggested time to install
  is during non-peak hours for Outpatient Pharmacy users.  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should

 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:

      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
