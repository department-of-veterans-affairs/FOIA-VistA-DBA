Subject: ADD STOP CODE TO OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION STOP CODE EXCEPTION FILE (#409.45)

Description:
============

 Radiology clinics can not set up an imaging location tied to stop code

 OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION STOP CODE EXCEPTION (#409.45) file. This patch adds 
 this stop code to file 409.45 and builds the proper nodes and cross 
 references.
