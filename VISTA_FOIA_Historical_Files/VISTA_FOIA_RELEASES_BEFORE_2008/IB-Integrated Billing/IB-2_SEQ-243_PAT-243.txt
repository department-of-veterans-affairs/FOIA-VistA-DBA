Subject: FILE 399 DD UPDATE AND IB TECH MANUAL UPDATE

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch covers three issues. (1) Two fields in the BILL/CLAIMS
 (#399) file have the exact same name. (2) In the Cancel Bill option,
 if you select a bill to cancel and then decide not to cancel, the user id
 and cancellation date are still recorded. (3) The Integrated Billing
 Technical Manual did not include journaling information for the ^IBAM
 and ^IBAT globals.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
   
 1. VAC-1003-22358   File #399 (Duplicate Text Field Names: #204 & #450) 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    Two separate fields in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file, #204 and #450,
    are both named FORM LOCATOR 2. This is basically a technical issue
    and does not affect any functionality of VistA, but it needs to be
    corrected.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Field #204 is related to the old UB-82 billing format, and field #450
    is related to the newer UB-92 format. In order to create separate
    names, those distinctions are added to the new field names. The 
    names will be changed to UB82 FORM LOCATOR 2 and UB92 FORM 
    LOCATOR 2. This is primarily a data dictionary change, but may be 
    observed on any screen that displays the LABEL for either of those 
    fields. One place that it can be seen is on screen 8 of the Enter/Edit 
    Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option after selecting item 
    3 on that screen.
   
 2. HWH-0104-42321   CANCEL BILL?: n  (NO) files date anyway
   
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user selects a bill to cancel but changes their mind and enters
    "no" at the end, a message displays "<NO ACTION TAKEN>" but the 
    "DATE BILL CANCELLED" and "BILL CANCELLED BY" fields are populated 
    anyway. The bill can still be authorized in AR but it can't be printed 
    in IB.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The prompt which reads:
       LAST CHANCE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND...
       CANCEL BILL?: 
    relates to field #16 - CANCEL BILL? in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file.  
    Any entry in this field activates triggers for fields #17 - DATE BILL
    CANCELLED and #18 - BILL CANCELLED BY. Those triggers do not check
    to see if the answer was NO. They are currently designed to stuff the
    date and user id no matter what. The problem has been fixed by modifying
    the trigger code to abort when the user answers NO.
   
 3. FGH-0903-31133   QUESTION CONCERNING JOURNALING
   
    Problem:
    --------
    A user noted that the Integrated Billing Technical Manual did not
    include the IBAM and IBAT globals in the journalling instructions.
    These globals were added by IB patches IB*2.0*156 and IB*2.0*115 and
    the documentation was never updated to include them.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The journaling requirements were discussed with the development team
    and it was determined that ^IBAM should be journalled and that it
    would be optional for ^IBAT. The Integrated Billing Technical Manual has 
    been updated and this is an INFORMATION ONLY announcement of the 
    document change. If sites have not already done so, they should add 
    ^IBAM to the list of globals that are journalled. In addition to the 
    journalling information, the file names and file descriptions are added
    to the file list in the Integrated Billing Technical Manual.
   
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
   
 1. VAC-1003-22358   File #399 (Duplicate Text Field Names: #204 & #450)
     Field names changed from:

     399,450       FORM LOCATOR 2         UF3;1 FREE TEXT
   
     Field names changed to:
     399,204       UB82 FORM LOCATOR 2    U1;4 FREE TEXT
     399,450       UB92 FORM LOCATOR 2    UF3;1 FREE TEXT
   
     Input Templates recompiled:
     IB SCREEN8
     IB SCREEN82
   
 2. HWH-0104-42321   CANCEL BILL?: n  (NO) files date anyway
     The trigger cross-references for field #16 [CANCEL BILL?] are 
     changed from unconditional to conditional. The condition is:
     CANCEL BILL?="YES".  No other change is made to the trigger.
   
 3. FGH-0903-31133   QUESTION CONCERNING JOURNALING
   
    The new text in the Globals to Journal section of the Integrated Billing 
    Technical Manual will read as follows:
   
  The IB, IBA, IBAM, IBE, and IBT globals must be journalled. In a future
  release, we intend to move all dynamic files from IBE to IBA so that it
  will not be necessary to journal IBE. Journaling of the IBAT global is
  optional.
   
    In addition, file names, numbers, global locations and descriptions
    will be inserted in the appropriate spots in the 'File List with
    Description' section to cover the 7 files using the ^IBAM and ^IBAT
    globals, as follows:

                                   The entries are used to extract and format

                                   will be used to determine if a patient has
                                   reached his copay cap for the month or year.

                                   rx copayments, including amounts billed and
                                   not billed.  There should be transactions
                                   stored in this file for both this facility
                                   and other treating facilities through out

                                   stored here is the cap amounts for outpatient
                                   medication copayment.  Once a patient has
                                   reached his cap, billing will stop for the
                                   remainder of the period indicated.
