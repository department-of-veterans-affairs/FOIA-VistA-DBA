Subject: INVALID CROSS REF

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Description:
 ============
  
 A problem exists in the Drug File (#50). If a VAPN (VA Product Name) xref 
 is greater than 30 characters it is not killed off when unmatching through 
 PDM (Pharmacy Data Management) or NDF (National Drug File) options. 
 The maximum length for the VAPN xref should be 30 according to the 
 Data Dictionary. The VAPN index uses the VA Product Name for the 
 drug. The index was set incorrectly by a previous patch (PSN*4*43).

 The pre-install routine in the patch will kill off the existing VAPN 
 index and re-create it using fileman. The pre-install routine will be 
 deleted after it executes.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
  
 This patch should be run in the off hours with Pharmacy users off the 
 system.
  
 Installation will take less than 15 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
     [XPD MAIN]:
  
           Edits and Distribution...
           Utilities...
           Installation...
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation 
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*80):
  
     a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global. 
     b.  Print  Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.  
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will  
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not save
         any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*80
  
     a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO.
     b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
     c.  When prompted to select the options you would like to place out 
         of order, enter the following:
  
              PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT     Drug Enter/Edit
              PSNDRUG                 Rematch / Match Single Drugs
  
 6.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
