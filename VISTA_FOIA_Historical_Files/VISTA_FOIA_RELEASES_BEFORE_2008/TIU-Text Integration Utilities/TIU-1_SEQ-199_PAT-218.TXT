Subject: TIU ACTIVE TITLE CLEANUP REPORT v2 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch provides a report and automated cleanup utility to assist the 
 Data Standardization's efforts to clean and standardize TIU Document Titles.
 
 TIU*1*218 is an enhancement to TIU*1*209 that clears up some confusion
 with the first version of the report.
 
 This version has a more detailed header and uses a VA FileMan Database Server
 (DBA) API to update file #8925.1 instead of a direct set of the global.
 
 *** If sites have already inactivated their unused document titles using
 *** TIU*1*209, this report does NOT need to be run again.
  
 This patch is an important precursor to TIU*1*211, which maps local document 
 titles to Standard Titles in preparation for the upcoming unified Clinical 
 Data Repository/Health Data Repository of computable patient data. Using 
 this report and the automatic cleanup feature that comes with it will 
 greatly simplify the work required for document title mapping. 
  
 The report and cleanup utility will analyze the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file 
 (#8925.1) and provide an automated process to inactivate the appropriate TIU
 titles.
  
 Details for invoking the routine and option associated with this patch can 
 be found in the post-installation instructions below.

 Post Install Instructions:
 =========================
 This report can be run using the new menu option, Active Title Cleanup Report 
 [TIU ACTIVE TITLE CLEANUP], on the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE
 MENU], or directly from the programmer prompt by entering D EN^TIUPS209.
  
 When running the routine, the following recommendations are made:
  
      - Users may be on the system
  
      - The job should be run at a time that does not conflict with a system 
        backup
  
      - Processing times for this task will vary considerably, depending on
        the load on your system and the number of entries processed in the TIU
        DOCUMENT FILE (#8925) and TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION FILE (#8925.1).
  
 This routine should not be deleted after it is initially used.  
 The report can be run as often as needed to track the frequency of usage for
 TIU Document Definitions and periodic inactivation of unused titles.
  
 The report will display all currently ACTIVE titles along with the number of
 instances that title has been used in the previous 365 days, the last day
 that title has been used, along with the last AUTHOR/DICTATOR of that entry.
  
 INACTIVE titles will only appear on the report if that title has been used
 in the previous 365 days.
  
 DOCUMENT TITLES (#8925.1) that have an invalid #.01 Field will have the IEN
 displayed at the end of the report.
  
 ACTIVE titles that have a document type field that points to a document 
 (in File #8925.1) type other than TITLE [DOC] will have the IEN, NAME, & TYPE
 displayed at the end of the report.
 
 ACTIVE titles that contain a 0 (zero) or NULL #.01 field will have
 the DOCUMENT IEN displayed at the end of the report.
  
 All ACTIVE titles with a count of 0 (zero) will be selected for automatic
 inactivation ONLY AFTER USER INTERVENTION DURING THE REPORT PROCESS.  No 
 changes will be made to file #8925.1 without consent from the user.
  
 Specific titles may be selected that will NOT be INACTIVATED even if their 
 usage count for the last year is 0.
  
 Sample output of the report is as shown below:
 
 PLEASE NOTE:  The count "# of Docs Incorrect .01 Field" in the header may be
 larger than the details at the end of the report.  The end of the report will
 ONLY show the entries with errors; there may be several documents pointing
 to the same erroneous title, but that title will only be listed ONCE.  To
 verify the results use the example below.
 ---------------------
 (HEADER indicates 10 documents)
 
     # of Docs Incorrect .01 Field  :          10 (See End of Report)
 
 (End of Report indicates ONLY 2 entries from 8925.1)
 
 The following IENs from File #8925.1 have an incorrect #.04 Field.

 557   UROLOGY CONSULT [DOCUMENT CLASS]
