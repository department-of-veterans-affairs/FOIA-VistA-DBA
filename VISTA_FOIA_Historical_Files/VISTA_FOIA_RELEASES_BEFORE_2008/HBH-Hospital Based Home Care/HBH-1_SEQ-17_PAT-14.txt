      Associated E3Rs:
      ===============
  
      HBH*1*14 will complete resolution of E3R #11728 which requests
      allowing unlimited ICD9 codes.  Unlimited CPT codes were addressed in
      previously released patch:  HBH*1*15.
  
  
      Test Sites:
      ==========
  
      Little Rock AR  (alpha)
      Albuquerque NM  (beta)
      Buffalo NY  (beta)
      Salt Lake UT  (beta)
  
  
      1)  Remove 5 ICD9 Diagnosis (DX) code maximum and allow unlimited DX
          codes in HBHC VISIT file (#632).  Convert 5 individual DX code
          fields (Diagnosis 1 thru Diagnosis 5, fields #16 thru #20
          respectively)  to DX multiple field (#33).  Existing DX data will
          be moved from individual fields to multiple by post-install
          routine, HBHCPS14.  Data Dictionary entries will be deleted for
          fields 16-20.  E3R #11728 resolution.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  Add DX field (#33) to HBHC VISIT file
        (#632).  HBHCPS14
  
  
      2)  Update 'siphoned' visit file data process (utilizing AIT
          interface) to accommodate DX multiple data structure change.
          Remove obsolete error messages from visit data processing  (e.g.
          Diagnosis > 5).  Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE] option.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCAPPT
  
  
      3)  Update print/display/sort criteria of DX codes to read from the
          multiple field (#33) versus individual fields on report options:
  
            Patient Visit Data Report  (80) [HBHCRP3]
            Visit Data by Date Range Report  (80) [HBHCRP4]
            ICD9 Code/Dx Text by Date Range Report  (80) [HBHCR19A]
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP3, HBHCRP4, HBHCUTL3, HBHCR19A,
        & HBHCR19B
  
  
      4)  Update Austin transmit record creation to obtain data from DX
          multiple field (#33) versus individual DX code fields.  Create
          separate transmit records containing a maximum of 5 DX codes each
          for visits with greater than 5 DX codes.  Transmit File to Austin
          [HBHCXMT] option.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMV, HBHCXMV1
  
  
      5)  Number of Visits Total information on Print Transmit History
          Report  (80) [HBHCR15A] option shows user which visit records
          contain greater than 5 DX codes and/or greater than 10 CPT codes.
          (Please refer to HBH*1*15 User Info in patch description for CPT
          code example, including report sample with explanation.)  One
          visit equates to one 'Visit Form 4 transmit record' if visit has 5
          or less DX codes and/or 10 or less CPT codes.  Greater than 5 DX
          and/or 10 CPT codes creates a one-to-many relationship between one
          visit and potentially many Visit Form 4 transmit records.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBH*1*15 modifications to HBHCR15A &
        HBHCR15B handle > 5 DX without further changes being required.  Info
        included here for informational purposes only.
  
  
      6)  Remove obsolete variable, HBHCEVDT, from HBHCXMA1 routine.
      Build/Verify Transmission File [HBHCFILE] option.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCXMA1
  
 
      7)  Resolve NOIS:  DAY-0700-40075, Add ** around patch number (e.g.
      **16**) in routine second line, which were inadvertently omitted in
      HBH*1*16.  Checksum values do not change with this edit.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP6, HBHCRP9
  
  
      8)  Resolve NOIS:  BRX-0700-12823, PROCESS+5^HBHCUTL2, null subscript
      error.  Provider Census Report  (132) [HBHCRP9] option.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCUTL2
  
  
      9)  Remove S from Visits in HBHCTXT variable.  Variable used when
      printing provider total line in Visit Data by Date Range Report  (80)
      [HBHCRP4] option.  Also removed repetitive printing of CPT code field
      heading.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHCRP4
  
  
     10)  HBHC ERROR MESSAGES FOR VISITS file (#633.1) is exported with
          DD, Read, Write, Delete, & LAYGO file access set to @.  It had
          previously been exported with no file access restrictions.  This
          allows this file to match the HBPC Technical Manual file security
          info.
  
        Solution/Routine(s) changed:  HBHC ERROR MESSAGES FOR VISITS file
        (#633.1) DD, Read, Write, Delete, & LAYGO file access set to @.
  
  
     11)  Updated HBPC User & Technical Manuals are available.  The
          documentation changes exist in two files which can be downloaded.
  
          The files are:

      Patch Installation:
      ==================
  
      Only HBPC  (Home Based Primary Care, formerly HBHC Hospital Based
      Home Care)  users need to be off the system.  Patch installation time
      will vary depending upon how much visit data there is to convert.
      (Little Rock took 22 minutes in production account.)  There is no
      recommended time of day for installation.  Additional disk space
      required for database structural change is minimal.
  
        1.  If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
        2.  Use INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to load the
            KIDS patch onto the system.
  
        3.  From Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
            the Installation menu.
  
            From Installation menu, you may choose to use the following
            options prior to installation, select INSTALL NAME  HBH*1.0*14
  
              a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
              b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
  
              c.  Backup a Transport Global.
  
        4.  Use Install Package(s) option under the Installation menu,
            select package  HBH*1.0*14.
