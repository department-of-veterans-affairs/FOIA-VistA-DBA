Subject: Fix for Log of Needlestick Incident report

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to fix a bug in the Log of Needlestick 
 Incidents Option
 
 This patch does NOT contain a new GUI version, only a KIDS build.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
   
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 FAV-0704-71814     New Type of Incident Codes - Placing Case on Needlestick Log
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------- 
 The only type of incidents that are to be included on the Log of Needlestick 
 Incidents report are:  Hollow Bore Needlestick, Sharps Exposure, Exposure to 
 Body Fluids/Splash, and Suture Needlestick.  OOPS*2.0*4 added two (2) new 
 entries to the ASISTS CRITICAL TRACKING ISSUES File (#2261.2) which were 
 not excluded from the report.  This patch corrects this problem so that 
 ASISTS claims with the new entries: Not Elsewhere Classified and Non Patient 
 Care do not appear on the report.
  
 Two (2) routines have been changed although only one (1) option is affected 
 with the bug.  The second routine (OOPSGUI9) was modified to maintain 
 consistent logic between the Delphi and M logic.
  
   
 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL 
 ------------------
 The KIDS build will be distributed in the normal fashion. This patch does 
 NOT contain a new GUI version, however, if the current version of the GUI 
 portion is needed , all VA Medical Centers are encouraged to use the TCPIP 
 FTP functionality to obtain the GUI portion of the software from one of the 
 following OI Field Office ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:
