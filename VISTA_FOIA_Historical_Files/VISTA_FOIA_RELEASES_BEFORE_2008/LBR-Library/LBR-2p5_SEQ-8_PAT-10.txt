Subject: Menu and Template Corrections

Category: 
  - Other
  - Sort Template

Description:
============

 This patch addresses problems discovered during ITC2 (Integrated Test
 Cycle, phase 2) testing of the CoreFLS Library package. Installation will
 remove the option [LBRY ASSIGN COPY] 'no title' from the 'Library 
 Management' [LBRY MANAGER] menu.  It will also correct the prompts
 displayed in the 'Missing Issues List' [LBRY MISSING ISSUE] report. This
 patch will remove one Library option and correct one sort template. No
 routines are sent along with this patch.
  
 Two problems were found during ITC2 testing in the developmental Bay
 Pines test account:
  
 Problem 1: The 'Library Management' [LBRY MANAGER] menu contained a
 faulty menu item.  Users without the LBRY LOCAL VENDOR key would get 
 kicked out of the 'Library Management' [LBRY MANAGER] menu when typing an
 'A' at the Select Option prompt.  Users holding the LBRY LOCAL VENDOR key
 would be prompted for selection of 2 options, one being blank, and the
 other being 'Add a local vendor (COREFLS)' [LBRY LOCAL VENDOR ADD].
  
 Resolution: The menu option [LBRY ASSIGN COPY] will be deleted and removed
 from the Library Management [LBRY MANAGER] menu.
  
 Problem 2: The prompts displayed when running the 'Missing Issues List'
 [LBRY MISSING ISSUE] option while in CoreFLS were incorrect.
  
 Resolution: The prompts will now mirror what was previously displayed
 during vendor lookup.
