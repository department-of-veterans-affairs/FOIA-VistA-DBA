  REMEDY OVERVIEW
  -------------
  1.   HD97950        Unable to enter new ROC
        
        Problem:
        -------
        Sites are seeing Contact Numbers that do not follow the 
        proper format and the system will not allow them to enter
        contact numbers after the incorrectly formatted
        numbers appear.
        The Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS) rehosting team has
        reviewed this issue and it has been identified as a High Risk item
        because the incorrect format can not be migrated to the rehosted
        system.
        
        Resolution
        ----------
        A post install routine, QAC20PST, will correct any existing
        incorrectly formatted Contact Numbers. The Patient
        Representative package is currently being rehosted so the
        problem causing the incorrectly formatted Contact Numbers
        will not be addressed. Sites are able to use the Patient
        Representative application fully when the incorrectly
        formatted Contact Numbers are corrected. 
       
        During installation of this patch the user will be asked: 
        "Queue the post-install to run at what Date@Time: ". If the 
        prompt is not answered, the patch WILL NOT be installed.
        After the post-install routine is run to completion at the 
        time the user indicated, a MailMan message with the subject:
        "QAC*2*20 POST INSTALL RESULTS" will be sent to the person
        installing the patch.
  
        *** NOTE: THE POST-INSTALL SHOULD BE QUEUED TO RUN AT OFF-
            PEAK HOURS. ***
