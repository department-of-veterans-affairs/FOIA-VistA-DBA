Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 
 This patch corrects the following problems:
  
        1.  NOIS HIN-0900-40188, describes a problem of when using the 
            menu "User Class Management" [USR CLASS MANAGEMENT MENU] and 
            option "List Membership by Class" [USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS].
            The option would allow a clinician to add additional users to
            a inactive class.  This patch will disable the option "ADD" if 
            the class is inactive.  
 
        2.  NOIS PUG-0800-52041, BIR-1000-31740 describes a problem when  
            using the menu "User Class Management" [USR CLASS MANAGEMENT  
            MENU] and the option, "List Membership by User" [USR LIST 
            MEMBERSHIP BY USER].  When the protocol "Change View" [USR CLASS
            ACTION CHANGE VIEW] was used to select a new user it would 
            display duplicate names, which was in error, requiring the user 
            to select the correct name.  This patch will correct the duplicate 
            names from appearing when using the "CHANGE VIEW" protocol.
 
        3.  The patch will include 1 routine and two protocols.
