Subject: RE-ENABLE SPECIFIC KATRINA FUNCTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the following two Accounts Receivable functions,
 which automatically became inactivated on 4/30/06 and are related to
 veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina:
  
 1. Option Emergency Response Report [RC EMERGENCY RESPONSE REPORT]
  
    This option is used to list the active account balance of all
    veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina.  As of 4/30/06, this
    report no longer included any veterans.  This report has been
    modified to include all veterans who have been flagged with the
    Hurricane Katrina indicator in the Patient (#2) file, so veterans
    affected by Hurricane Katrina will again be listed on this report.
  
 2. Patch PRCA*4.5*241 Post-Initialization process (routine RCKATP)
  
    Some sites have continued to flag veterans with the Hurricane
    Katrina indicator in the Patient (#2) file since the installation
    of patch PRCA*4.5*241.  After flagging new veterans, the sites
    would re-run the patch, PRCA*4.5*241, post-initialization process,
    in order to exempt interest charges and cancel co-payment charges
    for these veterans.  Re-running the patch PRCA*4.5*241 post-
    initialization process only worked through 4/30/06, after which
    time the process did not recognize any veterans as having been
    affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The post-initialization process was
    modified to recognize any veteran that has been flagged with the
    Hurricane Katrina indicator in the Patient (#2) file as having
    been affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Thus, if the post-
    initialization process is re-run, it will recognize veterans
    as having been affected by Hurricane Katrina, regardless of the
    current date.
  
    Note that the patch, PRCA*4.5*241, post-initialization can be re-run,
    if a site has flagged additional veterans with the Hurricane Katrina
    indicator since the original installation of patch PRCA*4.5*241,
    without fear of exempting interest or canceling charges a second
    time for previously-flagged veterans.  If a site wishes to re-run
    the patch, PRCA*4.5*241, post-initialization process, an IRM staff
    member must initiate the process by typing 'D POST^RCKATP' in
    programmer mode (with the common local variables DUZ, DT, and U
    already set).  This command will immediately queue a job to run
    the post-initialization job for patch PRCA*4.5*241.  An example
    of this process follows:
  
    >D POST^RCKATP
  
  
     >>> Queuing the post-initialization to run now...
      >> Queued as task #3880324.
     >
  
     Note that the queued job will send a bulletin to the IRM staff
     person, as well as the members of the PRCA ADJUSTMENT TRANS mail
     group, at the completion of the task.
