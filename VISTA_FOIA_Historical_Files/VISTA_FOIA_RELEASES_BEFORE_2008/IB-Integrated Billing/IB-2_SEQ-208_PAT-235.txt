Subject: UNBILLED AMOUNTS REPORT CHANGES FOR EOAM

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The Department of the Treasury has directed all federal agencies to 
 accelerate SF 224 (Statement of Transactions), and other external
 reporting at the End of the Accounting Month (EOAM). To comply with these
 external reporting changes, VA's Financial Management System (FMS) EOAM
 processing cycle will be changed so that the workday overlap will be
 eliminated. This requires changes in the schedules for producing
 interfacing files that are needed in FMS at the end of the month to
 provide for accurate and timely EOAM financial reporting. Beginning with
 September 2003, EOAM will be processed on the last workday of the calendar
 month, and all interfacing EOAM files must be received at the Austin
 Automation Center (AAC) by 8 PM (CT) on the last workday of the month.
  
 To accomplish this, it has been determined that VA medical facilities will
 have to cut off their monthly processing 3 workdays from the end of the
 month. This will allow them the time they need to generate data and 
 reports, as well as reconcile the data, in order to meet the submission 
 deadline. This cutoff only affects the VistA Accounts Receivable (AR) 
 application package. Any AR processing that occurs after the cutoff date 
 will be held up within VistA and not sent to the AAC until the first day 
 of the following month. This is necessary to allow medical centers to 
 close their monthly processes. The accounting month in AR will now 
 encompass the last three workdays of the previous month up to the last 
 three work days of the current month.
  
 This enhancement will modify the following in the Unbilled Amounts
 Report as follows:
  
 1. The Monthly Unbilled Amounts Report, which currently generates on the
    first of the month with all of the Diagnostic Measures reports, will
    now generate separately from the rest of the reports. This report will
    now generate on the day after the end of the accounting month (EOAM),
    and generate for the same time frame as the ARDC, Bad Debt, OIG and FMS
    reports. 
  
 Routines IBJDE and IBTUBO have been modified to accommodate these changes.
  
 2. File IB DM EXTRACT REPORTS (#351.7), has been modified to set the
    beginning and ending dates to accommodate the changes to the EOAM cycle
    for the automatic generation of the Unbilled Amounts Report.
  
 Changes have been made to the following fields in file (#351.7).
  
 Fields            1         INPUT VARIABLE  (multiple)
 Subfield:         1         INPUT STATEMENT
 Variables:                  IBBDT and IBEDT
