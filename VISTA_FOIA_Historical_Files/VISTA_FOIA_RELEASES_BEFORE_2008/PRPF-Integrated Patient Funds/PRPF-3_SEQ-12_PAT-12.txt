  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description: 
============

  This patch will remove obsolete PFAS (Personal Funds) options that are
  still available from a previous version of the Personal Funds package. 
  Also, an invalid entry in file PATIENT FUNDS FORMS (#470.2) will be
  deleted.
  
  In addition, a previous patch PRPF*3*11 inadvertently deleted two Medicine
  package menu options. This patch will re-create those two menu options.
  
  Note: This is a mandatory patch and should be installed even if you have 
  or have not installed patch PRPF*3*11.
