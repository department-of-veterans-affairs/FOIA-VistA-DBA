Subject: Update VistA RIS client protocol receiving reports via TCP/IP  

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The following information is only relevant at OpenVMS/Cache sites
 that integrate Agfa TalkStation or Dictaphone PowerScribe speech
 recognition systems with version 5.0 of VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine.
  
 To ensure the reliability of TalkStation or PowerScribe on an 
 OpenVMS/Cache system, we recommend updating the LOGICAL LINK (#770.7) 
 field for the vendor specific protocol in the PROTOCOL (#101) file. The 
 protocol is 'RA TALKLINK TCP REPORT' for sites running TalkStation, and 
 is 'RA PSCRIBE TCP REPORT' for sites running PowerScribe.
  
 The procedure to be followed when editing logical link information 
 associated with a protocol is documented below. The procedure in the
 example uses a TalkStation protocol but the same procedure should
 be followed for editing a PowerScribe specific protocol.
  
 In our examples, we will use the logical link names exported by the VistA
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application. For the TalkStation application
 we have exported RA-TALK and TALK-RA. For the PowerScribe application we
 have exported RA-PSCRIBE and PSCRIBE-RA. Your site may have named them
 differently, so be alert to which logical links you should change.
  
 For TalkStation, the current logical link associated with the RA TALKLINK
 TCP REPORT client protocol is TALK-RA. The new logical link value will be
 'VAxxx' where the 'VAxxx' is the name of the multi-listener at your site.
 For example, the Hines VA has the multi-listener defined as 'VAHIN'.
 Questions regarding the multi-listener should be referred to your
 facility's IRM staff.
  
 STEP 1. SHUT DOWN TALKSTATION/POWERSCRIBE AND APPROPRIATE LINKS
  
  For TALKSTATION:
  
   a. Shutdown the TalkStation application.
   b. on the OpenVMS/Cache side, shutdown both logical links:
      'TALK-RA' and 'RA-TALK'
  
  For POWERSCRIBE:
  
   a. Shutdown the PowerScribe application.
   b. on the OpenVMS/Cache side, shutdown both logical links:
      'PSCRIBE-RA' and 'RA-PSCRIBE'
  
 STEP 2. CHANGE THE LOGICAL LINK OF THE PROTOCOL (example uses TalkStation)

  PROCESSING RTN: D ^RAHLTCPB
  
  ROUTING LOGIC:
  
  'VAxxx' is the name of the multi-listener logical link running at your 
  site on port 5000.
  
 STEP 3. EDIT TALKSTATION/POWERSCRIBE'S SYSTEM FILE
  
  For TALKSTATION:
  
   The TalkStation Administrator must use the 'RisHL7' tab on the 
   'TalkStationLink Properties' dialog box, to change the IP address and 
   Transmit port definitions to correspond to the site's multi-listener.
   Do NOT change the Order port definition.
  
  For POWERSCRIBE version 2.2:
  
   The PowerScribe Administrator must use PowerScribe's 'HL7
   Communications' configuration folder, to change the IP address and port
   definitions to correspond to the site's multi-listener. To navigate to
   the 'HL7 Communications' folder, first access the 'PowerScribe
   Administrator' dialog box. After you select the 'Systems' tab and click
   on the 'Advanced' button to bring up the 'Systems Parameters' box, you
   will need to select the 'HL7 Communications' folder on the left hand
   side of the dialogue box. This will then display the available
   parameters, including the 'RIS Server IP' and 'RIS Server IP Port'
   parameters under this folder on the right hand side.
  
  For POWERSCRIBE versions 3.0A, & 4.6:
  
   The PowerScribe Administrator must access PowerScribe's 'Setup Xpress' 
   application to change the IP address and port definitions to correspond
   to the site's multi-listener. To navigate to the 'Setup Xpress' 
   application, first access the 'PowerScribe Interface' dialog box. Then
   you select the 'Setup Xpress' application button in the top left 
   side of the open window. This will open the 'Setup Xpress' dialog
   box, click on the 'Upload Connection Wizard' button and click on the
   'Next' button. You will have accessed the 'Upload From Socket To Socket'
   dialog box. This will then display the following text boxes; 'RIS/HIS
   IP' and 'Port'. After entering 'RIS/HIS IP' and 'Port' information,
   click on the 'finish' button, close the 'SetupXpress' application, stop
   and restart the 'PowerXpress' application to have the changes take
   effect.
  
  
 STEP 4. START UP TALKSTATION/POWERSCRIBE AND ONLY THE VISTA OUTBOUND LINKS
  
  For TALKSTATION:
  
   a. Startup the TalkStation application.
   b. on the OpenVMS/Cache side, startup only logical link: 'RA-TALK'
  
  For POWERSCRIBE:
  
   a. Startup the PowerScribe application.
   b. on the OpenVMS/Cache side, startup only logical link: 'RA-PSCRIBE'
