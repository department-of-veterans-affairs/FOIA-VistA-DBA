 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 1. Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
    However, it is recommended that the patch be installed during
    non-peak time. It will take less than a minute to install the
    patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
  
 2. DSM/AXP sites - Review your mapped routine set. If the routine 
    in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section is mapped, disable mapping for
    the affected routine.
  
 3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
    option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
 4. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 5. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
    You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
    menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
  
                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Backup a Transport Global
  
    On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    option:

 6. DSM/AXP Sites - Answer NO to the question "Want to MOVE routines to
    other CPUs?"
