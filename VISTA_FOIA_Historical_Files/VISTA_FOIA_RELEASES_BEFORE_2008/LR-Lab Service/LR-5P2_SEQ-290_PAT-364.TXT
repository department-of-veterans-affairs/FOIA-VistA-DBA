Subject: LABORATORY PACKAGE PASSING INEXACT TIME TO CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*364 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*364 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*364 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 When a user is accessioning a test and enters a Collection time of 
 UNKNOWN, the time is flagged as INEXACT and is displayed with a Date 
 stamp and a Time stamp of '00:00' in the Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS).  This can be confusing or misleading since it is sometimes
 interpreted as Midnight.
  
 For this reason, the CPRS development team has asked that a new data item
 be passed from the Laboratory package to CPRS containing the Collection
 date and time to be displayed for all Chemistry and Microbiology tests.
 In the case of an UNKNOWN (INEXACT) time, only the date will be passed
 to CPRS.
  
 CPRS patch OR*3.0*243 is being developed so that CPRS can read the new 
 data item and display it as the Collection Date & Time.
  
 Sites which install this patch will not see this change in CPSR until 
 they also install OR*3.0*243.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
   Problem: 
   --------
   When the collection time for a test is entered as UNKNOWN, the
   collection time shown in CPRS will be '00:00' which can be confusing or
   misleading since it is sometimes interpreted as Midnight.
  
   For this reason, the CPRS development team has asked that a new data 
   item be passed from the Laboratory package to CPRS containing the
   Collection date and time to be displayed for all Chemistry and Micro-
   biology tests.  In the case of an UNKNOWN (INEXACT) time, only the date
   will be passed to CPRS.
  
   Solution:
   ---------
   3 Lab routines (LR7OGMG and LR7OGMM for 'Most Recent' and LR7OGG for
   'Worksheet') will be modified to pass an additional data item which will
   be the Collection date & time to be displayed in CPRS.
   
  
   If field #.02 DATE/TIME OBTAINED INEXACT of subfile #63.04 of file #63
   LAB DATA is set to YES (1), the time will not be included so that only
   the date will be displayed in CPRS.
  
  
   NOTE:  Patch OR*3.0*243 (Remedy ticket 123277) is addressing the CPRS
   side of this to pick up the new data item and display it.  Sites will 
   not see the changes introduced with this patch until they install 
   OR*3.0*243.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*364'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
