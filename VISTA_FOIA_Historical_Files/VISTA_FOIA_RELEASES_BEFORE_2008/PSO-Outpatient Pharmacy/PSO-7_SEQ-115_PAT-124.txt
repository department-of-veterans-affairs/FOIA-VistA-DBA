Subject: PRESCRIPTION EXPIRATION DATE MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS FROM ISSUE DATE W/O REFILLS 

Category: 
  - Enhancement ()
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 1. Currently, if a non-controlled substance prescription is entered with
    a day supply less than 5 days and there are no refills, the expiration
    date defaults to 5 days from the issue date.  If a controlled substance
    prescription is entered with a day supply less than 5 days without
    refills, the expiration date is the Issue Date plus the Days Supply.
    The primary problem is that when these prescriptions were being
    transmitted to the CMOPs and they were behind on dispensing, the
    prescriptions were being rejected because the prescriptions had
    already expired. The default of 5 is being changed to 30 to
    accommodate the CMOPs and to allow the patients to receive their
    medications in a timely manner. Prescriptions will no longer expire
    before 30 days elapses from the Issue Date when the day supply is
    less than 30 days and there are no refills.  If a minimum of 1 refill
    is entered the one year/six month rule still applies.
  
  
 2. This patch also includes a correction to initialize the line counter
    for the "SIG1" entries in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). Before this fix,
    the count could be incorrect sometimes which could cause problems for
    external interfaces.
  
  
 3. This patch corrects a problem that caused a null subscript error when 
    attempting to access the MEDS tab in the Computerized Patient Record 
    System (CPRS). This would happen if records were being created in the 
    PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) and an attempt was made to pull
    up the patient's medications in CPRS at the same moment.
