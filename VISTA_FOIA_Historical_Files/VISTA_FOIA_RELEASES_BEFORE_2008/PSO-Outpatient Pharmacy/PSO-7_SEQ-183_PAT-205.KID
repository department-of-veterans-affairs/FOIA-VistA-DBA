This patch adds the VUID (VHA Unique Identifiers) from the VA PRODUCT file
"BLD",5604,1,2,0)
(#50.68) to the Outpatient Pharmacy VDEF (Vista Data Extraction Framework)
"BLD",5604,1,3,0)
message that sends prescription information to the HDR (Health Data
"BLD",5604,1,4,0)
Repository). It also replaces Set of Code fields in the message with
"BLD",5604,1,5,0)
VUIDs. It also adds a check to screen out prescription information for
"BLD",5604,1,6,0)
test patients from being sent to the HDR.
