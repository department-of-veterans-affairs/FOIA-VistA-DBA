Subject: INTERACTION CHECKING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  During order entry using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM 
  BACKDOOR], Order checks are not being performed on Non-VA 
  Medications if other Active medications exist.  The possibility also 
  exists that when a 'critical interaction' exists and is displayed, this 
  critical interaction could be displayed for subsequent orders even 
  though a 'critical interaction' does not exist.  
  When entering an order via backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy or CPRS,
  a critical interaction could be skipped if a significant interaction
  exists for the same drugs.
  These issues will be resolved in this patch.

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders.
 
   Installation will take about 2 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*188) 
  
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*188.
   
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.  
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
   8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
