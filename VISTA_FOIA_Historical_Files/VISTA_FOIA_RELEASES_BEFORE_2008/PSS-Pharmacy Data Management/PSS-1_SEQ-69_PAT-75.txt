 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*75) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*75.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
