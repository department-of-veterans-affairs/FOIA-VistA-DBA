Subject: ACRP/AMIE DB CONVERSION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The changes in this patch are necessary to accommodate the forthcoming
 ACRP Database Conversion patch (SD*5.3*132.)  Once patch SD*5.3*132 is
 installed, the SCHEDULING VISITS file (#409.5), Outpatient Provider
 file(#409.44), and Outpatient Diagnosis file (#409.43) will no longer be
 maintained.
  
 As a result of these changes and prior to the installation of PATCH
 SD*5.3*132, all packages that access data in these 'old' files need to be
 modified to use the new Scheduling APIs to obtain valid data.
  
 Affected options in the AMIE package are:
      DVBA 7131 INFORMATION REQUEST       Request for 7131 Information
      DVBA 7131 NON-ADMITTED VETS         Request for 7131 Information
 (Non-
                                          admitted Vets)  
  
 These options will be modified to use the new APIs.  The APIs will
 transparently control whether the data is retrieved from the 'old'
 Scheduling files or from the associated V-files in PCE. There should be no
 noticeable changes to the output after the installation of this patch.
  
 The environment check/post-install routine, DVBA2714, will check for
 presence of the required patch, DVBA*2.7*15, and ensure that the Package
 File Patch Application History is up-to-date.  It appears that this patch
 went out without its proper link to the Package file.  This will rectify
 any inconsistencies.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
  will take less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*14):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*14.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
      DVBA 7131 INFORMATION REQUEST       Request for 7131 Information
      DVBA 7131 NON-ADMITTED VETS         Request for 7131 Information
                                          (Non- admitted Vets)
  
 7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
