Subject: PHARMACY REENGINEERING ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 2

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will 
 be used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
 writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.
  
 The ORDERABLE ITEM STATUS TRACKER field (#81) has been added as a returned
 data element for the PSS^PSS59P7 API on the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7).
  
 The ORIGINAL WARD field (#9) and the SCHEDULE field (#26) in the sub-file
 (#55.06) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) were added as returned data
 elements to the PSS432 component of the PSS55 API.
  
 The OTHER PRINT INFO field (#31) and the MED ROUTE field (#132) 
 in the sub-file (#55.01) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) 
 were added as returned data elements to the PSS435 & PSS436 
 components of the PSS55 API.
  
 The DIC and MIX APIs within the PSSDI routine have been modified to allow 
 drug selection with matches to certain VA Classes that are passed to the 
 call.
  
 Classes to be included or excluded are to be set up in the PSSVACL array
 within the DIC component.
  
 For example, if only drugs with a VA Class of DX201 & DX202 were to be
 available for selection, the local variable array would look like this:
  
 PSSVACL("DX201")=""
 PSSVACL("DX202")=""
 PSSVACL("R")="" - The "R" means only drugs with these classes will be
                   available for selection. If these classes were to be
                   excluded, the letter "P" would be used instead.
  
  
 A new API was added to routine PSS51P1. The PSSDQ component displays all 
 the entries in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1).

  3. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*108).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*108.
  
  5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"

     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
