Category:

Description: 
============

 Patch LBR*2.5*8 will replace the need for the VA Integration Team to
 RE-install patch LBR*2.5*3 to integrate Library databases.  After
 LBR*2.5*8 installation, Integration Team will be able to run the
 installation from the new assigned menu options.  Patch 8 is for use at
 multi-divisional sites.  For stations not integrating data, Patch 8
 installation should only take a short time.
  
 FOR ALL SITES. The following changes are made upon installation:
  
 1.  Changes are made to Input Templates [LBRYLTF] and [LBRYREC].
 2.  DATE/TIME CREATED Field (#33) of the LIBRARY TRANSACTIONS File
     (#682.1) is modified to allow the time of day to be entered.
 3.  Version numbers for Library files will be corrected to reflect there
     2.5 version number.
 4.  Two menus will be added to the Library Management menu [LBRY MANAGER],
     Prepare Library Data [LBRY INT PREPARE DATA] and Integrate Library
     Data [LBRY INT INTEGRATE DATA].  These menus are locked with the
     LBRYIRM Security key and for use by the Integration Team only during
     conversion of library data at integration.
 5.  Correct the version number of routine LBRYPRCS:
     Was:
     LBRYPRCS ;SSI/ALA-PROCESS LIBRARY TRANSACTIONS ;[ 04/17/98  1:04 PM ]
              ;;2.5;Library;**2,5**;Mar 11, 1996
     Now:
     LBRYPRCS  ;SSI/ALA-PROCESS LIBRARY TRANSACTIONS ;[ 04/17/98  1:04 PM ]
               ;;2.5;Library;**2**;Mar 11, 1996
  
 FOR SITES INTEGRATING.  There is a detailed Installation Guide/Release
 Notes manual on the Hines SOFTWARE.ANONYMOUS directory (address
 152.129.1.110) named LBR25_8.PDF and may be read using Acrobat reader. You
 may obtain it by ftp.  Please print the manual and keep the Installation
 Guide portion for the IRM staff and give the Release  Notes portion of the
 manual to the Chief, Library Service.  Integration Team members will
 utilize the two menu options installed with this patch during the library
 conversion of your integrating sites.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:  
 ==========================
     
 This patch may be installed with users on the system.  However, Library
 users should be off the system while the integration menus are being run
 by the Integration Team.
  
 Installation time for non-integrating sites should be less than 2 minutes.
  
 Installation time for integrating sites is directly affected by the number
 of integrating sites (if more than one) and the number of records in File
 #682.   
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE on the Packman menu. 
    
   2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed 
      from the mapped set at this time. 
    
   3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu, 
      select the Installation menu. 
    
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LBR*2.5*8): 
   
       a. Backup Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will 
          NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. 
   
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option 
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
          the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the 
          patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.). 
   
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are  
          in the transport global. 
    
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      LBR*2.5*8. 
   
   6. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO 
  
   7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//", answer "NO". 
    
   8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond NO. 
    
   9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be  
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
