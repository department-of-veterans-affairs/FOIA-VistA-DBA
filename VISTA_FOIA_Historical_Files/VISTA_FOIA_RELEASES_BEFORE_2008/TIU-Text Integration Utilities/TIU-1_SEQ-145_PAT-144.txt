Description: 
============

 I. DESCRIPTION:
    ============
 This patch aids sites in cleaning up old Consult documents with
 mismatched patients. After generating a list of mismatches, sites are 
 asked to resolve the mismatches manually.
  
 So far as we know, no NEW mismatches are being generated, so this clean 
 up task should not need to be redone once existing mismatches are dealt 
 with.
  
 The patch provides an option which generates a list of Consult documents
 with mismatched patients. The new option replaces a similar option
 provided in patch TIU*1*131. In some cases, the new option lists documents
 which were missed by the old option. The new option also provides 
 additional information on each mismatch.  The new option, in contrast to
 the old, does NOT include documents which are Progress Notes and not
 Consults.  When the option is run it sends a message with a summary of
 results to the local PATIENT SAFETY NOTIFICATIONS mailgroup.
  
 The list of mismatches includes any Consult document whose associated
 Consult Request is for a patient other than the patient of the document.
  
 After printing the list, sites should examine each document in the list
 and determine whether the document needs to be reassigned to a different
 patient, or re-linked to a different Consult Request. Sites should then
 proceed to reassign or re-link the document as appropriate.
  
 The patch also fixes several TIU VistA document management actions.

 Routine TIU131 is deleted at the site, upon installation of this patch.
  
 TIU DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT ACTION FIXES:
 =====================================
 1. If a TIU Consult document had a Requesting Package Reference (field
 1405) value beginning with -1 or 0, and if a user attempted to correct the
 problem using action "Link with Request", the action quit prematurely,
 failing to present the user with the list of Consult Requests to select
 from, or if the patient had no requests to select, failing to so inform
 the user.
  
 The action no longer quits prematurely.
  
 NOTE: Consult documents with a Requesting Package Reference value
 beginning with -1 or 0, do not involve patient mismatches, and have not
 been included in the mismatch list for this patch.  They will be dealt
 with in a future TIU patch.  Such documents probably involve patients who
 have no Consult Requests to select, and should therefore probably have
 their title changed to a Progress Note rather than being re-linked to a
 different result.  The action is fixed in this patch since it involves a
 routine already included in this patch.
  
 This problem was discovered by the developer, there are no known NOIS for 
 it.
  
 2. If a user used List Manager action "Change Title" for a document,
 changed the title from a Progress Note title to a Consult title, and,
 after changing the title, up-arrowed out instead of selecting a Consult
 Request to link the document to, the title remained changed instead of the
 change being rolled back.  The action now rolls back the title change.
 This problem is reported in NOIS TAM-1202-32252.
  
 3. If a user used List Manager action "Link with Request" to re-link a
 Consult document to a different Consult Request, and if the document had
 addenda, the addenda were not updated to reflect the new request.  So far
 as we know, this was not evident to the user in any VistA or CPRS GUI
 displays, but an inconsistency was created in the addendum entries in the
 TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925), where the request for the addendum failed to
 match the request for the original document.  Addenda are now updated
 appropriately in VistA when an original document is re-linked to a
 different request.  Even if the document is re-linked to the SAME request,
 the addenda are now updated with that request.  This means that re-linking
 an original document to the same request now provides a way of correcting
 addenda which were previously not linked to the same request as the
 original. 
  
 This problem was discovered by the developer, there are no known NOIS for 
 it.
  
  
 OPTIONS:
 ========
 Enhanced Mismatched Consults List
 [TIU144 ENHANCED MISMATCH LIST]
  
 This option replaces option "Consult Results with Mismatched Patients"
 [TIU131 LIST CONSULT MISMATCHES], which is deleted at the site upon
 installation of patch TIU*1*144.
  
 The option lists Consult documents which have mismatched patients. A
 document appears on the list if the patient for the REQUEST associated
 with the document does not match the patient for the DOCUMENT.
  
 This option should be run at all sites which have Consults in the TIU 
 DOCUMENT file (#8925). It should be queued to run at a non-peak time since
 it will take some time. For an electronic copy of the list, sites can 
 elect to print it to a spool device.
  
 NOTE: The report took 2 hours to run at a site with 9,600,000 documents in
 the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925). Your time may vary; time to run actually
 depends on the number of CONSULT documents the site has in the TIU
 DOCUMENT file.
  
 The option must be run from the programmer prompt:
  
   >D ^XUP
  
   Setting up programmer environment
   Terminal Type set to: C-VT220
  
  Select OPTION NAME: TIU144 ENHANCED MISMATCH LIST       Enhanced 
   Mismatched Consults List     action
   Enhanced Mismatched Consults List
  
 Searching for mismatched Consults could take some time.  Please
 remember to queue this option.

         10 mismatched documents found
  
  In listed mismatches, the patient for the request associated with the
 document does not match the patient for the document. See the description 
 for patch TIU*1*144 in the National Patch Module for further explanation
 of this display and for instructions on how to correct listed entries.

 III. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
      ==========================
  
   NOTE: This patch requires patch TIU*1*131 in order to ensure that all 
         known problems causing patient mismatches in Consults have been
         fixed BEFORE sites attempt to clean up old mismatches.
   NOTE: Installing this patch deletes old option "Consult Results with 
         Mismatched Patients", and its routine, TIU131, at the site where
         it is installed.
  
   Installation of this patch will take less than 2 minutes. Users need not
   be off the system when applying this patch.
  
   1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu, to 
        load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.  
  
   2.   From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
        select the Installation menu.  
  
   3.   From the installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
        options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*144): 
  
        a.  Backup a Transport Global
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
   4.   Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        TIU*1.0*144.
  
   5.   When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install? YES//', respond 'NO'.
  
   6.   When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//', respond 'NO'.
  
   7.   When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
        Options, and Protocols? YES//', respond 'NO'.
  
   8.   When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond '0'.
  
  
 IV. POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
     ===============================
  
   1.  After installing the patch, sites should run option, "Enhanced 
       Mismatched Consults List" [TIU144 ENHANCED MISMATCH LIST]. Sites 
       should then proceed to correct listed mismatches. See below for
       further information on correcting mismatches.
  
       The patch should be queued to run at a non-peak time, since it will
       take some time to run. Don't delete the option; you will want to 
       run it again later to confirm that all mismatches have been 
       corrected.  When the list comes up empty, indicating that no 
       mismatches remain after cleanup, you may delete the option if you
       wish.
  
  
 V. RESOLVING MISMATCHES:
    =====================
  
 Please begin this process by looking through the generated list of patient
 mismatches.  If any entries contain the line, "Consult # XXXX is ALSO
 linked to this document on the Consults side", you will need to do some
 special cleanup.  Please contact National Vista Support (NVS) for help
 before resolving those entries. See section VI. SPECIAL CLEANUP
 INSTRUCTIONS, at the end of the patch description.
  
 We recommend the following 6-step approach to resolving mismatches:
  
 1. Read through this entire patch description.
 2. Browse the entire list of mismatches.
 3. If a title needs to be changed for a document that also needs 
 re-linking, plan to change the title BEFORE re-linking.  This is more 
 efficient since the Change Title action itself brings up the re-link
 action.
 4. Don't worry about cleaning up addenda on the first printout of the 
 list.  Clean up original documents first.
 5. After resolving original documents, reprint the list and then deal 
 with any remaining original documents and remaining addenda.  In many 
 cases, cleaning up the original (parent) will automatically resolve
 addenda.
 6. When all mismatches have been resolved, reprint the list one last time.
 If all documents have indeed been resolved, this should generate a list 
 with the message: "No Mismatches found."  This will also serve to notify 
 the Patient Safety Notifications Mailgroup that all mismatches have been 
 resolved.
  
 The following comments describe documents expected to appear on the list
 and offer suggestions for dealing with them. These comments assume that
 the person correcting the mismatches is familiar with actions such as
 "Link with Request", "Reassign", and "Change Title". Test sites found 
 it helpful to have several sessions running concurrently during cleanup.
  
 Although this document deals with most situations a site is likely to 
 encounter, unforeseen situations may well arise. If sites experience
 difficulties or have questions on how to correct documents, they should
 request help from National VistA Support.
  
  
 Resolving Mismatches:
 =====================
  
 Three Software Errors:
 ----------------------
 Three separate software errors are known to have caused patient mismatches
 on Consult documents. Mismatches occurred under certain conditions:
   1) through the upload process when the dictated/transcribed Consult 
      Request number was incorrect.
   2) during direct entry (VistA) when using Consult Tracking to complete
      Consult Requests.
   3) when resulting consults from View Alerts. 
  
 There may be other software problems, unknown to us, which also generated
 patient mismatches on Consults. The known problems have been corrected,
 and, so far as we know, no NEW mismatches are occurring. (Exception: if 
 an addendum is made to a mismatched document, the mismatch is perpetuated 
 in the addendum.  This is not a software error, and must be dealt with by
 correcting the source of the problem, the mismatched original document.)
  
 The error which created mismatches when Consults were uploaded with 
 incorrect Consult Request numbers was fixed in patch TIU*1*131, which was 
 released on 7/25/02. Mismatches which occurred because of this error
 should be corrected by re-linking the document to the correct Consult
 Request. Such re-linking will remove them from the list of mismatches.
 Documents created via upload have Capture Method "U". See below for an
 example of re-linking a document to the correct request.
  
 The second software error occurred when a user completed a Consult in 
 VistA, using Consult Tracking, and switched back and forth between
 Appointment Management and Consult Tracking options.  A variable used to 
 identify the patient to TIU was not cleaned up between options, and
 as a result, although the Consult was completed for the correct patient,
 the new TIU document was sometimes created for a different patient.  
 Mismatches which occurred in this way should be corrected by reassigning
 the document to a different patient, the patient matching the associated
 request. Reassigning the document to the correct patient will remove the
 document from the list of mismatches. This error was fixed in patch
 OR*3*72, which was released on 2/25/00.  (A work-around was suggested
 earlier, in 11/99, in NOIS calls.) Documents created in VistA (as opposed
 to being uploaded or created in the CPRS GUI) have Capture Method "D". See
 below for an example of reassigning a document to the correct patient.
  
  
 The third error occurred when a user resulted consults from View Alerts, 
 and several Consults variables were not cleaned up. As in the second
 problem, above, the consult was completed for the correct patient, but the
 new TIU document was sometimes created for a different patient. This error
 was fixed in patch GMRC*3*4, which was released on 7/1/99.  These
 documents probably have Capture Method "D", and should be corrected as
 above, by reassigning the document to a different patient, the patient
 matching the associated request.
  
 Deleting Documents:
 -------------------
 A site may determine that certain documents should simply be deleted. If
 the "Delete" action is used to delete an UNSIGNED document, the document
 no longer exists and no longer appears on the list of mismatches. If a
 SIGNED document is deleted, the document is changed to status RETRACTED,
 and is hidden from view. Retracted documents do not appear on the list of
 mismatches.
  
 Changing the document to an "ERRONEOUS NOTE" title, or to a test patient
 does NOT remove the document from the list. Now that the "Delete"
 action maintains a hidden copy of the document, the "Delete" action should
 be used rather than moving the document to an "ERRONEOUS NOTE" title, or
 to a test patient.
  
 Addenda:
 --------
 Addenda, as well as original notes, may appear on the mismatch list. If
 so, they appear as separate items, not under their parent document. We
 suggest ignoring these addenda until after all original documents have
 been corrected. Then reprint the mismatch list and deal with remaining
 addenda.  Most addenda will have been corrected automatically when the
 parent was corrected, and will no longer appear on the list.
  
 Mismatched addenda were created when an addendum was made to a document
 with a mismatched patient: the addendum evidences the same mismatch as the
 original.  There may be other circumstances as well which created 
 mismatched addenda.
  
 If the site determines that an addendum still applies and should remain
 attached to the same, original document, then re-linking the parent will
 automatically also re-link the addendum, or reassigning the parent will
 automatically also reassign the addendum.  Either action will remove both
 original and addendum from the mismatch list.
  
 As an alternative, if the addendum no longer applies, the site may choose
 to delete it. Deleting the addendum will remove it from the mismatch list.
 If a document which should be reassigned to a different patient has an
 UNSIGNED addendum which should be deleted, the addendum should be deleted
 before the document is reassigned.  However, if a document which should be
 reassigned to a different patient has a COMPLETED addendum which should be
 deleted, it is best to reassign the document first, and then delete the
 unsigned addendum which is copied to the new patient.  Deleting a
 completed addendum BEFORE reassigning a document will necessitate an
 additional deletion: if a document with a retracted addendum is
 reassigned, the retracted addendum is still copied to the new patient, and
 will need to be deleted again, for the new patient.
  
 If, on the other hand, the site determines that the addendum still
 applies, but should be moved to a different document, then the 
 addendum should be reassigned, using action "Move", under action 
 "Reassign".  The "Move" action does not update the addendum's Consult
 Request, and it may be necessary to re-link the new parent document in
 order to update the request for the newly moved addendum.
  
 Changing Consults to Progress Notes:
 ------------------------------------
 The site may decide that certain documents should be changed from Consults
 to Progress Notes.  The "Change Title" action is available for such
 changes and SHOULD clean-up Consults links when a Consult is changed to
 a Progress Note. Unfortunately, the "Change Title" action FAILS TO REMOVE
 THE LINK in the TIU DOCUMENT FILE (#8925). This is a known TIU problem and
 will be fixed. (Action "Change Title" DOES remove the link in the
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION FILE (#123), as it should.)
  
 Until this is fixed, changing the title of a Consult to a Progress Note
 does not entirely clean up a patient mismatch.  Changing the title to a 
 Progress Note does, however, ensure that the erroneous link in the TIU
 DOCUMENT FILE is not invoked: TIU VistA screen action "Print" for the
 given document will not display Standard Form 513 for the wrong Consult
 Request on a different patient.  Instead, screen action "Print" will print
 the document just like any other Progress Note.  Since the list of 
 mismatches contains only Consult documents, changing the title of a 
 Consult to a Progress Note DOES remove the document from the mismatch 
 list.
  
 TIU plans to provide an option to clean up Consult links in file 8925 on
 Progress Note documents at some point in the future.  That option will
 then clean up these remaining elements of the mismatch.
  
 Other:
 ------
 There may be documents on the list which do not fit any of these
 descriptions. In such cases, the site will need to use its judgment in 
 deciding how to correct them; we cannot make a recommendation. Questions
 should be addressed to National VistA Support. 
  
 Confirming Corrections:
 -----------------------
 Sites should re-run option "Enhanced Mismatched Consults List" after
 making corrections, to confirm that mismatches have been corrected.
 Documents which have been corrected by re-linking, reassigning, deletion,
 or changing title to a Progress Note will no longer appear on the list.
 Sites should not delete option "Enhanced Mismatched Consults List", along
 with its routine TIU144, until all the documents on the list have been
 cleaned up, and the list contains no mismatches.
  
 Examples of Resolving Mismatches:
 =================================
  
 In this section we take several documents from a simulated mismatch list
 and show how to correct the documents.
  
 NOTE: Capture Method is abbreviated as follows: 
   'D' for direct (i.e. VistA),
   'C' for converted (from an older package), 
   'R' for remote procedure (i.e. CPRS GUI),
   'O' for copy (TIU List Manager options have an action to copy a note 
       to a different patient),
   'U' for upload.
  
 Example 1: Linking a Document to a Different Consult Request:
 =============================================================
  
   5.   Note Title: MEDICINE CS CONSULT               #: 5138      Capt: U
   Pt: CONTFORT,A  (C1432)                            Rf Date: 01/11/99
   Cnslt To Serv: CARDIOLOGY                          Cnslt #: 1272
   Pt: BUCHALTER,W  (B8833)                           Date: 12/22/98
  
 This is the fifth document in the mismatch list.  It is a Consult 
 document entitled MEDICINE CS CONSULT, with internal file number 5138, 
 written on patient CONTFORT, with Reference Date 01/11/99.  This document 
 was created by the upload process (Capture Method is U.) It is linked in
 the TIU DOCUMENT FILE with Consult Request #1272.
  
 Consult Request #1272 is for patient BUCHALTER, with To Service 
 CARDIOLOGY.  The request is dated 12/22/98.
  
 The patient for the TIU document doesn't match the patient for the 
 Consult Request, so the document needs correction.  All corrections 
 involving TIU documents must be done from the TIU side, using VistA 
 actions intended for such corrections.
  
 Since this document was created via upload, it was probably 
 dictated/transcribed with the wrong Consult Request number. The note 
 pre-dates patch TIU*1*131 (released on 7/25/02), which smartened up the 
 upload code to prevent patient mismatches, so the date of the note is 
 consistent with this explanation. If this explanation is correct, the 
 document should be re-linked to a different Consult Request. 
  
 To make the correction, we use the TIU Manager Menu and locate the 
 document:

 NOTE: If the appropriate request to link a document to has been 
 discontinued or cancelled, that request will not appear among the choices,
 above.  In such a case, the site may wish to use FileMan to edit the 
 status of the request back to pending.  This will ensure that the request 
 appears on the list.  For help, contact NVS.
  
 NOTE: In some cases, there may be no appropriate request at all to link a 
 document to.  In that case, the site may wish to change the title of the 
 note to a Progress Notes title.  See section "Changing Consults to
 Progress Notes," above.
  
 When the document has been re-linked, action "Print" will display Standard
 Form 513 for Consult Request #1273, enabling me to verify that the
 document has been linked to the new request.  After refreshing patient
 data, the Consults Tab for patient CONTFORT in the CPRS GUI will also
 display the new information for Consult Request #1273.
  
 It is important to examine the old Consult Request #1272, as well, and to
 verify that it has been properly cleaned up on the Consults side. In this
 case, the Consults Tab for patient BUCHALTER in the CPRS GUI for Consult
 Request #1272 will show that TIU document 5138 has been dissociated from
 the request.  Please also check the STATUS of the request; in some cases a
 request may be erroneously reactivated when a document is dissociated.
  
 In particular, if a note is linked to a Consult Request with status
 "Discontinued," and the note is re-linked to a different request, the
 Discontinued request may become "Active" when the note is dissociated.  
 This may also happen for documents completed administratively.  If this
 occurs, please discontinue (or complete) the request again. This should be
 done promptly after the re-linking so that the request does not remain
 erroneously active any longer than necessary.
  
  
 Example 2: Reassigning a Document to a Different Patient:
 =========================================================
  
   3.   Note Title: PULMONARY CS CONSUL              #: 25413     Capt: D
   Pt: BABBITT,T  (B8832)                          Rf Date: 12/22/98
   Cnslt To Serv: PULMONOLOGY                        Cnslt #: 1570
   Pt: NIVEK,A (N8796)                               Date: 12/03/98
  
 This is the third document in the mismatch list.  It is a Consult 
 document entitled PULMONARY CS CONSULT, with internal file number 25413, 
 written on patient BABBITT, with Reference Date 12/22/98.  This document 
 was created in VistA (Capture Method is D for Direct). It is linked in the
 TIU DOCUMENT FILE with Consult Request #1570.
  
 Consult Request #1570 is for patient NIVEK, with To Service PULMONOLOGY.  
 The request is dated 12/03/98.
  
 The patient for the TIU document doesn't match the patient for the Consult
 Request, so the document needs correction.  All corrections involving TIU
 Consult documents must be done from the TIU side, using VistA actions
 intended for such corrections.
  
 Since this document was created directly in VistA, it may have been 
 created for the wrong patient when a user completed a consult using 
 Consult Tracking and switching back and forth between Appointment 
 Management and Consult Tracking options. That error was fixed in patch 
 OR*3*72 which was released on 2/25/00, so the date of the note is 
 consistent with this explanation. Alternately, it may have been 
 created for the wrong patient when a user completed a consult from View 
 Alerts.  These errors were fixed in patch OR*3*72 (released on 2/25/00),
 and in patch GMRC*3*4 (released on 7/1/99), so the date of the note is
 consistent with either explanation. In either case, the document should be
 reassigned to a different patient, the patient associated with Consult
 Request #1570. 
  
 To make the correction, we use the TIU Manager Menu option, as above, and
 locate the document:

 If the Consult document contains clinical data, and the encounter data for
 Babbit's original Cardiology visit contains data obviously intended for
 Nivek's Pulmonology visit, it should be cleaned up, if possible. If, on
 the other hand, the Consult Result does not contain clinical data but
 concerns appointment management only, then it is not appropriate to clean
 up the encounter data for the original visit.  Here again, questions may
 be addressed to National VistA Support.

 Example 3: Mismatched Addenda:
 ==============================
 An addendum entry in the mismatch list might look like:
  
   8.   Note Title: Addendum                         #: 25517     Capt: D
   Pt: BABBITT,T  (B8832)                          Rf Date: 12/24/98
   Cnslt To Serv: PULMONOLOGY                        Cnslt #: 1570
   Pt: NIVEK,A (N8796)                               Date: 12/03/98
   Parent Title: PULMONARY CS CONSULT                      #: 25413
   Rf Date: 12/22/98
  
 This is an addendum to the note from Example 2.  See section Addenda,
 under section Resolving Mismatches, above. If the site determines that the
 addendum still applies and should remain attached to the same, original
 document, then re-linking the parent will automatically also re-link the
 addendum, or reassigning the parent will automatically also reassign the
 addendum. For this reason, we suggest ignoring addenda until after all
 original documents have been corrected.
  
  
 VI. SPECIAL CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS:
     =============================
  
 Some sites have attempted to correct patient mismatches using Fileman
 instead of using TIU document management options.  This has sometimes
 resulted in documents being linked on the Consults side to the correct
 request, while remaining linked on the TIU side to an incorrect request,
 and possibly remaining linked on the Consults side to an incorrect request
 AS WELL AS to the correct request.
  
 If TIU document management options are used to correct such documents, the
 Last Action on the Consult Request the document is re-linked to may 
 incorrectly indicate that an addendum was added to the document when in 
 fact the last action was a complete/update action or some other action:
  
 Status:                COMPLETE
 Last Action:           ADDENDUM ADDED TO
  
 (This is not a software error; it results from the inconsistency created
 when Consult links were changed, using FileMan, but TIU links were NOT
 changed.) This incorrect Last Action is undesirable.
  
 Entries on the mismatch list which may generate this undesirable Last 
 Action when re-linked are marked in the mismatch list by the presence of 
 an additional line of the form, "Consult # XXXX is ALSO linked to this
 document on the Consults side."
  
 If your mismatch list includes entries containing such a line, please 
 contact NVS for help in correcting them.
