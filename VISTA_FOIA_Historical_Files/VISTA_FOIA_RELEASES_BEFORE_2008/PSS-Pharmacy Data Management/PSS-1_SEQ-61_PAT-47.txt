Description: 
============

 This patch provides new functionality that allows the Veteran Affairs
 Medical Centers to print a patient's prescription bottle label in another
 language.  This functionality is accomplished by identifying which
 patients have another language preference. To identify patients 
 as having another language preference use Update Patient Record [PSO PAT]
 option and Patient Record Update [PSO PATIENT RECORD UPDATE] protocol action
 and enter Yes in the new field OTHER LANGUAGE PREFERENCE field (#106) in the
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
  
 The other language translations are entered by using Other Language
 Translation Setup [PSS OTHER LANGUAGE SETUP] option. This new
 option is not linked to any menu, but must be assigned to the person(s)
 responsible for maintaining this functionality.
  
 The following options must be used to enter the remaining language
 translations data:
  DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
  DOSAGES ...[PSS DOSAGES MANAGEMENT]
      DOSAGE FORM FILE ENTER/EDIT [PSS DOSAGE FORM EDIT]

 Installation Instructions:                                         
 ==========================
 Do not install this patch when Outpatient orders are being entered and
 signed through COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORD SYSTEMS (CPRS) V1.0.
 Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours for CPRS.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.

    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*47):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*47.
