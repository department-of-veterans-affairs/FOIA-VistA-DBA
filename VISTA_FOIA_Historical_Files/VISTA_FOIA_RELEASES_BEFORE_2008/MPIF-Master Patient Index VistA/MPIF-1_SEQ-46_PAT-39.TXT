Subject: LOCAL/MISSING ICN JOB CHANGE FOR LOCALS NOT RESOLVED

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*41 and MPIF*1.0*43 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*39.
   
  Issue #1:
  If a local ICN is not resolved during the processing of the LOCAL/
  MISSING ICN RESOLUTION [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES] background job, (due
  to a system problem either on the Master Patient Index (MPI) or at
  the site sending the message), the local ICN would never be sent to
  the MPI again under the current business rules.  The existing business 
  rule to only send a patient with a local ICN to the MPI once has been
  modified.  If the local ICN was sent to the MPI more than two days ago,
  and has not been assigned a National ICN, the local ICN will be sent to
  the MPI again to attempt to resolve ICN.  Routine MPIFRES has been
  modified to support this change.
   
  Issue #2:
  Currently, an ADT-A31 Patient Update Health Level Seven message is
  triggered when a patient receives an Integration Control Number (ICN)
  or if the ICN is changed.  Unexpected results are occurring on the
  MPI when the ICN is changed from one value to another.  Because
  demographic updates are sent to the MPI by other existing processes,
  the ADT-A31 message will no longer be triggered for an ICN change. 
  That will prevent the unexpected results from occurring on the MPI.
  Routine MPIFA24 has been modified to support this change.

  FYI - if you run ^XINDEX on routine MPIFA24, a reference to OMGPIDMI
  is displayed as a routine that is not available on your system and
  that is correct.  This relates only to the Federal Health Information
  Exchange (FHIE) Framework system.  This reference was introduced in an
  earlier patch - MPIF*1.0*25.
