Description:
============

  ****************************** A L E R T   ******************************
   This patch involves a conversion of provider fields #10, #15 and #17 of 
   the Event Capture File #721 to a multiple field #42 in the same file.
   The EC application will be unavailable during the conversion.
  
   Please install during non-peak hours. 
  *************************************************************************
  
   
 The following changes were identified by Bedford Decision Support Office (DSO)
 for addition to the Event Capture product for FY06.
  
 1) Add Multiple Dates/Multiple Procedures Data Entry option to Event Capture 
    System (ECS) Graphical User Interface (GUI).
  
  
 a. Technical
    o  Create a new form called UfrmMultiple1 with multiple tabs.
    o  Modified existing routine and form UfrmDataEntryMenu to add new 
       multiple option.
    o  Delphi routine UfrmECMain was changed to update the client version
       from 2.0.11.0 to 2.1.0.0.
    o  Menu option EC GUI Context version 2.0.11.0 was changed to update 
       the server version to 2.1.0.0.
  
 b. Functional
    o  The new menu option will be selectable from the Data Entry Option 
       Menu.
    o  User can enter multiple procedure for multiple patients by selecting 
       the 'Providers', 'Procedures', and 'Patients' tabs.
    o  Users have the ability to remove/edit procedures, providers, and
       patients.
  
 2) Add two new reports to the ECS Management Menu which will list ECS products 
    with out-of-date Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.  These reports 
    will be called:
      - Event Code Screens with CPT Codes Report.
      - National/Local Procedure Codes with Inactive CPT Codes.
  
 a. Technical
    o  New routines ECSCPT and ECSCPT1 were created to generate the "Event
       Code Screens with CPT Codes Report".
    o  A new routine ECINCPT was created to generate the "National/Local 
       "Procedure Codes with Inactive CPT Codes."
    o  A new option ECSCPT was created for the "Event Code Screens with CPT 
       Codes Report".
    o  A new option ECINCPT was created for the "National/Local Procedure Codes 
       with Inactive CPT Codes."
    o  Help frames ECSCPT and ECINCPT were created.
    o  Routines ECRRPC and ECRRPT1 were modified to handle the two (2) new 
       reports from the ECS GUI interface.  These routines govern the remote 
       procedure call (RPC), EC REPORTS.
    o  Delphi routine and form UfrmSelectReport was modified to add the two 
       new reports.
  
 b. Functional
    o  The new menu options will be selectable from the Management Report Menu.
    o  Users must have the ECMGR key to access these reports.
    o  Event Code Screens with CPT Codes Report
         This option allows the user to print/display event code screens
         with active/inactive/both CPT codes for all or a specific DSS
         Unit. The output includes
           - Run Date
           - Location
           - Service
           - DSS Unit
           - Category (if applicable)
           - Procedure Name
           - National Number
           - CPT Code
            (CPT inactive codes are flagged with an *I* when printing
             both active and inactive codes)
    o  National/Local Procedure Codes with Inactive CPT Codes
         This report provides a list of National and Local Procedure Codes with
         inactive CPT codes from EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file. The output
         includes
           - Run Date
           - National Number
           - National Name
           - CPT Code
           - Inactive Date
   
 3) Allow an unlimited number of providers in ECS Data Entry along with the 
    ability of sending them to Patient Care Encounter (PCE). Also allow for 
    the display of up to 7 providers on the Provider Summary report.
    
 a. Technical
    o  A new provider utility/API routine ECPRVMUT was created to prompt for 
       providers, display providers and file providers.
    o  Routine ECPRSUM1 was modified to display 7 providers instead of 3.
    o  The following routines were modified to use the new provider APIs: 
       ECED1, ECED3, ECEDF, ECBEN1A, ECBEN1B, ECBEN2A, ECBEN2U, ECBENF, 
       ECBEP1A, ECBEP1B, ECBEP2A, ECBEP2B, ECBEPF, ECMLMF, ECMLMD, ECMUTL, 
       ECPAT, ECPROV3, ECOSSUM, ECPRSUM1, ECPCER, ECRPRSN, ECNTPCE, ECUERPC, 
       ECUERPC1, ECUERPC2 and ECV3RPC.
    o  Templates "EC CREATE PATIENT ENTRY" and "EC FILE PCE NODE" were modified 
       to remove reference to old provider variables.
    o  A new multiple "PROVIDER MULTIPLE" (#42) field was added to EVENT 
       CAPTURE PATIENT (#721) file.
    o  Provider fields "PROVIDER" (#10), "PROVIDER #2" (#15) and "PROVIDER #3" 
       (#17) were flagged for inactivation and will no longer be used after 
       the installation of this patch.
    o  "PCE DATA FEED" (#30) field documentation was updated to remove reference
       to old provider fields.
    o  Help frame "EC PRO SUM" was modified to reflect 7 providers instead of 3.
    o  Option "EC PRO SUM" was modified to reflect 7 providers instead of 3.
    o  DBIA1873 was modified to remove reference to provider fields "PROVIDER" 
       (#10), "PROVIDER #2" (#15) and "PROVIDER #3" (#17).
    o  DBIA4460 was created to prompt/file/display an encounter's providers.
    o  Post install routine EC2P72PT was created to perform the conversion of 
       the provider fields.  The data stored in fields "PROVIDER" (#10), 
       "PROVIDER #2" (#15) and "PROVIDER #3" (#17) will be moved to the 
       "PROVIDER MULTIPLE" (#42) field.  This job will run in the background.
    o  DSS companion patch ECX*3.0*89 was created to call API $$GETPRV^ECPRVMUT
       to get the provider instead of reading directly from fields "PROVIDER" 
       (#10), "PROVIDER #2" (#15) and "PROVIDER #3" (#17).
    o  DELPHI routines and forms for UfrmEditPatientProc and 
       UfrmEditProcPatients2 were changed to allow unlimited number of providers
       during entry.  Delphi form UfrmSelectReport was modified to reflect 7 
       providers instead of 3.
    o  Delphi routine UDataEntryUtilities.pas was changed to allowing for filing 
       an unlimited number of providers.
    o  Delphi spreadsheet routine Mainspread.pas was changed to allow for filing
       provider using the new data structure.
    
 b. Functional
    o  Routine ECPRVMUT provides the following APIs.
       $$GETPRV(ECIEN,OUTARR)   - returns the providers associated with an 
                                  encounter.
       $$GETPPRV(ECIEN,ECPPROV) - returns the primary provider associated 
                                  with an encounter.
       $$FILPRV(ECIEN,ECPRVARY, - files multiple providers for an encounter.
                ECOUT)
       $$ASKPRV(ECIEN,ECDT,     - prompt and validate providers (primary and
                ECPRVARY,ECOUT)   multiple secondary).
       $$COMP(ECUX,ECDTX)       - gets provider class information.
      
     o The following options were affected by the provider changes.
        ECS Roll-n-Scroll
        -----------------
        Event Capture Data Entry ... 
          Enter/Edit Patient Procedures
          Batch Enter Data by Patient
          Data Entry (Batch) by Procedure
          Multiple Dates/Multiple Procedures Data Entry
        Event Capture Reports ...
          Patient Summary - Event Capture
          Provider Summary Report
          Ordering Section Summary Report
          Provider (1-7) Summary Report
          PCE Data Summary
          Procedure Reason Report
          Records Failing Transmission to PCE Report
   
        ECS GUI
        -------
        Data Entry ...
          Enter/Edit Patient Procedure(s)
          Batch (Same Procedure, Multiple Patients)
        Spreadsheet
        Reports ...
          (same reports as roll-n-scroll)
    o The conversion of the providers will be done in the background.  During 
      this process users will not be able to access Event Capture.  When the 
      process is completed a mail message will be generated and sent to the 
      patch installer with information on the conversion.  
  
      If the process is halted for any reason.  Then a mail message will be 
      sent to the installer indicating the number of records that have been 
      converted and how to restart the process from the last record. 
    o When a duplicate record is uploaded, the provider along with other data
      is displayed to the user to indicate a duplicate record.  Users will 
      continue to see only 3 providers even if the encounter has more than 3
      providers.
    
 4) Add EC National Procedure Code to EC Reports.
  
 a. Technical
    o  The following routines were modified to add the national procedure code 
       to the reports: - ECPAT, ECOSSUM, ECRDSSU, ECPROV3, ECPRSUM1, ECPCER,
       ECRPRSN, and ECNTPCE.
  
 b. Functional
    o  Users will see the 5 character EC national number associated with a 
       procedure now being displayed on the following reports in the 
       roll-n-scroll and GUI applications.
       Event Capture Reports ...
          Patient Summary - Event Capture
          DSS Unit Workload Summary
          Provider Summary Report
          Ordering Section Summary Report
          Provider (1-7) Summary Report
          PCE Data Summary
          Procedure Reason Report
          Records Failing Transmission to PCE Report
     
 5) Add a column titled "Status" to reflect inactive or active status of Event 
    Code Screens for ECS GUI only.
  
 a. Technical
    o  DELPHI routine and form UfrmECMgmtmenu was modified to add the status 
       column to the grid.
  
 b. Functional
    o  Users will see an additional column called "Status" when they select
       the 'Event Code Screen' button from the GUI Management Menu.  The value 
       will be 'Active' or 'Inactive'
  
  
 6) Update the ECS GUI to include a time out feature consistent with Computerized
    Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
 a. Technical
    o  DELPHI routine and form UfrmECMain was modified to add a 300 second time 
       out.
  
 b. Functional
    o  If the EC GUI application is left unattended for 300 seconds then it will
       timeout.
  
  
 7) Use LEX API to perform lookup diagnosis instead of using file ICD DIAGNOSIS
    (#80) file.
    
 a. Technical
    o  Routine ECUTL2 was changed to use LEX api, CONFIG^LEXSET, and Fileman
       lookup using EXPRESSIONS (#757.01) file instead of Fileman lookup on 
       ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file.
    o  Routine ECEDU was changed to use call PDX^ECUTL2 which points to LEX 
       files instead of interacting with ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file through 
       Fileman.
    o  Routines ECUMRCP1 and ECUMRPC2 were modified to add code to RPC, 
       EC GETLIST, to return a list of ICD code from LEX API.  A new line tag
       LEX was added to routine ECUMRPC2 to return a list of ICD code matches
       base on a search string.
    o  DELPHI routines UfrmEditPatientProc and UfrmEditProcPatients2 were 
       modified to use RPC, EC GETLIST, to retrieve ICD9 codes from Lex 
       database instead of ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file.
    o  The following supported DataBase Integration Agreements (DBIAs) were 
       used:-
       * DBIA1577  - CONFIG^LEXSET in routines ECUTL2 AND ECUMRPC2.
       * DBIA2950  - LOOK^LEXA in routine ECUMRPC2.
       * DBIA1573  - $$ICDONE^LEXU in routine ECUMRPC2.
  
 b. Functional
    o  All data entry options under the roll-n-scroll application were affected
       by this changed. Also all data entry options under the GUI application.
