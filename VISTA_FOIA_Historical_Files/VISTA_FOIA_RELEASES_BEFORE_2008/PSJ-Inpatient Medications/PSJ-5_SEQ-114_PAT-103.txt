Subject:  IDENTIFY NON-STANDARD / DANGEROUS SCHEDULES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Modifications are being made to Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 to no 
 longer allow non-standard schedules to be used. This patch provides a 
 menu option to allow users to identify non-standard schedules
 that are currently in use. This option will search through Order Sets,
 Quick Codes, the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), the PHARMACY 
 ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) and all orders for the timeframe specified by
 the user. The person running the option will receive a series of email
 messages identifying the non-standard schedules. The email message
 subjects will be: ADMIN SCHEDULES, ADMIN SCHEDULES NOT IN 51.1,
 NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES IN QUICK CODES, NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES IN ORDER
 SETS and NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES IN ORDERABLE ITEMS. The search routine can
 be run multiple times. This can be used to help show the progress being
 made in correcting issues. In addition, the report will show active orders
 in the search period. Please note: the default schedules in the PHARMACY 
 ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) are for both inpatient and outpatient orders. 
  
 2. Based on the upcoming requirement from the Joint Commission on 
 Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, schedule names that are
 considered dangerous will no longer be allowed. This patch provides a 
 menu option to allow users to identify schedules that are considered 
 dangerous. This option will search through Order Sets, Quick Codes, the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file 
 (50.7) and all orders for the timeframe specified by the user. The person
 running the option will receive a series of email messages identifying the
 dangerous schedules. The email message subjects will be: DANGEROUS
 SCHEDULES IN 51.1, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN ORDERS, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN
 QUICK CODES, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN ORDER SETS and DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN 
 ORDERABLE ITEMS. Note: the JCAHO web site has information on schedules 
 that are considered dangerous: www.jcaho.org - National Patient Safety 
 Goals and FAQs.
  
 3. To facilitate the iterative process of running the search and report 
 multiple times, two new options are being added to the system. They are 
 the Non-Standard Schedule Search [PSJU NSS SEARCH] option and the
 Non-Standard Schedule Report [PSJU NSS REPORT] option.
  
 ***IMPORTANT NOTE*** For purposes of this patch, non-standard schedules 
 are defined as those that are not in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file 
 (#51.1). There are three exceptions: Day-of-Week, PRN and admin-time only 
 schedules are not reported. Only Pharmacy files were searched for these 
 email messages and reports.
