Subject: AUTHOR DISPLAY AND DUPLICATE OUTPUTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address 2 problems:
  
 First, if an TIU Note Author's name is longer than 20 characters,it will
 run into and be truncated by the EXP COSIGNER field when viewing the
 document in the List Manager TIU BROWSE options and in the CPRS Notes tab.
  
 Secondly, under many options that search for TIU documents, a document
 with an addendum will be displayed twice if the parent and child notes
 are both within the selected date range.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 Problem 1:
 ---------
  
 If a TIU Note's Author has a name longer than 20 characters then it will 
 run into and be truncated by the EXP COSIGNER field when being displayed 
 in List Manager or in the CPRS Notes tab.
  
 Resolution 1:
 ------------
  
 Properly truncate the Author's name so that there is always at least 2
 spaces between their name and the EXP COSIGNER field.
  
 Problem 2:
 ---------
  
 Under many options that search for TIU documents, a document with an
 addendum will be displayed twice if the parent and child notes are both
 within the selected date range. If the note the search routine is 
 evaluating is a child then the search routine will replace it with the
 parent so that the whole record is displayed - even if the parent note is
 prior to the selected date range.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ------------
 If the note being evaluated is a child then replace it with the parent 
 note only if the parent note was not already selected by the search 
 criteria.
