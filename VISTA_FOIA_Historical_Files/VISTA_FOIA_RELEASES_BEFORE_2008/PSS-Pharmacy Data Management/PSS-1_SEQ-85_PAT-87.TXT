Description:
============

 As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
 a new commercial data source will be utilized to provide warning label
 information. 
  
 This patch is required by PSO*7*161 which does the printing of the 
 warning labels on the laser labels form.
  
 The following changes are included in this patch:
  
 Data dictionary changes:
 ===========================
 New fields:
 1. PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7), WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16)
 The new warning label processing is not fully functional until this field
 is set to "N" for "New" in the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS 
 EDIT] option.
 2. DRUG file (#50), NEW WARNING LABEL LIST field (#8.1)
 If the default warnings for a drug are not sufficient, a custom list of 
 warning numbers can be created and stored in this field.
 3. DRUG file (#50), GENDER SPECIFIC LBLS ON ALL RX field (#8.2)
 If the commercial data source has indicated that a particular warning 
 only applies to one gender, then if this flag is null or "Y", the warning 
 will print for all patients. If this field is "N", the warning will only
 print for this drug when the patient is that specific gender.
 4. RX CONSULT file (#54), WARNING MAPPING field (#2)
 5. RX CONSULT file (#54), SPANISH TRANSLATION field (#3)
  
 The last 2 fields in the above list will have some entries populated
 automatically in a post-install routine with this patch. The mapping is
 used for matching entries in the old RX CONSULT file (#54) with the
 equivalent entry in the new WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH file (#50.625).
  
 New options under the PSS Manager [PSS MGR] option:
 ==================================================
 1. Warning Builder [PSS WARNING BUILDER] option allows the user to print a
 copy of the old and new warning file entries and to choose various ways to
 select drugs to review which warnings will print when the flag is turned
 to use the new warning label source. It also allows the user to override
 the default warning labels to create a custom warning label list for the
 selected drug. This is done by specifying a list of warning numbers from
 the old RX CONSULT file (#54) and/or the new commercial data source
 warning file.
 2. Warning Mapping [PSS WARNING MAPPING] option can be used to match an
 entry from the old RX CONSULT file (#54) to the WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH 
 file (#50.625) to aid in using the Warning Builder (to identify local
 warnings that do not have an equivalent entry in the new commercial data
 source). The user can also enter a Spanish translation for an RX CONSULT
 file (#54) entry, if desired, but whenever possible, the new commercial
 data source's warnings should be used.
  
 Template changes:
 =================
 This patch modifies the DRUG file (#50) INPUT template [PSSCOMMON] to 
 allow the user to view the new warning labels for a drug and edit the NEW 
 WARNING LABEL LIST field (#8.1), if desired. For drugs that have a 
 gender-specific warning associated with them, the new GENDER SPECIFIC 
 LBLS ON ALL RX field (#8.2) will also be prompted.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  
  The revised User and Technical Manuals are available on the
  ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of
  Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the 
      first available FTP server.
   
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
  
       Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
       Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
       Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

  take less than 1 minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
