Subject: GMPL*2*31 INFORMATIONAL FOLLOW_UP

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Included in patch GMPL*2*31 was a clean up routine GMPL31P. This routine 
 searched out bad ICD9 (file 81) pointers in the PROBLEM LIST file and 
 PROBLEM LIST AUDIT entries. For pointers that included the "~", the "~" 
 was removed and the remaining value was left. If a "-1" was found the 
 pointer to the default ICD9 code 799.99 was put in the place of the "-1".

 PROBLEM:
 =========
 The concern is the CLINICAL REMINDERS Index which contains the same ICD9 
 pointer from the PROBLEM LIST. If a pointer was bad in the PROBLEM LIST 
 this index may not exist or may have the same bad pointer.
 Following is the Fileman description of the index shown in the .01 field 
 of the PROBLEM LIST file description.
  
 RECORD INDEX:     ACR (#506)    MUMPS    IR    ACTION
                   Short Descr:  Clinical Reminders index for ICD9 lookup.
                   Description:  This cross-reference builds two indexes, 
                                 one for finding all patients with 
                                 a particular ICD9 code and one for 
                                 finding all the ICD9 codes a patient has.
                                 The indexes are stored in the
                                 Clinical Reminders index global as: 
                                 
 ^PXRMINDX(9000011,"ISPP",ICD9,STATUS,PRIORITY,DFN,DLM,DAS)
                                 
 ^PXRMINDX(9000011,"PSPI",DFN,STATUS,PRIORITY,ICD9,DLM,DAS)
                                 respectively.  
                                  
                                 STATUS can be "A" for active or "I" for
                                 inactive.  PRIORITY can be "A" for acute
                                 or "C" for chronic. If PRIORITY is missing
                                 then a "U" will be stored in the index.  
                                 For Problems whose PRIORITY is "C"
                                 Clinical Reminders uses today's date for
                                 the date of the Problem. In all other
                                 cases Clinical Reminders uses DLM where
                                 DLM is the date last modified.  When
                                 Problems are "removed" then CONDITION is 
                                 set to "H" for hidden. Hidden Problems are
                                 not indexed.  For all the details, see the
                                 Clinical Reminders Index Technical
                                 Guide/Programmer's Manual.
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 If  the routine GMPL31P found bad pointers; it is suggested that the 
 OPTION PXRM INDEX MANAGEMENT /  IB  Clinical Reminders Index Build, 
 function be used to re-index the PROBLEM LIST index only.
 It is also suggested that the function of re-building the index be done
 in off hours. 
 Listed below is included an example of the Clinical Reminders Index build
 option for the Problem List index and a re-posting of the clean-up
 instructions which are alredy documented in GMPL*2*31.

 CLEAN UP INSTRUCTIONS FROM GMPL*2*31:
 ======================================
     A clean up post routine GMPL31P is included. It will loop through the
     Problem list looking for ICD-9 pointers which contain a "~" or "-1".
     In the case "~' it will be removed. In the case of a "-1", it will be
     updated to point to the ICD-9 799.99. The routine writes to the screen
     what was found and modified. Following is an example of the output:
