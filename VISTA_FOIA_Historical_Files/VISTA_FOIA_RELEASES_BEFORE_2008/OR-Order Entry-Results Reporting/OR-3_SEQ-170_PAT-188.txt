 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
 
 This patch re-establishes the use of the standard Patient Inquiry for display
 in CPRS.  CPRS was displaying Race and Ethnicity information using code in
 CPRS routines.  The Patient Inquiry display was recently modified to reflect
 the patient's Race and Ethnicity information and the required HIPAA Opt-Out
 information and now will be used by CPRS.  The following NOIS are associated
 with this patch:
