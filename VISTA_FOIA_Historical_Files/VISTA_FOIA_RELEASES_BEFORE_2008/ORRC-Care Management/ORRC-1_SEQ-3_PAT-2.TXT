Description:
============

 This patch introduces several modifications to the Care Management 
 application. 
  
 With this patch, Care Management will display Patient Record Flags 
 (PRFs)-if they exist-when users access patient data. 
  
 Specifically, Care Management will display PRFs when:
 1) Users access headlights or patient demographics via the Clinician 
    or Nurse Dashboard. 
 2) Users display the details associated with the results of queries 
    that include patients who have PRFs. (Running Query Tool reports that 
    include patients with PRFs will not cause Care Management to display
    the PRFs. Care Management will display the PRFs only if users
    subsequently display details associated with specific query results.)
  
 Other modifications introduce the following changes in Care Management's 
 dashboard and patient list functionality: 
  
 1) Users will have access to a Go to Chart link from Care Management's
    patient-demographics display. This enables users to open patients'
    charts in CPRS when patients appear on their dashboard but do not have
    associated headlights. 
 2) Users will also have access to a Go to Chart link from Care 
    Management's display of detailed results associated with items in Query
    Tool reports. This enables users to more fully investigate the results
    in CPRS without having to close the Care Management Query Tool
    perspective.  
 3) With this patch, patients who have only notifications that fall into
    Care Management's "Other Notifications" category will appear on users'
    Dynamic patient list. Furthermore, Care Management will display for
    these patients a headlight in its Events column. (Prior to this patch,
    patients having only notifications that fall into Care Management's
    "Other Notifications" category appear on users' Dynamic patient list
    ONLY if they have at least one headlight in another column.)
 4) Care Management will now display in its Sign column a headlight for
    users who have documents to sign as a result of being identified as an
    additional signer. Users will also be able to view these documents and 
    add them to their Sign List perspective.  
 5) Because both abnormal and critical results trigger red-square 
    headlights in Care Management's Results column, the hover-hint for
    these headlights now reads "Critical/Abnormal," when before it read
    "Critical."
 6) High priority tasks will appear with a red square headlight in the Care
    Management dashboards. This patch will change the hover-hint to read
    "High Priority" when before it read "Critical"
 7) Finally, this patch adds a Cancel button to the Patient List Name 
    dialog box, which Care Management presents when users are creating
    custom patient lists. Before this patch, users had no way to exit the
    Patient List Name dialog box without saving a new patient list. Note:
    this change affects patient-list creation for both Clinician and Nurse
    Dashboard users.
  
 This patch also introduces some sign-on modifications to the Care
 Management application.
  
 With this patch, Care Management will have Simplified Sign-on and will be
 CCOW User Context (SSO/UC) enabled.
  
 This patch also overrides the 10 second default VistALink socket timeout 
 in VistALink (VL) 1.5.  The new timeout is set to 5 minutes.
  
 The following features and functionality are provided by the Simplified 
 Sign-On/User Context (SSO/UC) project:
  
 Single entry of access and verify codes with which to authenticate and 
 sign on to multiple CCOW-enabled and SSO/UC-aware applications (e.g., 
 Care Management [CM], Computerized Patient Record System [CPRS], Vitals) 
 using the same VistA system. 
  
 Specifically, 
  
 1. If Care Management is the first SSO/UC application to be launched on 
    the clinician's desktop, the current login screen appears and the user 
    would have to login with their Access/Verify code.  Thereafter, any 
    CCOW-enabled and SSO/UC aware application, launched on the desktop and
    connecting to the same M server, will not have to login.
  
 2. On the other hand, if another CCOW-enabled and SSO/UC aware application
    is already running on the desktop and then, Care Management is launched
    and is connecting to the same M server, the user would not have to
    login again.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
  ===========================
  The VHA strongly recommends that you install this patch in a test 
  environment before installing it in production.
  
  As mentioned above, this patch contains two components: an M build and 
  Java plug-ins. You must install these components in a specific order for
  the changes to take effect and to avoid client/server mismatches.
  
  You should install this patch at non-peak hours. Installation should 
  take less than 5 minutes. Users may remain on the system during
  installation.
  
  First: Take the following steps to install the M build:  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
       select the Installation menu.
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ORRC*1.0*2):
           a.  Backup a Transport Global
           b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ORRC*1.0*2
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//',respond YES.
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//' respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   
  Second: Take the following steps to install the Java plug-ins:
   1. Unzip the file ORRC_1_2.ZIP into the HEVD directory on the 
      HealtheVet server.
  
      When prompted with: This folder already contains a file named
                          'example.settings'.
                          Would you like to replace the existing file?
                          Reply Yes To All 
  
      NOTE: When unzipping, regardless of the application used to unzip, 
            please be sure that the application is set to use folder names
            so that the files included in the zip are extracted to the
            appropriate folders.
  
   2. After unzipping the ORRC_1_2.zip file into the HEVD directory this
      will:
           a. Install the plug-ins in the plugins directory
           b. Place files named config_1.2.0.xml and testconfig_1.2.0.xml
              in the HEVD root directory
           c. Replace the previous example.settings file with the new 
              example.settings file in the HEVD root directory.
  
   3. Delete the config_old.xml and testconfig_old.xml files from the HEVD
      directory if they currently exist.
  
   4. To make the plug-ins active, rename the current config.xml file to 
      config_old.xml. Then rename the config_1.2.0.xml file to 
      config.xml
  
      NOTE: If you are installing the plug-ins into a test environment, 
            rename the current testconfig.xml file to testconfig_old.xml.
            Then rename the testconfig_1.2.0.xml to testconfig.xml
  
   5. There is no need to modify the config.settings file for proper 
      installation of this patch.
  
   6. At such time you are confident in the functionality contained in this
      patch, the config_old.xml and testconfig_old.xml files may be deleted
      from the HEVD directory.
