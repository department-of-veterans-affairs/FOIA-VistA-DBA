 Remedy Overview
 =====================
 1)HD0000000179224  Prosthetics Patient Sensitive Info   Temp saved to
                                           C:\NPPDDownload
   
 Problem:
 -------------
 Throughout the Prosthetics GUI, while exporting data to excel a .csv
 file is temporarily saved to the hard drive.  The location of this
 temporary file, which may contain patient identifiable information,
 is hard coded.  It has been decided the user should have the ability
 to specify a secure location to temporarily save this file. 
   
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 Upon clicking the excel button to export the information a message
 box pops up notifying the user that they are about to export potential
 patient identifiable information and they have the ability to select
 "OK  to proceed or "Cancel  to quit.  If they select "OK , a dialog
 box pops up allowing the user to select a directory.  Once they 
 choose a directory the temporary .csv opens allowing
 the user to permanently save the report if they choose.  The user will
 be unable to export another report or navigate away from the form
 until the temporary .csv file is closed allowing it to be deleted.
 To assist the user in locating the temporary .csv file, the path will
 be displayed on the current form.
  
  
 2)HD0000000188410 -Shipping Charges limited to 5 char including
                                          decimal
  
 Problem:
 -------------
 In the Prosthetics GUI while entering the shipping amount you are 
 limited to 5 characters including two decimal digits.  
 This is inconsistent with the VistA data dictionary (file 660 field #6) 
 which allows 8 characters including two decimal digits. 
   
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 Change the MaxLength property on the EdtShipping edit box to allow 8 
 characters.  In vista the field is defined as a number between 0 and 
 99999 a decimal and two decimal places.

                                                    display
  
 Problem:
 -------------
 In the Prosthetics GUI, currently the HCPCS display on the Purchase
 Order Add Item form does not display the full descriptions for the
 NIF item numbers and users are unable to differentiate between
 similar descriptions.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 Expand the HCPCS display box to account for the maximum of 60
 characters to accommodate for the new HCPCS descriptions.
