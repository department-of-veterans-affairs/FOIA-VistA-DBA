This patch addresses the issue of an inpatient's medication's stop time 
"BLD",6970,1,5,0)
being inadvertently set to 24 hours.
"BLD",6970,1,6,0)
 
"BLD",6970,1,7,0)
A medical student at a site erroneously changed the location of an 
"BLD",6970,1,8,0)
inpatient while ordering a unit dose medication in CPRS.  The clinic 
"BLD",6970,1,9,0)
location the student chose had a default stop time on orders of 24 
"BLD",6970,1,10,0)
hours.  When the pharmacist finished the order, it was not noticed that 
"BLD",6970,1,11,0)
the stop date was 24 hours, not the normal default stop date for an 
"BLD",6970,1,12,0)
inpatient's medication orders.  As a result, the patient did not receive 
"BLD",6970,1,13,0)
his/her medication as prescribed.  The inpatient meds code in VistA 
"BLD",6970,1,14,0)
assumed the order was an IMO (Inpatient Medications for Outpatients) 
"BLD",6970,1,15,0)
order because it had a clinic location.  The code will be updated to 
"BLD",6970,1,16,0)
recognize a unit dose.
