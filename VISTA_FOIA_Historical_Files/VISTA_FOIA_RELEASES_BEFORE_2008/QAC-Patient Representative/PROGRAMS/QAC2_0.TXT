INSTALLATION GUIDE
RELEASE NOTES






Version 2.0

July 1995













Hines IRM Field Office
Hines, Illinois




This software was developed with Kernel V. 7.1 (Toolkit V. 7.2) and requires Kernel V. 7.1, VA 
FileMan V. 21, and PIMS (MAS) V. 5.3 or later versions.  Journaling need not be suspended during 
the installation.

Please ensure that all QA end users are off the system.  Other users may remain on.  It is 
recommended that the installation be done at a time of low activity.  Installation takes less than 10 
minutes.

Resource Requirements:

All reports use 80 column prints.  Users should have at least a terminal and printer available.

CPU capacity is minimal.  

Disk capacity:  Multiply the number of records in the file times a minimum of 1.3K to a maximum of 
2K.

Checklist Prior to Package Installation:
	
New Issue Codes were shipped with this version of the software.  If you are running the first 
version of the software, the installation will not convert the old codes to the new codes.  
Installation will set the old issue codes to inactive.  After installation of the software, you will see 
only the new codes (both header codes and individual codes) beginning with two alpha characters.  

The old codes will continue to show up in most reports.  They will not appear in the spreadsheet 
report, Issue Code Headings (# Issues); only the new header codes will be printed.

q	If your users built local Issue Codes using the option Issue Code Enter/Edit in version 1.0, 
obtain a printout of these Issue Codes during installation of the software.  With the list, they 
can re-build the codes under the new header codes using the same option.

q	If your users built any macros in Ad Hoc that they want to preserve, have them obtain a 
copy of the sort and print fields before you install this version by doing the following:

	Enter [I at the "Sort selection" prompt #1 and ?? at the "Inquire sort macro name".  Enter 
the macro(s) that you want to see at the "Inquire sort macro name" prompt.

	Enter a sort selection to get to the "Print selection" prompt and repeat the same steps to 
obtain information on your print macros.

	All macros will be removed from the Ad Hoc Report with the installation of this new version 
of the software.  You will need to rebuild those macros you want using the new Ad Hoc 
Report.

q	If your site has Patient Representatives, or positions comparable, working for services or 
wards and the Patient Rep ADPAC wants them to have access only to those records they 
created, then do the following:

	Obtain a list of those users and give them the new User Menu (QAC USER) after installing 
the program.  It contains the options: Edit Contact Record, Enter New Contact, and Send or 
Kill an Alert.

Process:

Do not delete any of the QAQ* routines prior to loading this package.  A pre-init routine 
will take care of the loading and/or deleting of the appropriate QAQ routines.  

1.	There are two reports in the installation that you may want to send to a device for a hard copy.  
Make sure a printer is available.

2.	Load the QAC*, QAQI*, and QAI* routines into the account where the ^QA global resides or 
where you want it to reside.  If ^QA global does not exist, please place it by using the GLOMAN 
(DSM), %GCH (MSM), or other appropriate global utility.

4.	Run the NTEG for the QAC* and QAQ* routines then delete the QACI* and QAQI* routines 
following the installation.

5.	If your site did not use the previous version, assign the QAC MAIN menu to the Patient 
Representative ADPAC.  Any key assignments can be done by owners of the QAC MAIN menu.  
Tell the ADPAC to read through the Package Set-up and Maintenance chapter of the Patient 
Representative User Manual and the Release Notes in this guide.

Post Installation:

There are four messages you may get when running the Patient Representative Service Conversion 
Report.  Whenever you see "*", it means the service could not be converted. 

Message:
What to do:


No conversion problems found.
Do nothing.


*No Issue Codes found, cannot convert services.
This  means that for that particular record 
there is a service but no issue code.  Service in 
this version of the software falls within the 
Issue Code multiple, therefore the service could 
not be converted.  You can edit the record by 
adding an Issue Code.


* No Serv/Sect's for National Serv (Service 
name).
Edit file #49 using VA FileMan.  Select the 
Service/Section that the National Service 
corresponds to and edit the field National 
Service.


Multiple Serv/Sect's for National Serv (Service 
name).
In this case, the contact record may need to be 
edited.  If closed, reopen the record.  Select each 
Issue Code and delete the service you do not 
want. 


Rerun the routine QACCONV0 if you made corrections for either of the two messages with 
asterisks.


Release Notes for Patient Representative Version 2.0

File Changes:

1.  In the Consumer Contact file #745.1: 

a.  The Category of Care field #16 was starred for deletion.  It will no longer be needed since the 
Quality Matrix changed its definitions.  If the Quality Matrix wants data from this package, 
it can obtain what it needs by using the Treatment Status field (Inpatient, Outpatient, 
Domiciliary, or NHCU), the Services Involved field, and the issue code.

b.	The Services Involved field #15 was starred for deletion.  
	A new field Serv/Sect Involved that points to the Service/Section file #49 instead of the 
National Service file #730 was added as a multiple under the Issue Codes field.  This will 
allow the sites to obtain a more accurate count of issues by service and section.
	
	In the previous version, each Issue Code for a contact could not be separated out by each 
service that was associated with the contact.  A data conversion (from File #730 to file #49) 
during installation of the software placed every service associated with a contact under each 
Issue Code associated with the contact therefore not changing any of the previous numbers.  
If users want to, they can go back and edit any of the old contacts and place the Issue Codes 
with specific services.  Any new contact entered will allow the user to enter an Issue Code 
and then one or more services associated with the Issue Code.

c.	The Refer To field #18 is starred for deletion.  It is now called Refer Contact To (multiple) 
and is a pointer to the New Person file #200.  This allows the program to use this field with 
the Alert system to automatically send Reports of Contact to the entries in the Refer Contact 
To field.

d.	Congressional Contact field #29 was added to File #745.1.  It points to a new file, 
Congressional Office file #745.4.  There is a screen on this field to only see Active entries in 
the Congressional Office file.

d.	A new cross-reference (CMB) on field Contact Made By is used for sorting and by the 
Congressional Contact field.  A Trigger cross reference is used to make sure anytime the 
Contact Made By field is edited, the Congressional Contact field is updated, edited, deleted.

e.	The Report of Contact Generated field #23 is starred for deletion.

f.	Survey ("S") was added as another code in the Source of Contact field #13.



2.  In the Contact Issue Code file #745.2:

a.  A trigger cross-reference was added to the Status field #4.  Whenever the status is entered as 
1 or Inactive, a date is entered in the Inactivation Date field.  If the status is changed back 
to Local (active), then the date is deleted from the Inactivation Date field.

b.  The Quality Aspect field #3 was starred for deletion.

c.  Inactivation Date was added as a new field #6.

3.  The Quality Matrix file #745.3 is starred for deletion.

4.	The Congressional Contact file #745.4 was added.  

	The Congressional Office field #29 in file 745.1 points to this new file.  Anytime a user selects 
CO Congressional from the set of codes for the field Contact Made By, the user will also be able 
to select the office or person who made the contact. 
 
	The .01 field of this file, Office/Name, has two cross-references: a regular x-ref for sorting and 
look-up and an Uppercase x-ref.

Issue Codes:

1.  All old Issue Codes (any issue code beginning with one (1) Alpha character) will be set Inactive.  
This will remove the issue codes from any look-up lists in the program.  Most reports, excluding 
any that look at just header codes , will still print data concerning the old codes.

2.  Contact Issue Code numbers now begin with 2 Alpha characters that relate somewhat to the 
header issue (e.g., CA for PATIENT CARE, TI for TIMELINESS, CC for COURTESY / 
COMMUNICATION, etc.)

3.  Issue Code prompt:

a.  At the "Select ISSUE CODE:" prompt, the user can enter "?ISSUE CODE (e.g., ?CA04) and 
get the definition for the code.

	Example:
 	
	Select ISSUE CODE: ?CA04

	CA04   Implementation of procedures
  
	The patient/family believes the appropriate procedure(s) were not implemented to achieve the 
optimal care/needs of the patient.

b.  If the users want to see a display of previously entered Issue Codes with the service/section involved, 
see Site Parameters.


Option Changes:

1.  Enter New Contact:

a.  We are displaying the Rated Disabilities of a patient following the display of patient data 
(SSN, age, sex, etc.).

b.  The user will no longer see the prompts for:
	Category of Care
	Refer To 
	Services Involved 

c.  There are three new fields:

	Refer Contact To:  points to the New Person file #200.
	Serv/Sect Involved:  multiple points to the Service/Section file #49
	Congressional Office: appears when CO for Contact Made is selected

2.  Patient Representative Keys:  A QAC EDIT key was added to the software and users may be 
given the key via this option.  Only users holding the QAC EDIT key (Patient Rep Edit Key) can 
edit any record.  Other users may only edit records they have created. 

3.  Report of Contact:  The confidentiality statement was removed from the ROC and replaced with "This 
information is not for the Patient Record".
	"Distribution:" was removed from the ROC.  Instead, data from the Refer Contact To field was added.

4.  Ad Hoc Report:  No Macro reports were sent with this version of the software.  Each of the 
macros from version 1.0 were turned into separate options in this version.  If the users at your 
site have defined specific macros for their site, they should copy the sort and print fields and 
their modifiers for those reports before installing this software.    

5.  Contact Inquiry:  Users may now print inquiries for all records falling within a selected date 
range.

New Options:

1.  Set-up and Maintenance Menu:

Archive Report:  This option does not purge records but provides an output of selected contact 
record data that can be saved to a file, printed, or captured for a word processing package.  
Records can then be purged using the option Purge Contact Records.

Congressional Contact Enter/Edit:  Users may enter offices or names for congressional contacts 
into the Congressional Office file #745.4 via this option.  These congressional contacts are used 
as a look-up list for the Congressional Contact field # 29 during entry or edit of a contact record.  
The Congressional Contact field only appears when the user enters CO as the Contact Made By.

Purge Contact Records:  This option purges all records that fall within the selected date range.

Site Parameters Edit: 
	
a.  One displays the previously entered Issue Codes and Services in the Edit option just prior to the 
Select ISSUE CODE field.

	To field using the Alert system.  

2.  Responses Due:  This option prints a report of all Open cases whose responses are due within a 
selected time frame.

3.  Send or Kill an Alert:  See Report of Contact Alerts below:

4.  Reports Menu:  Many of these reports used to be obtained via Ad Hoc.

Patient Name with Brief Data:  This option lists for a selected date range and patients, the 
patient name, SSN, contact record number, issue codes, services and Issue text.

Contacts with No Patient Identified:  This report prints out all contact records for a selected 
date range that are not contacts for a specific patient.

Daily List of Patient Contacts:  This listing provides a daily printout of contacts for the selected 
days.

Report by Employee:  This print provides the contact record number, patient name, date of the 
contact, location and issue text for contacts concerning employees.

List of Open Cases:  This print provides a listing of open cases for a selected date range.

Statistical Reports Menu:  Each report in this menu prints a count by the subject in the option 
name.

Employee Contact Totals
Issue Totals for All, Male, or Female
Service Issue Totals
Service/Section Contact Totals
Spreadsheet Report:  	Contains 9 different spreadsheet totals for subject.  Commas are 
used as delimiters between the subject and count.

User Menu:  A User Menu was added for those sites that want certain users to enter new 
contacts and edit only those contacts.  The option also provides the ability to send Reports of 
Contact via the alert system.  This menu contains the following options:

Enter New Contact
Edit Contact Record
Send or Kill an Alert

Keys:

The QAC EDIT key is new.  Only users holding the QAC EDIT key (Patient Rep Edit Key) can edit 
any record.  Other users may only edit records they have created or send/kill alerts (ROCs) on 
records they created.  Users can be given this key via the option Patient Representative Keys.

The QAC CONTACT key is unchanged.

Report of Contact Alerts:

If the site chooses to send Reports of Contact automatically via the Alert System, the field Automatic ROC 
Alert in the Site Parameters Edit option must contain a YES.  When the field contains a YES, any entry 
(person) in the field Refer Contact To will receive a Report of Contact via the Alert system.  Responses to 
the alert are automatically laid into the field Resolution Comments where they can be edited.  The option 
Send or Kill an Alert also requires that a YES be entered in the automatic ROC Alert field.

If the site chooses not to send ROCs in this manner, the site can send a mail message containing the ROC 
using P-MESS at the device prompt in the option Report of Contact.  Responses to the mail message will not 
be automatically laid into the Resolution Comments field.

When the Alert system is used, each recipient gets a separate alert so their responses are not seen by any 
other person.  Responses by the recipient to the alert are automatically laid into the field Resolution 
Comments and may be edited further by the Patient Rep.  If a response cannot be automatically sent at the 
time it is entered, it is tasked until it can be laid into the record.  This should only happen if the record is 
being edited at the time the response is sent.  Also, if the user begins to respond and then times out, the 
partial response is saved for at least 2 weeks for editing.  Any Alert not answered may be purged from the 
system by IRM.  Once a response is entered and saved, editing by the sender of the response is not possible 
(this is similar to the way MailMan works).  Editing of any response can be done via the field Resolution 
Comments by the Patient Representative.

Responses to Alerts trigger an Information Only Alert back to the original sender of the ROC.

Send or Kill an Alert:  This option is used to send a Report of Contact to any DHCP user.  It allows 
the user to enter a response.  The response is automatically added to the Resolution Comments field 
of the Consumer Contact file #745.1.

Write Statements:

All Write statements were removed from the DDs except for Identifier Write statements.
