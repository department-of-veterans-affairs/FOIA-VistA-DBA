 NOIS Overview
 -------------
 1. LAN-0596-61780     LOCATION DIFFERENCES
  
    Problem:
    -------
    This patch addresses an anomaly in the Trace Movement History [RT
    INQ-TRACE] option whereby two transactions that occur within the same
    minute are displayed out of sequence.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Routine RTNQ1 has been modified to address this issue.  The option will
    correctly sort the transactions, even when they occur within the same
    minute, by presenting the transactions in a reverse-date sort order.
  
 2. MUS-1097-70090     No record of initial creation
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Sometimes, the creation of new volumes do not appear on the Trace
    Movement History [RT INQ-TRACE] report when using the New Volume
    Creation [RT TRANS-NEW-VOL] option, the Multiple New Volume Creation
    [RT TRANS-NEW-VOL-MULTI] option, the Create a Label/Record/Volume [RT
    TRANS-CREATE] option, the Create MAS Labels/Records/Volumes [RT
    MAS-LABEL-PRINT] option, or the Create Record/Volume for transferred
    Record [RT TRANSFER-CREATE].  This occurs when an "^" is used to exit
    these options after answering 'YES' to the create a new record/volume
    prompt and if appropriate, choosing the record type.  The new volume is
    created, but the initial creation event is not entered in the RECORD
    MOVEMENT HISTORY (#190.3) file.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Routine RTDPA1 has been modified to prevent using an "^" to exit these
    options during the creation of the new volumes.  
  
 3. MAD-0500-41122     NEW VOLUME NOT BEING RECOGNIZED ON PULL LIST
  
    Problem:
    -------
    A problem was reported with the creation of new volumes (options
    Create a Label/Record/Volume [RT TRANS-CREATE], Create MAS
    Labels/Records/Volumes [RT MAS-LABEL-PRINT], New Volume Creation [RT
    TRANS-NEW-VOL], Multiple New Volume Creation [RT TRANS-NEW-VOL-MULTI],
    and Create Record/Volume for transferred Record [RT TRANSFER-CREATE]).
    After the creation of the new volume, the user is displayed the prompt:
  
    Pending Requests can be transferred to last Record/Volume just created.
            Transfer Requests to volume '2' ? No//  <====enters Yes here
  
    If the user answers 'Yes', Requests with a Request Status of 'REQUESTED'
    are moved to the new volume, but the user is not notified that there are
    other requests which are not being transferred to the new volume because
    of their Request Status.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    This patch creates a message display for any requests that are not
    transferred to the new volume.  A sample of the format used for the new
    display is:
  
       The following request(s) cannot be transferred due to Request Status:
         Request for APR 27, 2000 for ORTHO - JONES - Status is NOT FILLABLE
         Request for APR 28, 2000 for MEDICAL CLINIC - Status is CANCELLED
  
    Routine RTT12 has been modified to introduce this new display.
