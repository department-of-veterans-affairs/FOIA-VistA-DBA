Subject: GWOT COMBAT VET DEFAULT TO YES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 In backdoor pharmacy, when placing a new order, renewing an existing
 order, or copying an order to a new order, if a patient is eligible for
 COMBAT VET (CV), the default answer to the prompt "Was treatment related
 to Combat" is currently presented as Null. This patch will change the
 default answer, currently Null, to 'Yes'.
  
 Note:
  
 When finishing a pending order the current functionality related to the
 CV question will remain the same, i.e., the default answer will be set to
 either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on what is being marked by the provider.
