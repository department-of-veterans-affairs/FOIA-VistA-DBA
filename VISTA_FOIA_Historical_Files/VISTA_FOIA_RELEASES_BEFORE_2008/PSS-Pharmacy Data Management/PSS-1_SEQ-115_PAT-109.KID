During testing of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) project 
"BLD",6176,1,2,0)
BCMA-HSC Phase III, an issue was discovered with the order flag comments 
"BLD",6176,1,3,0)
for unit dose orders. There is not enough space to store the entire 
"BLD",6176,1,4,0)
comment, so the text is truncated. This patch corrects this problem for 
"BLD",6176,1,5,0)
BCMA by storing the most recent text in an additional location. The 
"BLD",6176,1,6,0)
comment will still be stored in the current location. It will also be in 
"BLD",6176,1,7,0)
the MOST RECEMT FLAG COMMENT field (#129) of the NON-VERIFIED/PENDING file
"BLD",6176,1,8,0)
(#53.1) which is exported in an Inpatient Medications V5.0 patch. For
"BLD",6176,1,9,0)
active unit dose orders, it will be stored in the MOST RECENT FLAG COMMENT
"BLD",6176,1,10,0)
field (#128) of the UNIT DOSE sub-file (#55.06) of the PHARMACY PATIENT
"BLD",6176,1,11,0)
file (#55) which is exported in this patch.
