Associated patches: (v)FH*5.5*1    <<= must be installed BEFORE `FH*5.5*3'

Subject: Changes to Meal Production Report and TF Quantity fixes

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. The Meal Production Reports [FHPRO5] option has been modified to 
    include Advance Food Preparation functionality, and other fixes and
    enhancements:  
     
    a) The sequence of prompts has been changed to include Advance Food 
    Preparation functionality, to add the "N" defaults for all the 
    sub-reports, and to correct erroneous logic discovered between the 
    Production Facility and Communication Offices prompts.  (This erroneous
    logic was discovered by the HSD&D developers as they were incorporating
    AFP functionality changes).  Before patch FH*5.5*3, users could select 
    any Communication Office even if it did not belong to the Production 
    Facility being printed.  After the installation of FH*5.5*3, in order
    to print a specific (just one) Communication Office, it must be linked
    to a Production Facility (using option Enter/Edit Communication
    Offices).  However, if sites choose not to link, sites can only select
    'ALL' at the 'Select COMMUNICATION OFFICE (or ALL)' prompt.  Below is
    an example of the new prompts:
     
 Select OPTION NAME: MEAL PRODUCTION REPORTS  FHPRO5     Meal Production 
 Reports Meal Production Reports
  
 Select PRODUCTION FACILITY:    MAIN KITCHEN  
  
 Use CENSUS or FORECAST? (C OR F): C
  
 Select COMMUNICATION OFFICE (or ALL): ALL// ??      --->users can only 
                                                         select Comm
                                                         Offices) if
                                                         report is being
                                                         run for a specific
                                                         Comm Office.
  
    Choose from:
    ALRIGHTY THEN!     (** Inactive **)
    HINES COMM OFFICE     
     
  
 Select COMMUNICATION OFFICE (or ALL): ALL// HINES COMM OFFICE    
  
 Select Start Date: T  (JAN 26, 2006)
  
 Select End Date: T+5  (JAN 31, 2006)
  
 Select Starting and Ending MEAL (B, N, E, B-B, B-N, B-E, N-B, N-N, N-E, 
 E-B, E-N, E-E, or ALL): ALL// B-N
  
 Do you want PRODUCTION Summary? (Y/N) N// 
  
 Do you want MEAL SERVICE Summary? (Y/N) N// Y
  
 Do you want RECIPE PREPARATION Sheet? (Y/N) N// Y
  
 Do you want STOREROOM REQUISITION Sheet? (Y/N) N// 
  
 Do you want PRINTED RECIPES? (Y/N) N// 
  
 Do you want Advance Food Prep? (Y/N) N// 
  
 Do you want Storeroom Requisition for AFP? (Y/N) N// 
  
 Do you want Printed Recipes for AFP? (Y/N) N// 
  
 The report requires a 132 column printer.
  
  
 Select LIST Printer: HOME//   TELNET    Right Margin: 80//
  
   
    b) When generating Meal Production Reports by CENSUS, only 
    Communication Offices with a link to a Production Facility are
    selectable if the report is being run for that specific Communication
    Office.  A screen has been added to prevent selecting a Communication
    Office that is not linked to a Production Facility.
     
    c) The ability to enter a date range by entering starting and ending 
    dates has been added.
     
    d) The ability to enter a combination of meals has been added.  For 
    example: B for Breakfast, N for Noon, or B-E for Breakfast from the 
    starting date to Evening of the ending date and all meals in between,
    or All for All meals, or any combination separated by a hyphen.
     
    e) All sub-reports under Meal Production Reports have been modified to 
    include all the data depending on the number of days selected. New 
    sub-reports Advance Food Prep (Grand Total), AFP Storeroom Requisition 
    and AFP Adjusted Recipes are being added which will include all meals 
    within the dates requested.
   
   
 2. The Enter/Edit Communication Offices [FHPRO9] option has been 
    modified to add the ability to enter/edit a Production Facility.  In 
    order to print a specific or only one (not ALL) Communication Office
    when running Meal Production Reports for CENSUS, a Production Facility
    must be linked to the Communication Office.  This functionality is
    added to screen the selection of Communication Offices that are not
    associated to a Production Facility and to correct any erroneous logic
    between the Production Facility and Communication Office prompts.
  
    Note: Future DSS Extracts may require that all Communication Offices be
    linked to a Production Facility.  This will allow DSS to determine the 
    production location for various products delivered to the patient.
   
 3. The Tubefeeding # of Units or Quantity in TUBEFEEDING PULL LIST 
    [FHORT5S] and TUBEFEEDING COST [FHORTF5C] reports has been modified so 
    that any units (bottle, can, or pack) will be rounded to the next whole
    number if the unit or quantity has an additional fraction or decimal 
    number.
   
 4. This patch fixes the missing Bread/Beverage default for outpatient 
    meals while running option Print Diet Cards [FHDCRP].  This is reported
    in Remedy ticket # HD0000000106460.
