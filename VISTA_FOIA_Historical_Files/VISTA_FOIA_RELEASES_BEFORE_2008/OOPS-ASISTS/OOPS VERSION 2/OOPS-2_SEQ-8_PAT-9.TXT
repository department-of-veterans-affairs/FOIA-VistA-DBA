Subject: OOPS*2*9 GUI UPDATE DUE TO BROKER REMEDY CASES

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to correct that the ASISTS GUI package is
 currently using a broker component that is not compatible with
 the latest update to the kernel broker software, and a dynamic link 
 library (.DLL) file that is used in hyperlinks in the ASISTS help file
 needs to be included with the installation executable.

 This patch addresses the following REMEDY case(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 HD57597 CHA-1204-30465   Can't Electronically Sign Cases
 HD56848 BHS-1204-10462   Server Not Found
 HD57513 CLE-1204-40460   Data save problem
 HD58297 PUG-1204-50874   Asists gui connection to server could not be made
 HD57469                  Problem with Help File
  
 REMEDY cases 57597,56848,57513,58297 were all caused because ASISTS was
 compiled with a version of the Delphi broker that was updated in 
 conjunction with the release of a new Clinical Context Object 
 Workgroup (CCOW) broker. The version of the broker ASISTS is currently
 using has a defect that has been fixed in a subsequent patch for the
 broker component. ASISTS GUI software will run fine at sites that do not
 have kernel patch XWB*1.1*35 installed. However, once this patch is
 installed, ASISTS software fails any time an attempt is made to send a
 null list as a parameter to a broker call. Re-compiling/releasing ASISTS
 and updating the broker will resolve these reported problems.
  
 REMEDY Case 57469
 In patch 8, the ASISTS Help was updated to include links and jumps to
 external web pages. This change required that any computer attempting
 to use the help file must have the .DLL file INETWH32.DLL on their
 machine either in a system directory, or the directory where ASISTS was
 installed. The majority of computers running ASISTS already have this file,
 but some older computers on previous versions of the Microsoft operating
 systems do not. The install file (OOPS2_9.exe) has been updated to include
 this file in the ASISTS installation directory.
  
  
 ** NOTE **
 ASISTS GUI PATCH 2.8 must be installed prior to installing this patch.

   ==================  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==================
  
 This patch is solely a GUI patch, nothing has changed on the VistA side
 due to this patch. The GUI install script/file will need to be retrieved
 from the normal location for patches. It is a Windows-based executable
 install program, called OOPS2_9.EXE.
  
 Since there is no KIDS build/installation with this patch, the typical 
 install instructions are not used and have been removed from the patch
 documentation. 
  
 Install time: Less than 5 minutes.
