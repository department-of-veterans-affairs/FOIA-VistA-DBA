Description:
============

 1. OKL-1202-71318
    When using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
    option to edit the dispensed drug on an active order, if there is more
    than one drug tied to that Orderable item, if a different drug is
    selected from the displayed drug list, the software prompts "Do You
    want to Edit the SIG? NO//." On selecting "Yes" you are prompted for
    these fields: dosage, verb, dispense unit, noun, route, schedule, 
    duration or the conjunction. If changes are made to any of these 
    fields, you are prompted  "Are You Sure You Want to Update Rx 999999?
    Yes//." When selecting "YES," the software does not update the changes.
    This patch fixes this problem. The issue with dosage selection reported
    in NOIS CLL-0303-40634 is also resolved here.
  
 2. MOU-1202-31080
    Using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, 
    when the drug of an active order is edited, the software checks for the 
    change and prompts "Do You want to Edit the SIG? NO//" and accordingly 
    alerts the user with the message "This change will create a new 
    prescription!." During the completion process of new orders entered 
    through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), if the drug is 
    edited, the software currently does not make any such checks on the
    edited drug. This patch ensures that the same functionality that is
    provided to the drug edits of an active order, is incorporated into the
    drug edits during the completion of orders entered through CPRS.
    Also the completion of pending order process is enhanced in this patch
    to display the message "Pending Order Not Updated!" in the message box
    when an up-arrow (^) is entered at any of the dosage prompts to quit
    the process. This is similar to "Prescription Not Updated!" message
    that is provided when quitting during an edit of an active order with
    an up-arrow (^).
  
 3. CLL-0403-41585
    When using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR 
    ORDERS] option or the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
    option to complete orders entered through Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS), you cannot edit the Orderable Item using the synonym of
    that Orderable Item. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 4. HWH-0303-40364
    When entering complex orders using Patient Prescription Processing 
    [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if an up-arrow (^) and 3 characters 
    are entered at the conjunction prompt in order to correct one of the 
    dosage fields, the software goes into an endless loop going back to the
    beginning of the complex dosage. This happens only if the 3 characters 
    entered do not point to one of the dosage fields. This patch fixes this 
    problem. We also fixed the following related issue: Currently, to jump
    to the Limited Duration field within the dosage edit, you need to enter
    "^DUR" or "^dur," not "^LIM" or "^lim," as expected by many users. This
    patch provides the option of entering "^LIM" or "^lim" or "^DUR" or 
    "^dur," to jump to the Limited Duration field.
                
 5. SBY-0503-30615
    Using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
    when the Orderable Item of an active order is edited to a different 
    item, this will alert the user with the message "New Orderable Item 
    selected. This edit will create a new prescription!" and it will do the
    order checking. During order checking process, if it encounters any
    drug interactions with other active prescriptions, it will display the
    prompts as in the example shown below:
  
      "***CRITICAL*** Drug Interaction with RX #9999999
      DRUG: ASPIRIN BUFFERED 325MG TAB (the drug it had interaction with)
      Do you want to Continue? Y//"
  
    At this prompt if you enter "NO" or up-arrow (^), or you enter "YES"
    and for the next prompt "Do you want to Process medication METHOTREXATE
    2.5MG TAB: P// ?" (drug that is tied to the Orderable Item you 
    selected), if you enter "0" or "^" to Abort, there is a possibility
    of getting an undefined variable error PSODRUG("OIN"). This patch
    corrects this problem.
  
 6. MAC-0503-60991
    Using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
    option, when the drug of an active order is edited to a drug that is
    tied to a different Orderable Item, the software prompts "Do You want
    to Edit the SIG? NO//." On selecting "NO," you are alerted with the
    message "This change will create a new prescription!." When you accept
    the new order, since the dosage information is incomplete you will be
    forced to enter the dosage information. At the prompts: Verb, Schedule,
    Limited Duration or Conjunction, if you enter up-arrow (^) with the
    intention of quitting the order process, you are prompted to fill the
    rest of the fields. When it prompts you "Is this correct? YES//," on
    selecting "YES," there is a possibility of getting an undefined
    variable error PSOX("ENT"). This patch corrects this error.
