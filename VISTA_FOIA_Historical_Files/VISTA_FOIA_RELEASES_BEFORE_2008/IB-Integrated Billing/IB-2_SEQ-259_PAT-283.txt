Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem that many sites have with their CSA 
 screens - Claims Status Awaiting Resolution.  It takes a very long time 
 to compile at many sites.  This patch will permanently fix this problem 
 and the CSA screen should compile very fast.
  
 EDI status messages are stored in the IB BILL STATUS MESSAGE file (file
 #361).  Many sites have tens of thousands of informational, unreviewed
 status messages or informational, reviewed status messages with no final
 review information.  These messages can never get purged because they lack
 this final review data.  This patch attempts to add final review data if
 the messages are identified as Auto-file with no review types of messages.
  
 The following 4 message text entries are being added to the IB MESSAGE 
 SCREEN TEXT file (file #361.3) to Auto-file more status messages with no 
 review needed.
  
    ACK/ACCEPTANCE HAS BEEN ACCEPT
    CLAIM RECEIVED
    COMPLETED: PAYMENT MADE
    FINALIZED-PAYMENT: PAYMENT REF
  
 A new index file is created in the IB BILL STATUS MESSAGE file (file 
 #361).  The ACSA index is created (Index by Message Severity and Review 
 Status).
  
 In order to ensure that these status messages get purged at regular 
 intervals, there is an IB site parameter called "Days To Wait To Purge 
 Msgs" in Set 15 of the IB site parameter screen.  If there is no value in
 this field, then this patch will set the parameter value to be 90 days.
