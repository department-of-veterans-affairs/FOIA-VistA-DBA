Subject: RADIOLOGY REJECTS ORDER FROM CPRS/CPT CODE DISPLAY ISSUE ON PROC-CPT REPORT 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following two issues:
      
 #1 - When the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User 
 Interface (GUI) is used to enter a Radiology order for a procedure that is
 assigned to a CPT code containing a trailing alpha or leading zeros, the
 order is erroneously rejected by Radiology.
      
 #2 - When running the Procedure/CPT Statistics Report [RA CPTSTATS], the
 internal entry number (IEN) is displayed instead of the HCPCS Code.
           
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS
 =========================
 HD125308 - New Radiology Procedures problems with CPT Codes
 HD97373  - EXAM  WORKLOAD MISSING FROM REPORT
      
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1 - HD125308 
 ----------
 The following error message is generated in CPRS GUI Order Entry when a 
 Radiology procedure has an assigned CPT code containing a trailing alpha 
 character or leading zero and causes the order to be rejected erroneously:
      
 "Invalid Procedure, Inactive, no Imaging Type or no Procedure Type"
           
 Resolution #1
 -------------
 A modification has been made to routine RAO7RON1 to allow for alphanumeric
 CPT Codes.
      
 Problem #2 - HD97373
 ----------
 CPT codes have a direct relationship with the internal entry 
 number (IEN) in the CPT FILE (# 81).
      
 HCPCS Codes do not correspond to the internal entry number like 
 CPT codes.  When a HCPCS code is encountered on the Procedure/CPT 
 Statistics Report [RA CPTSTATS], the report will display its internal entry 
 number (IEN) as if it was a CPT code.  ie A9500 will display as 104359.
      
 Resolution #2
 -------------
 A modification will be made to routine RACPT1 to utilize a function call 
 that will display the HCPCS code correctly.
