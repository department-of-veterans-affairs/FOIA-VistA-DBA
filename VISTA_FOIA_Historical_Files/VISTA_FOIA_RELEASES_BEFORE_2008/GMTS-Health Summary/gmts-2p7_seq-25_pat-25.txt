Associated patches: (v)GMTS*2.7*14 <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMTS*2.7*25'

Subject: Component fixes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Included in this patch are changes to a dietetics and radiology
 component as well as a change to two laboratory components.
  
     The Dietetics (DI) Health Summary component           CIN-0497-41067
     now includes outpatient dietetic encounters.
 
     The Microbiology (MIC) and Brief Microbiology         HAM-0896-20195
     (BMIC) Health Summary Components prevents an
     antibiotic from appearing in more than one 
     listing and prevents duplicates in the list.
 
     The Microbiology (MIC) and Brief Microbiology         HUN-0297-21385
     (BMIC) Health Summary Components now includes
     an "OTHER" category for instances where there
     is not a single occurrence of "S", "I" or "R."
 
     The Radiology Profile (RP) Health Summary             GAI-0597-32040
     component radiology report has been reformatted
     to match the report format from the Radiology
     package.

 INSTALLATION:
 =============
 
     This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation
     will take less than two minutes.
  
     1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
         the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
         removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
     3.  On the KIDS menu, under the INSTALLATION menu, use the
         following options:
 
             Print Transport Global                        optional
             Compare Transport Global to Current System    optional
             Verify Checksums in Transport Global          optional
             Backup a Transport Global                     optional
             Install Package(s)                            REQUIRED
 
             when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter GMTS*2.7*25
 
     4.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
         Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO".
  
     5.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should
         be returned to the mapped set once the installation has
         completed.

Routine Information:
====================

Routine Name:
  - GMTSFH

 This routine supports the DIETETICS (DI) Health Summary component and has
 been modified to report all dietetic encounters regardless of the patient's
 status.  The routine no longer quits if the patient is not found in the 
 Dietetics Patient (#115) file.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSRAS

 This routine supports the RADIOLOGY PROFILE (RP) Health Summary component
 and has been modified to print the report sections (history, impression,
 etc) in the same format as the radiology package. 

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSRAE

 This routine supports the RADIOLOGY PROFILE (RP) Health Summary component
 and has been modified to format each line of the radiologist report so
 that it prints like it does within the radiology package. 

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSLRME

 This routine supports both the MICROBIOLOGY (MIC) and the BRIEF 
 MICROBIOLOGY (BMIC) Health Summary components and has been modified so 
 that an antibiotic cannot appear in more than one listing.  Prior to 
 this change, it was possible for an antibiotic to appear in more than 
 one listing or not at all.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSLRM1

 This routine supports the MICROBIOLOGY (MIC) Health Summary component and 
 has been modified by adding "Other" as a new category of report for 
 antibiotics that are not clearly in the "susceptible", "intermediate" or
 "resistant" categories.  These antibiotics will appear in the "Other" 
 listing along with their susceptibility result and default interpretation
 in parentheses.

Routine Checksum:

Routine Name:
  - GMTSLRMB

 This routine supports the BRIEF MICROBIOLOGY (BMIC) Health Summary component
 and has been modified by adding "Other" as a new category of report for
 antibiotics that are not clearly in the "susceptible", "intermediate" or
 "resistant" categories.  These antibiotics will appear in the "Other" 
 listing along with their susceptibility result and default interpretation
 in parentheses.
