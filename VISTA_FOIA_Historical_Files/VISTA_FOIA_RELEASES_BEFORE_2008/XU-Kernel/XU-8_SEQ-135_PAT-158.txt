Subject: FILE #200, SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME INPUT TRANSFORM

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 The input transform on the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME field (#20.2) of
 the NEW PERSON file (#200) checks that the value contains the first comma
 piece of the NAME field (#.01); that is, that the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED
 NAME contains the last name of the person as stored in the NAME field.
  
 The New Person Name Standardization patch XU*8*134 standardized the names
 stored in the NAME field, so the the input transform for SIGNATURE BLOCK
 PRINTED NAME is no longer correct. For example, if
  
          NAME (#.01) = OBRIEN,MARY
  
 A SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME of MARY O'BRIEN should be accepted, but the
 input transform is rejecting it.
  
 This patch modifies that input transform of the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED
 NAME field so that it checks that the STANDARDIZED form of the SIGNATURE
 BLOCK PRINTED NAME contains the first comma piece of the NAME field.
