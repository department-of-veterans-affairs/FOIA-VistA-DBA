 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1. TAM-0303-31335  PTF record will not close for Fee Basis patient.
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 As Reported
 +++++++++++
 PTF records cannot be closed for Fee Basis patients with a Means Test value 
 of Service Connected who have had a service connected treatment. The following 
 message is displayed:
  
 Performing edit checks...
 101 MEANS TEST          value AS inconsistent with eligibility data
  
 As Analyzed
 +++++++++++
 The PTF close-out edit checker is calculating a Means Test Indicator of 
 "AN" for ALL patients whose Means Test Status is Category A (STATUS field 
 (#.03) value in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST file (#408.31) = "A").  In contrast, 
 the Means Test Indicator field (#10) in the PTF file (#45) calculates a value 
 of "AS" for Category A patients under the following conditions:
  
   1. Patient is Fee Basis
   2. VA code number of Admitting Eligibility code = 3
   3. Patient is service connected with 0% and non-compensable.
   4. Patient has had a service connected treatment. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The PTF close-out edit checker has been modified to calculate a Means Test 
 Indicator value of "AS" under the conditions outlined above, which are in 
 accordance with existing business rules for calculating Means Test Status.
  
 2. SFC-1202-61040  Fee basis PTF erroring in Austin on elig.
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 As Reported
 +++++++++++
 A Service Connected veteran PTF (fee basis) record shows incorrect
 MEANS TEST STATUS (NSC MT COPAY EXEMPT) on screen 101 of PTF record.
 The rest of the eligibility fields on screen 101 are correctly reflecting
 that vet is >50% Service Connected.  When changing the Means Test Status 
 field it appears to be changed, but when the screen reappears the old,
 incorrect status remains.
  
 As Analyzed
 +++++++++++
 Both the front-end calculation of the Means Test Indicator (field #10 in 
 the PTF file #45) and the back-end edit checker are setting patients with a 
 Means Test Status of MT COPAY EXEMPT (category A) and service connected 
 with a Service Connected Percentage > 0 as "AN" (NSC MT COPAY EXEMPT).  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The PTF software has been modified to set the MEANS TEST INDICATOR field (#10) 
 in the PTF file (#45) to "AS" for patients who's:
  
   1. MEANS TEST STATUS (field #.03, ANNUAL MEANS TEST file #408.31) is "A", 
      for the current Means Test, and 
   2. PRIMARY ELGIBILITY CODE (field #.361, PATIENT file #2) is "SC LESS 
      THAN 50% "or "SERVICE CONNECTED 50% TO 100%" for the admission record, 
      and
   3. SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (field #.302, Patient file #2) is greater 
      than zero.
  
 3. ISA-1098-12507  SI date when backdating transfer
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 As Reported
 +++++++++++
 When backdating an interward transfer using the TRANSFER A PATIENT option,and 
 putting them on a ward (seriously ill) the computer defaults the date entered 
 on SI list to the present date and not the actual date of the transfer. Users
 then have to go into another option, Seriously ill list entry[DG SERIOUSLY
 ILL ENTRY] and edit the entry, which is additional work.
  
 As Analyzed
 +++++++++++
 When a patient is placed on a seriously ill ward, the CONDITION field 
 (#401.3) in the PATIENT file (#2) is set to "S" and a trigger cross-reference 
 on this field fires which stores the current date ('TODAY') in the
 DATE ENTERED ON SI LIST field (#401.4). Backdating of both patient 
 transfers and admissions to seriously ill wards will cause the patient
 to be placed on the Seriously Ill list on the date the entry was made
 rather than the date of the event.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patient movement software was modified to populate the DATE ENTERED ON SI 
 LIST (#401.4) with the movement date for admissions and transfers
 to seriously ill wards.
  
 4. DAN-0700-40870  BED AVAILABILITY REPORT PROBLEM
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 As Reported
 +++++++++++
 The option DG BED AVAILABILITY produces a listing of available beds by
 ward if the user specifies "ALL" for the ward location.  Since many sites are 
 'mirroring' their beds in order to accommodate observation beds, they are 
 using the dual designation of the rooms.  Unfortunately, this common practice 
 has made this Bed Availability report incorrect.  Consequently, sites have 
 no report to tell them what rooms/beds are currently available.
  
 As Analyzed
 +++++++++++
 This report uses the "W" cross-reference from the WARDS WHICH CAN ASSIGN 
 multiple (#100) in the ROOM-BED file (#405.4) to report available beds by 
 ward, or by ward within service.  This is causing beds to show up on the 
 report as many times as there are entries in the multiple.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A third sorting option, by BED, was added to the report.  This option sorts 
 the output by bed name and lists the wards that can assign each available 
 bed. The total number of beds available is printed at the end of the 
 available bed listing.  The user can select which division(s) and/or 
 ward(s) to print the beds for, and can also choose whether or not to print a 
 list of lodgers occupying beds at the end of the report.
  
 5. NOL-0998-70264  printout format dropping characters
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 As Reported
 +++++++++++
 The Inpatient Roster option report (DG INPATEINT ROSTER) has lost one  
 character in the Room-Bed column.
  
 As Analyzed
 +++++++++++
 DG*5.3*162 moved the Room-Bed field one space to the right and the printed 
 field length was changed from 9 characters to 8 characters to allow for 
 printing the admission date in mm/dd/yyyy format. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Room-Bed was increased to 9 columns.  Means Test was shifted to the right one 
 column to accomplish this.
