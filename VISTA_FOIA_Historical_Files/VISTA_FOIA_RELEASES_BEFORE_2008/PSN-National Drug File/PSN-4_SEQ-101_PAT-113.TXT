Subject: INCORRECT INACTIVATION DATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Under certain circumstances, if an entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
 was reactivated - that is if the INACTIVATION DATE field (#21) was deleted -
 this deletion was not captured in the VA FileMan audits and therefore was
 not transmitted to the field.  The cause of this problem has been removed.
 This patch corrects those entries which have an inactivation date but
 should not.
  
 The following products are reactivated.
  
 CALCIUM 500MG/VITAMIN D 100UNT/VITAMIN K 0.04MG TAB,CHEW
 CARBETAPENTANE 60MG/CHLORPHENIRAMINE 5MG TAB
 CHONDROITIN SULFATE CAP/TAB
 GLUCOSAMINE/S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE (SAM-e) CAP/TAB
 HYALURONIDASE 1500UNT/VIL INJ
 HYALURONIDASE 150UNT/ML INJ
 HYALURONIDASE 150UNT/VIL INJ
 PENTETATE CA TRISODIUM 200MG/ML INJ
