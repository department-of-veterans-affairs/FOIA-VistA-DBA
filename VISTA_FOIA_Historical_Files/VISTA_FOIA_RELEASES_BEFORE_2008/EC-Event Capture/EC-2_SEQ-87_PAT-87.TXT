 EC GUI ENHANCEMENT
 ==================
 Patients with a combat veteran status will be defaulted to "Yes" during data 
 entry.
  
  
 PROBLEM ONE
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000135391: Queued Reports for Future Date and Time.
  
 Problem One:
 -----------
 When QUEUE is selected when printing a report, a default date and time is 
 presented. If the user accepts the presented date/time the report queues with 
 no problem. However, if the user changes the date/time to a future date/time 
 the report does not queue and a window pops up stating date cannot be in the 
 future or invalid date and time format. This occurs for every report in Event 
 Capture.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Procedure TfrmPrintDialog.edtQueueDateTimeExit in the EC GUI source code
 was modified to correct error message "date cannot be in the future or invalid 
 date and time format".
  
 PROBLEM TWO
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000151231:  Problem with multiple patient same procedure not filling
                   second + patients events
 Duplicates:
 HD0000000179806:  EC Volume Display Wrong in Batch Mode
 HD0000000152312:  When Batch enter Patient procs, workload double/triple
  
 Problem Two:
 ------------
 The entry of multiple patients with the same procedure not filing the second-
 third etc patients. The user stated that she uses the Alt-A keystroke to add in
 the past.  After patch 72 the process no longer functions.  She tried using 
 Alt-V(volume) then Alt-A and was able to add additional patients. However, when
 she went back to look at the filing the changed volume had reverted back to one
 and had not filed the volume of two for three patients.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Procedure TfrmEditProcPatients2.bbtnAddClick in the EC GUI source code
 was modified to correct the volume field from reverting back to one when filing
 a record. 
  
 PROBLEM THREE
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000182557:  Associated CPT code error
 Duplicates:
 HD0000000181232:  Event Capture GUI Invalid CPT error message
 HD0000000177456:  event capture won't accept HCPC codes
  
  
 Problem Three:
 --------------
 When attempting to create a local code with an associated CPT code of "S0257" 
 (which is a valid HCPC code for 2007), The GUI version returns an error message 
 stating must use a valid CPT code.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECMFLPX was modified to correct the error message stating must use a 
 valid a CPT code when a user searches for a CPT code that starts with a
 letter.
  
  
 PROBLEM FOUR
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000185360 - FIELDS DEFAULT MISSING AFTER INSTALLATION OF
 Duplicates
 HD0000000185404 - EC*2.0*84 - Default Missing after installation
 HD0000000181242 - Event Capture GUI Ordering Section is populated with more
  
  
 Problem Four:
 -------------
 The Ordering Section should, in fact, populate once a DSS Unit is chosen; 
 however, the Ordering Section should remain populated once a patient is added 
 and the screen is cleared to enter another patient.  Also, once the Associated 
 Clinic is chosen for the for the first patient, the Associated Clinic should 
 also remain for the remaining patients. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Procedure TfrmMultiple1.ClearPatientDataFields in the EC GUI source code was
 modified to correct the Ordering Section and Associated Clinic fields from 
 displaying the wrong default values.
  
  
  
 PROBLEM FIVE
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000187199:  Infectious Disease Codes -No records found .
 Duplicates:
 HD0000000188680:  unable to enter diagnostic codes when they have a
 leading zero
 HD0000000190524:  Coders cannot enter 070.54 for DX
 HD0000000193420:  certain ICD9 codes cannot be entered
  
 Problem Five:
 -------------
 When user attempts to enter the codes listed as primary or secondary diagnosis
 ,the user receives a message  "No Records Found.  No Diagnoses meeting
 those criteria were found.  Please try another value by which to search"
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Procedure TfrmMultiple1.bbtnDiagnosisClick in the EC GUI source code was
 modified to correct the invalid error message "No Records Found.  
 No Diagnoses meeting those criteria were found. Please try another value by 
 which to search".
