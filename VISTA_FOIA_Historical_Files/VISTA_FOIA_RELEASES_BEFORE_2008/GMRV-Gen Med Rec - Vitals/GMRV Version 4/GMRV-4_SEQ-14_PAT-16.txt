  **********************************************************************
  *  NOTE: This patch is released as a version 4 patch, but facilities *
  *        running version 5 of the Vitals software must install this  *
  *        patch, too.                                                 *

 This patch fixes the following problem:
  
 1) The Vitals Applications Programming Interface (API) used by CPRS to 
 validate a patient's temperature value does not work correctly. A user
 enters a Celsius value (e.g., 36) for a patient's temperature in the CPRS
 vitals data entry screen, but the unit of measurement selected is
 Fahrenheit, not Celsius. CPRS calls the Vitals API to validate the value
 and the unit of measurement. The API should reject the value because the
 unit of measurement (i.e., Fahrenheit) does not correspond with the
 Celsius value. Instead the API validates the data. The value (i.e., 36) is
 stored in the Vitals database.
  
 After this patch, the API will reject the temperature value if it is less 
 than 45 and the unit of measurement is Fahrenheit.
  
 2) The post-installation process will check all of the temperature values
 in the Vitals database. If a value is less than 45, that value will be
 converted to a Fahrenheit value and stored in place of the Celsius value. 
 Entries that are marked as entered-in-error will not be changed. A MailMan
 message will be sent to the person who installed the patch when the
 post-installation is finished. The mail message will contain a summary of
 the number of entries checked and fixed. A detailed listing of entries
 that were changed will be written to a host file, GMRV_4_16.DAT, and
 placed in the directory used by TaskMan. The mail message will also list
 the host file name and directory. [BRX-0104-11921, POR-0801-50396]

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 1) This patch can be installed with users on the system.
    Installation should take less than 2 minutes. However, there is a 
    post-installation data repair process that will be tasked as a
    background job. When the background job is finished the patch installer
    will receive a MailMan message. A host file will contain a detailed 
    listing of the entries changed.
    These routines are not recommended for mapping.
  
 2) Load the Transport Global. 
    If you have version 5 of the Vitals software installed, you will see
    the following message: 'This patch is for Version 4, you are running
    Version 5'. 
    At the 'Want to continue installing this build? NO//' prompt, answer
    YES.
  
 3) (Optional) Run the following KIDS options before installing the patch:
  
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Verify Checksums in Transport Global
               Backup a Transport Global
  
 4) Install the Build GMRV*4.0*16.
  
    If you have version 5 of the Vitals software installed, you will see
    the following message: 'This patch is for Version 4, you are running
    Version 5'. 
    At the 'Want to continue installing this build? NO//' prompt, answer
    YES.
  
    At the 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install' prompt answer
    NO.
  
    At the 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols?' prompt answer NO.
  
 5) Move the routines to other CPUs if appropriate.
