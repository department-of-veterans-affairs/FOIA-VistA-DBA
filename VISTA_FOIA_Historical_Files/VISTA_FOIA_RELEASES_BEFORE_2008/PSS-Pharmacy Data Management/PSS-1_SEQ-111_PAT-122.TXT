Subject: Q2 PHARMACY ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch contains the second quarter enhancements for the Pharmacy Data 
 Management V 1.0 package.  The following data dictionary additions are
 included for PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) and supports modifications made 
 in Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*200.
  
 1.  SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING multiple (#47) - adds the capability 
 to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy label printer(s) to 
 control where the ScripTalk labels print for multi-divisions.  Multiple 
 print devices may be mapped to a ScripTalk printer, and any device 
 defined must have a subtype prefixed with "P-".  This prefix in the 
 subtype indicates that the device is a printer.  If no data is defined in
 this multiple, the ScripTalk printer tied to the division will be used.  
 The use of this multiple builds upon existing ScripTalk functionality, so
 a divisional ScripTalk device must be defined for the mapped device
 functionality to work properly and to have a default device defined.
  
     a.  LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED field (#.01) -  This field contains 
 the Pharmacy label printer(s) that the ScripTalk device is mapped.  When 
 the printer device defined in this field is selected as the Pharmacy 
 print device by the user, ScripTalk labels will print on the 
 corresponding mapped ScripTalk device.
  
     b.  SCRIPTALK DEVICE field (#.02) - This field contains the ScripTalk 
 print device that will be tied to regular Pharmacy label device(s) 
 defined in the "LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED" field.
