Subject: GLOBAL BLOCK COUNT FOR CACHE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  Patch Tracking #: FORUM message #37138585
  
  Test sites:      MONTANA HCS, SAN FRANCISCO VAMC, LITTLE ROCK VAMC,
                   SHREVEPORT VAMC.
  
  Blood Bank Clearance: 1/16/2007

 This patch brings in the support for Cache' sites so that they may
 perform Global Block Counts on subscripted global nodes.  
  
 Please NOTE that Cache'/VMS Sites will need to save the appropriate
 precursor routines as the %-namespaced versions in the current
 installation Namespace/Directory (Installation Instructions, Step 4)
  
 The current versions of Cache' that are supported are Cache' 5.0 and
 5.2.  If you are at a Cache' site running in a distributed
 Data-Application Server model, please note that this utility does not run
 on an Enterprise Cache Protocol (ECP) Application Server.  This utility
 should only be run on an ECP Data Server.
  
 Routines ZTBKC and ZTBKCONT are new to TOOLKIT version 7.3.  However,
 ZTBKC and other ZTBKC* routines have been distributed previously in KERNEL
 as well as in TOOLKIT 7.2 and may exist on your system. The removal of all
 ZTBKC* routines in the TOOLKIT 7.3 distribution was simply an oversight.
 For additional information regarding such missing routines from TOOLKIT
 7.3, please refer to informational patch XU*7.1*40.
  
  The Global Block Count option [XU BLOCK COUNT] can be used
  to count the data blocks in a global.  An entire global or
  a subscripted section can be measured (e.g.: ^DIC or DIC(9.2)).
  The corresponding direct mode utility may be used in
  programmer mode:  D ^%ZTBKC.
  
  In addition to the above, the following items were addressed
  as a result of feedback from current stakeholders/test sites:
  
     1.  Additional help for single and double question mark (?) responses at
          both directory and global prompts.
     2.  Ability to see a list of current directories at the directory 
          prompt.
     3.  If no global is selected at the global prompt, the Global 
          Block Count Utility should not proceed to ask for device.
     4.  Ability to see a list of globals selected.
     5.  Ability to de-select globals from the list of globals selected.
     6.  Handle pagination on the report for when all globals are selected.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
  Install Time   less than 5 minutes.
  
      1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
      installation.  You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan.  All active 
      Kernel Toolkit Block Count processes should be allowed to COMPLETE
      prior to installing this patch.
  
      2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution 
      System) package onto your system.
     
      3.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options: 
            2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            3 Print Transport Global 
            4 Compare Transport Global to Current System
            5 Backup a Transport Global
            6 Install Package(s)
  
            Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                =======
             Install Package(s) 
             Select INSTALL NAME: XT*7.3*80
                                  =========
  
        Logons DO NOT need to be inhibited.
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
  
 Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
                                                       ==
 Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//NO
                                                                      ==
  
      4.  Saving precursor routines to %-namespaced versions:
  
          Cache'/vms Sites will need to save
          the appropriate precursor routines as the %-namespaced versions
          in the current installation Namespace/Directory
          (e.g.:  ZL ZTBKC ZS %ZTBKC ZL ZTBKCONT ZS %ZTBKC1).
