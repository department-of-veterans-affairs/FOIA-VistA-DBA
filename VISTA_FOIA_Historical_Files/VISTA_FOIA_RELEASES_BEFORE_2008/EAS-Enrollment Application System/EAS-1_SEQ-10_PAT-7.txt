 INTRODUCTION
 ============
  
 The software for this patch, EAS*1*7, and associated patches, DG*5.3*433 
 and IVM*2*49, are not being distributed through the National Patch 
 Module.  These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS software 
 distribution (host file).  This patch contains the informational portion 
 of EAS*1*7 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to 
 acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
 This patch (EAS*1*7) introduces enhancements to the VistA Enrollment 
 Application system, needed to support the Millennium Healthcare and 
 Benefit Act, Public Law 106-117 Section 101.  This law defines the 
 application of copayments for veterans receiving Long Term Care (LTC) 
 services.  This patch is one of several patches required to implement the 
 complete functionality.  The following lists the necessary patches in the 
 order they should be installed:
   
   Install 1st (HEC)      Install 2nd (VAMC)      Install 3rd (HEC)
   -----------------      ------------------      -----------------
   IVMB*2*626             EAS*1*7                 IVMB*2*627
                          DG*5.3*433
                          IVM*2*49
   
                          Install 4th (VAMC)
                          -----------------
                          IVM*2*51     
  
 NOTE: To ensure that the patches are installed in the correct order, this 
 patch was not released until IVMB*2*626 was installed at the HEC.   
  
 Phase II of the Long Term Care Copayments project will address the 
 following requirements:
  
 1. Automate the determination of the veteran's exemption from LTC 
 copayments based on eligibility or income.
  
 2. Automate the creation of a LTC copayment exemption test based on the 
 veteran's means test.
  
 3. Allow the creation of a LTC copayment exemption test for those 
 veterans that are not required to take a means test.
  
 4. Send the LTC copayment exemption test to the HEC and share with all 
 sites of record.
  
 5. Revise the "spend down" calculation for fixed and liquid assets.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 1. LTC CO-PAY EXEMPTION File (#714.1)

 3. EASEC ENTER/EDIT INCOME (File #408.21) - this template will be 
 modified to prevent entry in VA PENSION (field #.07) if the Receiving VA 
 Pension indicator in the Patient file (#2) is not equal to Yes.  A 
 modification will be made to prevent entry in SPOUSE VA DISABILITY/COMP 
 (field #.19) during input of veteran's income.

 both the current and previous values are displayed.  
 If a LTC Exemption test is deleted, any associated changes are also 
 deleted.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================  
   * This software distribution requires the following patch be 
     installed:
   
      EAS*1*5
   
   * This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  
     Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
   * This patch should NOT be installed while the IVM BACKGROUND JOB
     [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] is running.
  
   Installation Steps:
   ==================
   
   1. Download the KIDS file EAS_1_P7.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
      directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the
      appropriate directory on your system.
   
   2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION 
      menu, and enter:  EAS_1_P7.KID
   
   3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1*7, DG*5.3*433, or IVM*2*49
      are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this 
      time.
   
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select 
      the Installation menu.
   
   5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EAS*1.0*7).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
   6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select EAS*1.0*7.
   
   7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is
      recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
      rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
   
   8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
      YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
   9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
      DG MEANS TEST ADD                Add a New Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST AUDIT              Means Test Audit Event
      DG MEANS TEST COMPLETE           Complete a Required Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST DELETE             Delete a Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST EDIT               Edit an Existing Means Test
      DG MEANS TEST VIEW EDITING       View Means Test Editing Activity
      DG MEANS TEST VIEW TEST          View a Past Means Test 
      IVM BACKGROUND JOB               IVM BACKGROUND JOB
  
   
  10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
