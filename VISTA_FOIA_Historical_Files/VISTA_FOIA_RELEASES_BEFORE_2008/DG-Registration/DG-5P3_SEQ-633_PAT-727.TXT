Subject: PATIENT TREATMENT FILE(PTF) 501 RECORD MISSING LOSING SPECIALTY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 With the implementation of patch DG*5.3*683 on July 1st, all sites that 
 had patients admitted with the Treating Specialty code 80 were instructed
 to do a Treating Specialty transfer to one of the new nursing home (NH)
 Treating Specialties.  Some PTF records had a missing Losing
 Specialty or incorrect Losing Specialty, therefore, the PTF record could
 not be closed.  This specialty was unable to be filed due to an existing
 validity check not working properly.
