Description:
============

 This patch enhances Scheduling and EWL (Electronic Wait List) 
 functionality, providing a means of tracking service connected 
 appointments and prioritizing veterans waiting for appointments related 
 to their service connected condition. It should be noted that this
 patch will effect outpatient appointment scheduling only and inpatient
 scheduling will not be effected by this patch. Patch IB*2.0*318 will be
 loaded directly following patch SD*5.3*394. This patch will populate the
 BILLABLE APPOINTMENT TYPE file (#352.1) with the new SERVICE CONNECTED
 appointment type.
  
 Patients which are NON-SERVICE CONNECTED will not be affected by this
 patch.
  
 NOTE: See patch description for more detailed information of patch 
       IB*2.0*318.
  
 The SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) field of the PATIENT (#2) file is
 added to the SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) file as the SERVICE CONNECTED 
 PERCENTAGE (#14) field. The option SD EWL BACKGROUND JOB, scheduled as
 a task to run daily, monitors the field SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE
 (#.302) in the PATIENT (#2) file, and appropriately updates the new field
 SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#14) in file SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) when the
 SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) field changes in the PATIENT (#2)
 file. Appropriate MailMan messages regarding changes to the SERVICE 
 CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) field are sent to members of the
 mail group SD EWL BACKGROUND UPDATE, as described below in further detail.
  
 The field SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) is the other new field added to
 file SD WAIT LIST (#409.3), which is set to 'YES' if the EWL entry
 is a priority appointment. Patients with a service connected percentage
 greater than 49% automatically have priority, while those patients with a
 service connected percentage less than 50% only have priority if their 
 requested appointment is related to their service connected condition. If a
 patient's service connected percentage changes, the following rules are
 applied to the patient's service connected priority:
  
    The SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) field will be set to 'YES' 
    if the SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) field changes from
    less than 50% to greater than 49%.  If the SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE
    (#.302) field changes and the SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY is updated, a
    Mailman bulletin with a subject line of "EWL Service Connected Patient
    Update with SC Priority" will be sent to members of the mail group
    SD EWL BACKGROUND UPDATE, listing the patients' names whose SERVICE
    -CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) changed (see Message 1 in 4 Bulletins of
    V.Technical Information in the Release Notes.)
  
    A Mailman bulletin with a subject line of "EWL Service Connection 
    Patient Update with SC Percentage Change" will be sent to members of 
    the mail group SD EWL BACKGROUND UPDATE if the SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE
    (#.302) changes from greater than 49% to less than 50% (see Message 2 in
    4 Bulletins of V. Technical Information in the Release Notes.) This 
    bulletin will also be sent to the above mail group if the SERVICE CONNECTED
    PERCENTAGE (#.302)is initially less than 50% and changes to a differen
    value that is also less than 50%, but less than its initial SERVICE CONNECTED
    PERCENTAGE (#.302) field value.  The bulletin will list the patient(s)
    and include an additional note, "EWL SC PRIORITY MAY REQUIRE MANUAL
    UPDATE. PLEASE REVIEW". Each site will determine whether the SERVICE
    CONNECTION PRIORITY (#15) needs updating and will need to change this
    field manually. The new option Service Connected Wait List (Sch/PCMM)
    Edit [SD WAIT LIST SC PRIORITY EDIT] was created to edit the new field
    SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15). The EWL coordinator at each site 
    should decide who to assign this option to.
  
    NOTE: SC PRIORITY cannot be updated automatically from 'YES' to 'NO' 
          because the EWL entry may have been set up as 'YES' with SC<50%
          if requested appointment is for a service connected condition.
   
 The post init routine SDWLP394 will create the fields SERVICE 
 CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#14) and SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) in
 the SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) file.  If the patient has a value in the SERVICE
 CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) field of the PATIENT (#2) file, the SERVICE
 CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#14)  field is populated with that value. If the
 patient has a service connected percentage of 50% or greater, the routine
 will set the SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) field to "YES".  If the 
 patient has a service connected percentage of less than 50%, the SERVICE 
 CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) will be set to 'NO' by the post init routine. 
 The EWL coordinator can review SERVICE CONNECTED veterans that are less 
 than 50% using the 'Appointment (Sch/PCMM) Wait List Report'[SD WAIT LIST 
 APPT REPORT]. Wait List entries for these veterans may have to be updated 
 to 'YES' if the site prefers to have historical data updated. No mail
 messages are sent when the post init routine is run. The post init routine
 will also populate the 'SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS' protocol with the the
 'SDAM APPT TYPE VALIDATION' event. A message will be displayed to the user
 on successful completion. The routine SDWLP394 is deleted after it runs to
 completion.
  
 The options Appointment (Sch/PCMM) Wait List Report [SD WAIT LIST APPT 
 REPORT] (detailed report only) and Inquire Wait List (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT
 LIST INQUIRY] are modified to display the field SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY
 (#15).
  
 When adding a patient to the WAIT LIST, the patient's service connected 
 percentage and rated disabilities are displayed.  If a patient has a 
 service connected percentage of less than 50%, a prompt will ask if the
 appointment is for a service connected condition (Y or N). If the 
 requested appointment is SERVICE CONNECTED, the SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY
 (#15) field is set to 'YES' and is stored in SD WAIT LIST (#409.3). If a
 patient has a service connected percentage of 50% or greater, the prompt
 will not display and the SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY (#15) field is set to
 "YES" because patients with a service connected percentage of 50% or
 greater automatically have priority.
  
 A new appointment type 'SERVICE CONNECTED' is added to the APPOINTMENT 
 TYPE file (#409.1).  When entering the option 'MAKE APPOINTMENT 
 [MA]'[SDM] or 'UNSCHEDULED VISIT [UN]'[SDI] in APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT 
 [SDAM APPT MGT], users will see each patient's service connected 
 percentage and rated disabilities.  If a patient is less than 50% service 
 connected, a prompt will ask the user if the appointment is for a service 
 connected appointment (Y or N).  The 'APPOINTMENT TYPE ' prompt is then 
 displayed.  If the DEFAULT APPOINTMENT TYPE (#2507) for a clinic in the 
 HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file is 'REGULAR' and the answer to the service 
 connected appointment prompt is Y, then the APPOINTMENT TYPE prompt will 
 change to 'SERVICE CONNECTED'.  If the DEFAULT APPOINTMENT TYPE 
 (#2507) for a clinic in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file is not 'REGULAR' 
 and the answer to the service connected appointment question is Y, the 
 APPOINTMENT TYPE prompt will display the value in the DEFAULT APPOINTMENT 
 TYPE (#2507) field. The user still has the option to enter SERVICE 
 CONNECTED as the appointment type, overriding the default appointment
 type. If the answer to the service connected appointment question is N,
 the APPOINTMENT TYPE prompt will display the value in the DEFAULT
 APPOINTMENT TYPE (#2507) field. If at checkout the provider answers the 
 question 'Is this appointment for an SC condition' different from the 
 answer given by the user making the appointment - the provider's answer 
 will take precedence and set the APPOINTMENT TYPE.
  
 When entering a patient on the SD WAIT LIST or making an appointment, if
 the following discrepancies exist between PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE
 (#.361), SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) and SERVICE CONNECTED?
 (#.301) in the PATIENT file (#2), the error message: "'SC
 Percent','Service Connected' and 'Primary Eligibility Code' are OUT OF
 SYNC, Please CORRECT the problem" is displayed on the screen
 notifying the user:
  
  
         * If SERVICE CONNECTED? (#.301) equals YES, PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY 
           CODE (#.361) must be a service connected eligibility (i.e.
           equals "SC LESS THAN 50%" or "SERVICE CONNECTED 50% to 100%")
           and SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) must be greater than 
           0, or the error message is displayed.
  
         * If SERVICE CONNECTED? (#.301) equals NO, PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY 
           CODE (#.302) must be a non service connected eligibility and 
           SERVICE CONNECTED PERCENTAGE (#.302) must be 0 or NULL, or the
           error message is displayed.
  
 If the SERVICE CONNECTED? (#.301) equals NULL, the following error 
 message is displayed:
  
         * 'SERVICE CONNECTED?' field is blank please update patient 
           record.
  
 If the PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE (#.302) equals NULL, the following error 
 message is displayed:
  
         * 'PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE' field is blank please update patient 
           record.
  
 NOTE: New functionality allows users to select service connected
       appointment type based on service connected percentage leaving end
       users responsible for correcting problems as displayed in error
       messages.
  
 An error was identified in routine SDWLI when PRIORITY is displayed. The
 field 19 was incorrectly used to extract the data element, rather than field
 10. 
  
 Incorrect code:
  
 .S SDWLP=0 I SDWLPRI W !,"Priority -",$$EXTERNAL^DILFD(409.3,19,,SDWLPRI)
  S SDWLP=1
  
 Correct code:
