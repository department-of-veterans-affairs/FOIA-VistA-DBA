 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator.
 
 This patch includes the following modifications and problem resolutions:
 
 1) TREATMENT ABBREVIATED (#165.5,42)
 
    The field TREATMENT PLAN has been renamed TREATMENT ABBREVIATED.
 
 2) SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ... [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]
      RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (RAD)]
 
    If two or more patients in the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT (#70) file had identical
    EXAM DATE (#70.02,.01) values, the [Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search]
    option was only checking the first patient for suspicious malignancies and
    skipping subsequent patients with the same EXAM DATE.
    This has been fixed.
 
 3) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
      MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts [ONCO ABSTRACT-MULTIPLE]
        1 QA Abstract
 
    a) In patch ONC*2.11*44 a new option, [Print Abstract QA (80c)], was
       added.  This option replaced the [Print Abstract-Brief (80c)] option.
       The [Print QA/Multiple Abstracts][QA Abstract] option was still
       tied to the [Print Abstract-Brief (80c)] report.  This has been fixed.
 
    b) The QA REGISTRY ABSTRACTS checklist was only associated with the
       [QA - 10% Complete abstracts] menu selection.  This has been changed.
       If the registrars selects the [QA Abstract] menu selection, the
       QA REGISTRY ABSTRACTS checklist will display with all of the following
       menu selections:
 
       1  All abstracts, One PATIENT
       2  All abstracts, One SITE/GP
       3  All abstracts, One ACCESSION YEAR, One SITE/GP
       4  All abstracts, One ACCESSION YEAR
       5  Complete Abstracts by DATE DX
       6  QA - 10% Complete abstracts
     
 4) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
      QA Print Abstract QA (80c) [ONCO ABSTRACT QA]
    CLASS OF CASE            (#165.5,.04)
    DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION  (#165.5,26)
    
    CLASS OF CASE and DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION have been added to the CANCER
    IDENTIFICATION section of the [QA Print Abstract QA (80c)] report.
 
 5) EXTENSION (CS) (#165.5,30.2) stuffing
 
    For Hematopoietic, Reticuloendothelial, Immunoproliferative, and 
    Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, EXTENSION (CS) be will stuffed with 80
    (Systemic disease) with the following exceptions.
 
    EXTENSION (CS) will NOT be stuffed with 80 for the following histologies.
    These may be coded with 10 (Localized disease) or 80 (Systemic disease).
 
    Plasmacytoma, NOS (M-9731/3)(solitary myeloma)        
    Mast cell sarcoma (M-9740)
    Malignant histiocytosis (M-9750)
    Histiocytic sarcoma (M-9755)
    Langerhans cell sarcoma (M-9756)
    Dendritic cell sarcoma (M-9757, M-9758)
    Myeloid sarcoma (M-9930) 
 
 6) OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF flag
 
    If the registrar encounters the following inter-field edit WARNING he/she
    will now be asked if they want to set the OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF flag
    to "Reviewed".
 
    e.g.
 
     ABSTRACT STATUS: Incomplete// C  Complete
 
     All required data fields have been entered.
 
     Beginning inter-field edit checks...
 
     WARNING: DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION > 5 (7)
              SEQUENCE NUMBER > 00 (02)
              OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF is required
 
     Do you wish to set the OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF flag to 'Reviewed'? Y// ES
 
     No inter-field edit check warnings.
 
 7) SEQUENCE NUMBER (#165.5,.06)
 
    The SEQUENCE NUMBER DESCRIPTION has been modified to more closely match
    the FORDS "Instructions for Coding" on page 34 of the FORDS manual.
 
    The sequence number range for in situ and malignant neoplasms has been
    expanded from 00-35 to 00-59.
 
 8) NAACCR item: Patient ID Number [20] 2-9
 
    The NAACCR data item "Patient ID Number" was being extracted with a value
    of "00000000".  With the implementation of Edits Metafile 11.0B this
    item must now be either <BLANK> or greater than zero.  "Patient ID
    Number" will now be extracted with a value of "99999999".
 
 9) NAACCR GenEdits errors
    Conflict among RX Hosp--Surg Prim Site, Primary Site, and Histologic 
     Type ICD-O-3
    Conflict among RX Summ--Surg Prim Site, Primary Site, and Histologic 
     Type ICD-O-3
 
    In order to resolve the above NAACCR v11.0 edit errors, SURGERY OF PRIMARY
    (F) (#165.5,58.6) and SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F) (#165.5,58.7) will be
    stuffed with code 98 for all C42.0, C42.1, C42.3, C42.4, C76.0-C76.8, and
    C80.9 cases.
 
    NOTE: Any existing C42.0, C42.1, C42.3, C42.4, C76.0-C76.8, or C80.9
    cases will have their SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) and SURGEY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F)
    values converted to 98.
  
 10) SARCOMAS AND RARE TUMORS OF THE LUNG (C34.)
     HEMANGIOSARCOMA (9120/3) AND MESENCHYMOMA, MALIGNANT (8990/3) OF SOFT
     TISSUE SARCOMA 
 
     a) For LUNG (C34.) cases, if the associated histology appears in the
     Collaborative Staging Histology Exclusion Table for Lung, the TNM staging
     fields will be stuffed with the "no staging" values.
 
     b) For SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA cases, if the associated histology is
     HEMANGIOSARCOMA (9120/3) or MESENCHYMOMA, MALIGNANT (8990/3), the TNM
     staging fields will be stuffed with the "no staging" values.
 
     e.g. A lung case with the histology 8802/3 GIANT CELL SARCOMA will be
     stuffed as follows:
 
     No TNM coding/staging available for sarcomas and rare tumors of the lung.
 
     CLINICAL T: T88 NA
     CLINICAL N: N88 NA
     CLINICAL M: M88 NA
 
     STAGE GROUP CLINICAL: NA
 
     STAGED BY (CLINICAL STAGE): Not staged
 
     MULTIMODALITY THERAPY (PATH): NO
     PATHOLOGIC T: T88 NA
     PATHOLOGIC N: N88 NA
     PATHOLOGIC M: M88 NA
 
     STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC: NA
 
     STAGED BY (PATHOLOGIC STAGE): Not staged 
 
     The Histology Exclusion Table for Lung can be found at:
     http://web.facs.org/cstage/lung/Lungajcchistologiestable.html
 
 11) REASON NO SURGERY OF PRIMARY (#165.5,58)
     REASON FOR NO RADIATION      (#165.5,75)
     CHEMOTHERAPY                 (#165.5,53.2)
     CHEMOTHERAPY @FAC            (#165.5,53.3)
     HORMONE THERAPY              (#165.5,54.2)
     HORMONE THERAPY @FAC         (#165.5,54.3)
     IMMUNOTHERAPY                (#165.5,55.2)
     IMMUNOTHERAPY @FAC           (#165.5,55.3)
     HEMA TRANS/ENDOCRINE PROC    (#165.5,153)
     
     The code definitions for the above data items have been modified for
     greater clarity and consistency.
 
 12) NEW DATA ITEMS/NEW OPTION
 
     PSA DATE                   (#165.5,96)
     DRE +/-                    (#165.5,102)
     DRE DATE                   (#165.5,156)
     TNM FORM ASSIGNED          (#165.5,25)
     TNM FORM COMPLETED         (#165.5,44)
     CAP PROTOCOL REVIEW        (#165.5,46)
     CAP TEXT                   (#165.5,47)
     ELAPSED DAYS TO COMPLETION (#165.5,157)
 
     UTL *..Utility Options ... [ONCO UTIL MENU]
       TNM Compute percentage of TNM forms completed [ONC TNM FORMS COMPLETE %]
 
     Eight new data items have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5)
     file:
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     1) PSA DATE
     Records the date on which the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test was
     performed.
 
     2) DRE +/-
     Records the findings of a DRE (Digital Rectal Examination).
 
     3) DRE DATE
     Records the date on which the DRE (Digital Rectal Examination) was
     performed.
 
     PSA DATE, DRE +/- and DRE DATE have been placed in the "Cancer
     Identification" section of the abstract.  They will only appear for
     PROSTATE (C61.9) cases.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     4) TNM FORM ASSIGNED
     Records the date on which the TNM form was assigned to the Managing
     Physician.
 
     5) TNM FORM COMPLETED
     Records the date on which the TNM form was completed by the Managing
     Physician.
 
     TNM FORM ASSIGNED and TNM FORM COMPLETED have been placed in the "Stage
     of Disease at Diagnosis" section of the abstract after the data items
     PHYSICIAN'S STAGE and PHYSICIAN STAGING.  If the case does not support
     staging, TNM FORM ASSIGNED and TNM FORM COMPLETED will be stuffed with
     "00/00/0000".  A new option, [TNM Compute percentage of TNM forms
     completed], has been added to the [UTL *..Utility Options...] menu.  This
     option will compute the percentage of TNM Forms assigned which have been
     completed.   
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     6) CAP PROTOCOL REVIEW
     ACoS requires CAP (College of American Pathologists) Protocol Review of
     cases with surgical resection only.  This data item records the status of
     this review.  
 
     7) CAP TEXT
     Records the reason for CAP (College of American Pathologists) Protocol 
     non-compliance.
 
     CAP PROTOCOL REVIEW and CAP TEXT have been placed in the "First Course of
     Treatment" section of the abstract after the data item RX TEXT-SURGERY.
     The registrar will only be prompted for CAP TEXT if CAP PROTOCOL REVIEW
     has a value of 0 (Failed).
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     8) ELAPSED DAYS TO COMPLETION
     Computes the time interval in days between DATE OF FIRST CONTACT
     (165.5,155) and DATE CASE COMPLETED (165.5,90).
 
     ELAPSED DAYS TO COMPLETION will be computed as needed.
 
     All of these data items will appear on the [PA Print Complete Abstract
     (132c)] report.
 
 13) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
       NC Print Abstract NOT Complete List [ONCO ABSTRACT-NOT COMPLETE]
 
     The PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report has been changed.  The column
     containing PRIMARY SITE values has been replaced with a column containing
     SITE/GP values.  Also, SUBCOUNT and COUNT totals have been added to this
     report.
 
 14) DATE RADIATION STARTED  (#165.5,51)
     REASON FOR NO RADIATION (#165.5,75)
 
     If REASON FOR NO RADIATION equals 8 ( Recommended, unknown if admin),
     DATE RADIATION STARTED (165.5,51) must equal 88/88/8888 (when radiation is
     planned as part of the first course of therapy, but had not been started at
     the time of the most recent follow-up).
 
     If the registrar enters a REASON FOR NO RADIATION value of 8, the program
     will change DATE RADIATION STARTED to 88/88/8888.  This change will prevent
     the EDITS error "Reason for No Radiation and RX Date--Radiation conflict".
 
     Any existing cases which have a REASON FOR NO RADIATION value of 8 will
     have the corresponding DATE RADIATION STARTED value changed to 88/88/8888.
 
 15) CHEMOTHERAPY              (#165.5,53.2)
     HORMONE THERAPY           (#165.5,54.2)
     IMMUMOTHERAPY             (#165.5,55.2)
     HEMA TRANS/ENDOCRINE PROC (#165.5,153)
     
     If a value of 88 (Recommended, unknown if admin) is entered for any of the
     above systemic therapies, their corresponding therapy date will be stuffed
     with 88/88/8888.
 
     Any existing cases which have a systemic therapy value of 88 will have the
     corresponding therapy date value changed to 88/88/8888.
 
 16) FOLLOW-UP FORM LETTER (#165.1)
     Last 4 digits of SSN
 
     Per HIPAA security regulations, all FOLLOW-UP FORM LETTERs will now display
     only the last 4 digits of the SSN.  Any existing letters will have their
     SSN values converted.  Any future locally created letters should use the
     syntax |$E(SSN,8,11)| for displaying SSN values.
 
 17) SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ... [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]
       PT Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (PTF)]
 
     PTF casefinding has been modified to include a search for ICD-9 code
     285.0 (SIDEROBLASTIC ANEMIA).
 
     Also, the list of ICD-9 codes to be searched for included code V77.1
     (SCREENING FOR DIABETES MELLITUS).  This was incorrect.  The correct
     code listing should be V71.1 (OBSV-SUSPCT MAL NEOPLASM).  This has been
     fixed.
 
 18) NAACCR item: ICD Revision Comorbid [3165] 737-737
 
     For 2006+ cases which have no reportable comorbidities or complications
     the NAACCR item "ICD Revision Comorbid" was being extracted with a value
     of <BLANK>.  This was generating the following EDITS error:
 
     ICD Revision Comorbid, Date of DX (COC)
     E: If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2005, then ICD Revision Comorbid
     E: cannot be blank
 
     This has been fixed.  All cases which have no reportable comorbidities or
     complications will now get an "ICD Revision Comorbid" value of 0 (No 
     secondary diagnosis reported).
  
     NOTE: Due to privacy restrictions, not all comorbidities and complications
     are "reportable" to external institutions (e.g. state registries, NCDB).
     For this reason some cases which have comorbidities and complications
     recorded in VistA may receive an "ICD Revision Comorbid" value of 0 (No
     secondary diagnosis reported).
 
 19) NAACCR item: Vendor Name [1270] 1204-1202
 
     In order to differentiate between the VACCR and STATE extracts the NAACCR
     item "Vendor Name" has been enhanced to include a suffix identifier.  The
     "Vendor Name" value for the VACCR extract will now have a suffix of "A"
     (e.g. VAV11P46A).  The "Vendor Name" value for the STATE extract will now
     have a suffix of "B" (e.g. VAV11P46B).  The NCDB extract will have no
     suffix identifier.                                             
 
 20) Site-Specific Surgery Codes
     Spleen C42.2
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F)      (165.5,58.6)
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F) (165.5,58.7)
 
     The selectable surgery codes for SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) and SURGERY OF
     PRIMARY @FAC (F) for spleen cases were ROADS codes.  They are now the
     correct FORDS codes.
 
     Spleen cases with a SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) or SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F)
     value of 10 (Local excision, destruction, NOS) will have this value 
     converted to 19 (Local tumor destruction or excision, NOS). 
 
     Spleen cases with a SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) or SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC (F)
     value of 20 (Splenectomy, NOS (spleen primary only)) will have this value 
     converted to 80 (Splenectomy, NOS). 
 
 21) FOLLOW-UP RATE FOR ALL PATIENTS (LIVING AND DEAD)
     [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
       [RS Registry Summary Reports]
         [F Follow-Up]
 
     There was a typo in line (F) of the follow-up rate report.  The text read
     "(** should be 90%)".  This was incorrect.  It should read "(** should be
     80%)".  This has been fixed.
 
 22) PROHIBITING FUTURE DATES
 
     Patch ONC*2.11*44 included several new date fields.  These fields
     were allowing the entry of future dates.  This was incorrect.  Future
     dates are now prohibited for the following data items:
 
     DATE OF FIRST SYMPTOMS         (#165.5,171)
     DATE START OF WORKUP ORDERED   (#165.5,172)
     DATE WORKUP STARTED            (#165.5,173)
     DATE OF BLOOD IN SPUTUM PER PT (#165.5,174.1)
     DATE OF CHEST X-RAY            (#165.5,175.1)
     DATE OF CT SCAN                (#165.5,176.1)
     DATE OF BRONCHOSCOPY           (#165.5,177.1)
     DATE OF MEDIASTINOSCOPY        (#165.5,178.1)
     DATE OF PET SCAN               (#165.5,179.1)
     DATE OF CHANGE IN BOWEL HABITS (#165.5,180.1)
     DATE OF FOBT                   (#165.5,181.1)
     DATE OF BARIUM ENEMA           (#165.5,182.1)
     DATE OF SIGMOIDOSCOPY          (#165.5,183.1)
     DATE OF CT OF ABDOMEN/PELVIS   (#165.5,184.1)
     DATE OF COLONOSCOPY            (#165.5,185.1)
     DATE OF DYSPNEA                (#165.5,186.1)
     DATE OF INCREASED COUGH        (#165.5,187.1)
     DATE OF FEVER                  (#165.5,188.1)
     DATE OF NIGHT SWEATS           (#165.5,189.1)
 
 23) COLLABORATIVE STAGING VERSION 01.03.00
     CS Restage CS cases using latest version [ONCO UTIL-CS RESTAGING]
 
     A new option has been added the [UTL *..Utility Options ...] menu:
   
     [CS Restage CS cases using latest version]
 
     This option will search for 2004+ cases which have been previously
     staged with an earlier version of the CS algorithm and restage them
     using CS Version 01.03.00.
 
     Cases which encounter CS errors or warnings during restaging will
     display an error message identifying the problem case by PID, PRIMARY
     SITE and ACCESSION/SEQUENCE NUMBER.
   
     e.g. B0036  C32.1  200600004/02 encountered a CS warning
 
     These cases should be reviewed and restaged manually.
 
 24) SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ... [ONCO SUSPENSE MENU]      
       RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (RAD)]
 
     The RADIOLOGY CASEFINDING LIST report header was displaying the "site"
     name.  It has been changed to display the DIVISION name.
 
 25) NASAL CAVITY (C30.0) and SINUS, ETHMOID (C31.1)
     CLINICAL T (#165.5,37.1)
 
     For 6th Edition NASAL CAVITY and SINUS,ETHMOID cases code 88 (NA) was not
     available for CLINICAL T selection.  This has been fixed.
 
 26) PLASMA CELL DISORDERS
     BONE MARROW C42.1
     MULTIPLE MYELOMA 9732/3
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F)      (#165.5,138.4)
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC (F) (#165.5,138.5)
 
     For a "no treatment" BONE MARROW (C42.1) case with an histology of MULTIPLE
     MYELOMA (9732/3), SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) and SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC were
     being stuffed with code 0 (None).  This was incorrect.  The correct code is
     9 (Unknown/NA).  This has been fixed.
 
     Any existing cases which meet this criteria will have their SCOPE OF LN
     SURGERY and SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC values converted to 9.
