Subject: COST REPORT BY NAOU,TRANSFER OF WHOLE AND DECIMAL QUANTITIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the issues reported in:
 1) HD67471 - DUB-0402-30756 Cost Report
 This patch will send a meaningful message, regarding the Cost Report by 
 NAOU(S) [PSD COST REPORTS], when either the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT (field
 #16) of the DRUG file (#50) or the quantity recorded for the transaction 
 is zero.
  
 2) HD148061 - PSD NAOU Balance Report
 It also saves some real estate by sending the "Give me a second or two to 
 alphabetize" message, in PSD NAOU BALANCE REPORT, to the screen instead 
 of the printer.
  
 3) HD139215 - Transfer GS option only allows whole number quantities.
 Allow decimal values for the quantity to transfer field.

 ============================
 HD0000000067471 - DUB-0402-30756 Cost Report
 HD0000000148061 - PSD NAOU Balance Report
 HD0000000139215 - Transfer GS option only allows whole number quantities
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 =============================
 1)HD0000000067471 - DUB-0402-30756 Cost Report
  
    Problem
    -------
    When executing the option Controlled Substances Cost Report by NAOU(s) 
    a message is generated when either the Price per Dispense Unit or the
    Quantity recorded for the transaction is zero.  However. the report
    does not contain any data.  Only a header is displayed.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified the PSDCOSM routine to capture the corresponding data (Drug
    Name, Date/Time, Transaction Number, Price Per Dispense Unit, 
    Quantity).
  
 2)HD0000000148061 - PSD NAOU Balance report
  
    Problem
    -------
    When this report is sent to the printer, it prints "Give me a second
    or two to alphabetize" on a single sheet of paper and then prints the
    report.  This is a waste of paper.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified the PSDBAN routine to print the message to the screen.
  
    *** NOTE **************************************************************
    ** Please remember that, as far as the system is concerned, there is *
    ** no difference between a SLAVE printer and your current input device*
    ** (i.e. device zero).  Therefore, a report sent to a SLAVE printer,  *
    ** Will still have the "Give me..." message printed on the hardcopy.  *
    ***********************************************************************
  
  
  
 3)HD0000000139215 - Transfer GS option
  
    Problem
    -------
    The quantity to transfer field only accepts whole numbers.  This is
    not only inconsistent with other quantity values on the complete green
    sheet option but also impractical.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Allow decimals values by modifying PSDNTF routine.
