Description:
============

  
 1.  Problem: NOIS AAA-0303-N1449
     The "Last Action" column on the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) 
     Virtual Due List (VDL) displays inaccurate information via a sequence of 
     administrative actions upon two distinct orders having the same orderable 
     item.
  
     Corrective Action:
     The "Last Action" column on the BCMA VDL will display appropriate and 
     accurate status, date and time information per orderable item.
  
  
 2.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0503-30409
     After a medication patch order is "Given," if that order expires or is 
     discontinued, and the patient has no other active orders, the patch 
     order does not display on the VDL; the message "No Active Orders"
     displays instead.
  
     Corrective Action:
     If a patch is "Given" and not "Removed," it should display on the VDL 
     until it is marked as "Removed." A patch with the status of "Given" will
     display on the VDL until it is marked as "Removed."
  
  
 3.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0503-30409
     After a large volume IV order is "Infusing," if that order expires or is 
     discontinued and the patient has no other active orders, the infusing IV 
     does not always display on the VDL; the message "No Active Orders" 
     displays instead. 
  
     Corrective Action:
     If an IV is "Infusing" and not "Completed," it should display on the VDL 
     up to 7 days after the order is expired/discontinued or until the order 
     is marked as "Completed." An IV that is "Infusing" will display on the VDL 
     for 7 days after the order is expired/discontinued or until it is marked 
     as "Completed."
  
  
 4.  Problem: NOIS HAM-0103-22522, HUN-0403-21086
     The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option does not allow the user 
     to change the status of a medication patch from "Given" to "Removed."  An 
     attempt to change the status from "Given" to "Removed" using the Edit 
     Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option displays the message "Allowed 
     status codes are Given, Not Given, Held, and Refused," preventing the 
     status change of the medication patch.  
  
     Corrective Action:
     The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option will allow the 
     status of a "Given" medication patch to be changed to "Removed."
  
  
 5.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30098
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option allows the 
     user to enter any administration status for any order type. For
     example, the user can create a new BCMA Medication Log entry for a 
     medication patch order, with an administration status of "Completed." 
  
     Corrective Action:
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option will only 
     allow the user to enter "Given," "Held," or "Refused" for orders which 
     are not IV orders. A status for an IV order will not be allowed since 
     IV medications cannot be entered via this menu option.
  
  
 6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30653
     The "Schedule:" prompt in the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
     ENTRY] option screen displays the schedule type instead of the schedule.
  
     Corrective Action:
     The "Schedule:" prompt in the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG 
     NEW ENTRY] option screen will display the schedule.
  
  
 7.  Problem: NOIS CLL-0303-40554
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option allows the user 
     to enter a future date and time for a medication administration, which 
     sometimes causes inaccurate information on BCMA reports.
  
     Corrective Action:
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option will not allow 
     the user to enter a future date and time for a medication administration.
