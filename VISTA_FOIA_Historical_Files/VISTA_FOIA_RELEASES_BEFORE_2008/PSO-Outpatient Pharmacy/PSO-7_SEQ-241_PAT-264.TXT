Description:
============

 The FY07 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following PSO enhancements:
  
 1. Internet Refill Automation and Reporting
    a. Internet Refill Automation Job
       Added a new Automate Internet Refill [PSO AUTO REFILL INITIALIZE] 
       option to the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE]
       menu that allows the sites to schedule/un-schedule a background job
       to automatically process refill requests placed via the Internet. It
       requires the PSOAUTRF key and generates MailMan messages by division
       to holders of the PSOAUTRF key with details of Not-Filled refills,
       unsuccessful runs, count of refills processed successfully, etc.
  
       Note: The new PSOAUTRF security key is transported in this patch and
             should be assigned to the appropriate personnel to setup the
             above job.
  
  
       Example: If the patient is marked as dead, the following message is
                generated:
  
       Subj: ALBANY Internet Refills Not Processed List,  [#104161] 
       08/10/07@09:12 11 lines
       From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
       ------------------------------------------------------------------
       Internet Refills Not Processed Report for the ALBANY Division.
  
       The following refill requests were not processed:
  
       Patient: OPPATIENT,SEVEN   SSN: 0000
  
       Rx #: 100002461  (REF #1)  Qty: 2
       Drug: ASPIRIN 650MG SUPPOSITORIES
       Reason: Patient Died on AUG 10, 2007
  
  
    b. Added two new fields, PROCESS AUTO REFILLS FOR INPAT field (#2030)
       and PROCESS AUTO REFILLS FOR CNH field (#2035), to the OUTPATIENT
       SITE file (#59) to allow the sites to process/not to process refills
       for inpatients and CNH patients for the scheduled job defined in
       item 1.a above. It will process these refills only if the site has
       flagged these fields as YES.
    
       The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option is also
       modified to include these two new fields.
  
    c. Added two additional fields to the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file
       (#52.43). They are as follows:
       REMARKS field (#10) - to capture the refill number and suspended 
                             date if the refill was processed or the reason
                             why it was not processed.
       LOGIN DATE field (#11) - to capture the date and time the refill 
                                request was made.
  
    d. Added a new Internet Refill Report [PSO INTERNET REFILL REPORT]
       option, to the Output Reports [PSO OUTPUTS] menu that generates
       reports by division, detail, or summary of internet refills sorted
       by Patient, Date, or Result.
  
       Note:
       The report will only provide information on Internet Refills from
       the date the patch is installed.  If the report is run to include
       dates prior to the patch installation no information will be
       included on the report for those dates.
  
  
 2. Modified the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] and
    Process Internet Refills [PSO INTERNET REFILLS] options to provide
    separate prompts to Allow refills for inpatient and Allow refills for
    Contract Nursing Home (CNH) instead of a single prompt that applies to
    both.
  
 3. If the REGISTRATION package V. 5.3 patch DG*5.3*688 that introduces the
    COUNTRY field to the PATIENT file (#2) is installed, then for Local
    Mail-outs with foreign addresses, the address information on the laser
    label mailing label is replaced with *** FOREIGN ADDRESS ***.
   
 4. Added a new Queue CMOP Prescription [PSO RX QUEUE CMOP] option to the
    Suspense Functions [PSO PND] menu, Pharmacist Menu [PSO USER1] and
    Pharmacy Technician's Menu [PSO USER2] menu, to manually queue
    prescription to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP).
  
 5. The software is modified to check if the Provider has a DEA number in 
    the DEA# field (#53.2) or a VA number in the VA# field (#53.3) of the
    NEW PERSON file (#200) and the YSCL AUTHORIZED key to order clozapine
    drug. Previously, the check was only for the DEA#. If the ordering
    provider does not have the DEA# or the VA#, the order cannot be placed
    and user will see the message 'Provider must have a DEA# or VA# to
    write prescriptions for clozapine'. Also, if the provider does not hold
    the YSCL AUTHORIZED key, the message 'Provider must hold YSCL
    AUTHORIZED key to write prescriptions for clozapine' is displayed.
  
    Note: The YSCL AUTHORIZED key was transported in the MENTAL HEALTH V. 
          5.01 patch YS*5.01*90 and should be assigned to the appropriate
          provider to write prescriptions for clozapine.
  
 6. The View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option is modified to display
    the NPI field (#41.99) of the NEW PERSON file (#200).
  
 7. Changes to the Patient Information (Profile) Screen
  a. The PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is
     added to the Patient Information screen. It will be displayed after
     the patient's eligibility.
     
     Example:
  
     Patient Information        Aug 10, 2007@10:04:09       Page: 1 of 2

     DD  Detailed Allergy/ADR List           EX  Exit Patient List
     Select Action: Next Screen//
  
  b. Change the existing 'PHONE:' label to 'HOME PHONE:', and also display
     the PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] field (#.134) and the PHONE NUMBER [WORK]
     field (#.132) of the PATIENT file (#2). The work and cell phone
     fields can be maintained via the PATIENT UPDATE (PU) action and the
     Update Patient Record [PSO PAT] option.
  
 8. Added a new hidden ListMan 'CM' action to the Medication Profile called
    Manual Queue to CMOP [PSO LM QUEUE TO CMOP] to the PSO HIDDEN ACTIONS 
    #2 PROTOCOL, to manually queue selected prescriptions to CMOP.
  
 9. Added a new column showing the B/D/F (Bad Address Indicator/ Do Not 
    Mail/ Foreign Address) to the Log of Suspended Rx's by Day (this
    Division) [PSO PNDLOG] option.
  
 10. Modified Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI SUSPENDED] option to 
     include the prompt either B/D/F or 'ALL' in the unprinted suspended
     prescriptions report.
  
  
 MISCELLANEOUS FIXES:
 -------------------
  
 1. With the release of PSO*7*260, a line of code was missing from the 
    View Prescription [PSO VIEW] option that displays Dosage, Verb,
    Dispense Unit, Noun, Route, and Schedule. This patch restores this
    functionality.
  
 2. The field description of the REFILL INACTIVE DRUG RXS field (#.111) of
    the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) has a typo. It is corrected to
    'prescription'.
