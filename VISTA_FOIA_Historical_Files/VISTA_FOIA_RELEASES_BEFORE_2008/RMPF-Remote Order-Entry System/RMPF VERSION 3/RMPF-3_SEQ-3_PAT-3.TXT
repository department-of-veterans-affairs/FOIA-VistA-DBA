Description:
============

 Installation of RMPF*3*2 is not required. RMPF*3*3 is a patch to replace
 patch RMPF*3*2. Patch RMPF*3*2 was mistakenly created using routines from
 RMPF*3*0 instead of from RMPF*3*1. This led to a removal of PG4 from the
 eligibility selection list and a return of an obsolete copy/paste
 mechanism. This was evidenced by a pop-up at the end of the ROES session
 referencing the 'Copy to Clipboard' button within ROES. It also caused the
 ROES3 icon to remain minimized on the task bar until after the ROES web
 application ended.
  
 RMPF*3*2 and RMPF*3*3 are both related to a VACO administrative action 
 changing the name of the former Denver Distribution Center (DDC), now 
 called the Denver Acquisition & Logistics Center (DALC).  In accordance 
 with VA naming conventions, the DDC abbreviation appears in various 
 internal IT system names, including the VA domain name system (DNS). The 
 VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package references the DNS system 
 for name resolution in establishing sessions to the ROES web application 
 which is hosted at the DALC. 
  
 This patch modifies the two ROES executables (ROES3.exe and 
 ROES3DeskTop.exe) to reference the new DNS name and corrects the 
 unintended changes re-introduced in RMPF*3*2.  The new executables must 
 be installed at all Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) 
 implementations of the ROES package.
  
  
 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 =========================
  
  1. HD192283   PG4 not appearing on selectable eligibilities list.
  
  Problem:
  
    After the installation of RMPF*3*2, when entering from CPRS for a
 patient who is not automatically eligible, the list of possible
 eligibilities did not include PG4. It should have been below priority
 group 8 at the bottom of the list.
  
  Resolution:
  
    Some routines from patch RMPF*3*0 were incorporated into RMPF*3*2 
 instead of the routines from RMPF*3*1 and that caused the problem. The 
 domain name changes have now been made to the correct routines from 
 RMPF*3*1 to resolve the issue.

 The files listed above should be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method 
 is to FTP the files from:
  
   download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
   CIO Field Office      FTP Address               Directory
   Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  [anonymous.software]
   Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   [anonymous.software]

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
 Two executable files from the RMPF3_0P3.ZIP should be copied over the
 corresponding existing files according to each site's implementation of 
 ROES (depending on station-specific implementation strategy, the 
 executables may be located either on a shared network drive and/or on 
 each client workstation).  No further action by local IRM Services is 
 necessary.
