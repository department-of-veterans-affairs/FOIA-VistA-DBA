  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  HD180282 - QAN package problem;wrong patient id
    
  Problem:
  ========
  PATIENT ID FIELD(#.02) stored in the QA PATIENT INCIDENT REVIEW
  FILE(#742) is displayed incorrectly if patient's last name contains a
  space. The ID should be made up of the first initials of first name,
  middle, last name and the last four of the patients social security
  number. If the last name has a space, the letter after the space was
  showing in the PATIENT ID instead. This is because the code does not take
  into account the space in the patient's last name when populating the
  field.
        
  Solution:
  =========
  Code has been changed to allow for spaces in the last name and store the
  PATIENT ID correctly using first initials of first name, middle, last
  name and the last four of the patients social security number.
