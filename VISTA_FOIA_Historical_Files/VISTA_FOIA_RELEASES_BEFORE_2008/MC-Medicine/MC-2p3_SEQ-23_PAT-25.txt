Description: 
============

 This patch makes the following changes to the Medicine PFT module.
  
   1) The DLCO-SB field (#19) in the PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS file
      (#700) has been modified to accept two decimal places, previously
      it only allowed one.  The maximum upper limit to the field has been
      increased from 99.9 to 99.99.  The help prompt has been changed
      accordingly.
  
   2) The HEIGHT (INCHES.TENTHS) field (#3) in the PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS
      file (#700) has been modified to accept two decimal places,
      previously it only allowed one.  The help prompt has been changed
      accordingly.
  
   3) Two new fields have been added to the PFT PREDICTED VALUES file
      (#700.1):
        13.01  MVV CORR.-BLACK   
        13.02  MVV CORR.-ORIENTAL
      These fields point to the PFT FORMULA file (#700.2) and are used
      to specify the formulas to be used to perform the race correction
      on the Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) value.  In order to use
      the MVV race correction, sites will need to edit these fields and
      point them to a valid MVV race correction formula.  These fields
      may be edited via the Associate Predicted Value Formulas
      [MCPFTPVFASS] option.
  
   4) The TYPE field (#1) in the PFT FORMULA file (#700.2) has been
      lengthened from 30 to 35 characters.  The help prompt has been
      changed accordingly.
  
   5) The formulas in the PFT FORMULA file (#700.2) may now reference
      additional height and weight variables, see below.
        HT   - Height in centimeters     WT   - Weight in kilograms
        HTCM - Height in centimeters     WTKG - Weight in kilograms
        HTIN - Height in inches          WTLB - Weight in pounds
  
   6) The PFT Report [MCFPPFT] option now prints "Corr DLCO for HB & COHB"
      values.  This line replaces the "Corrected DLCO for HB" and
      "Corrected DLCO for COHB" lines in the report.
  
   7) The PFT Report [MCFPPFT] and Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT] options now
      print race corrected MVV values if all of the following are true:
        a) There is a MVV race correction formula entered in field 13.01
           or 13.02 (see item #2 above).
        b) The USE RACE CORRECTIONS field (#38) in the PULMONARY FUNCTION
           TESTS file (#700) is set to YES.
        c) The patient's race (as returned by DEM^VADPT) contains the
           string "BLACK" or "ASIAN".
  
   8) The PFT Report [MCFPPFT] and Brief PFT Report [MCBPPFT] options now
      print the formulas used to perform the race correction on the MVV
      value.
  
   9) Under some circumstances (HB<11) the correction for the DLCO value
      was not being calculated; this has been fixed.
  
  10) All of the PFT enter/edit options (see below) will now display an
      informational message if the patient's race (as returned by
      DEM^VADPT) is null.

  less than 5 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
      load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in
      the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be
      removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
      select the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From the Install menu, you may elect to use the following
      options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MC*2.3*25):
  
       a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       b.  Print Transport Global
       c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
       d.  Backup a Transport Global
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      MC*2.3*25.
  
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
      install? YES//", respond "NO".  When prompted "Want to
      DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
      YES//", respond "YES" and enter the options listed under
      the "Options Affected" section.
  
  7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they 
      should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
      has run to completion.
