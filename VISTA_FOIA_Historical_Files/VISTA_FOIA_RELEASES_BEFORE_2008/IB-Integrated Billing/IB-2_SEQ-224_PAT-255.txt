Subject: FIX RX COPAY EXEMPTION FOR IVM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released as EMERGENCY to prevent additional incorrect 
 calculations of Rx Copay Exemptions.
  
 The upload of an IVM Converted Means Test (ORU~Z06) uses the same 
 functionality as used in the upload of a Means Test for an INCOME TEST 
 DATA (ORU~Z10) Transmission.  All uploaded Means Tests re-calculate the 
 COPAY INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS (#.04) field in the BILLING PATIENT (#354) 
 File.
  
 The HL7 message for an IVM Converted Means Test contains no financial 
 information.  This causes the COPAY INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS to always be 
 set to EXEMPT which is not always correct.
  
 This patch modifies the software so that the upload of an IVM Converted 
 Means Test (ORU~Z06) no longer triggers a re-calculation of the COPAY 
 INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS field in the BILLING PATIENT (#354) File.
  
 The COPAY INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS calculation will be blocked on the 
 processing of an ORU~Z06 HL7 Transmission only.
  
 A subsequent patch (EAS*1.0*42 - Fix RX Copay Upload for IVM) will 
 address the upload of an IVM Converted RX Co-Pay Test, where the updates 
 to the RX COPAY CURRENT INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS field will be correctly 
 handled.
  
 NOTE:  When used, the PRINT/VERIFY PATIENT EXEMPTION STATUS [IB RX PRINT 
 VERIFY EXEMP] option will still re-calculate an exemption incorrectly and 
 Update the BILLING PATIENT file with the incorrect status for veterans 
 whose Means Test has been converted by IVM.  Patch IB*2.0*262 is under 
 development to modify that option so that it will exclude IVM converted 
 means tests when re-calculating exemptions.
