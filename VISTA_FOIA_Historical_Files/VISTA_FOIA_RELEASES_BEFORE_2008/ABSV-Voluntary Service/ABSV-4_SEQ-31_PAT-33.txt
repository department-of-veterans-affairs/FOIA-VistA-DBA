Subject: Update to Migration patch 31

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description: 
============

  
 This patch is part of the migration from the VistA-based Voluntary
 TimeKeeping package to the web-based Voluntary Service System (VSS).
 It is a patch for ABSV*4.0*31.  It will add the missing Service Codes,
 170A and 270A-E.  It also excludes data from any Game site; stations
 700, 701, 702,and 575W.  For consolidated stations, the user will be
 prompted to send or not send data for each site.  This will allow them 
 to exclude Voluntary Time Keeping data for old site numbers. 
 
  
 This patch installs routines, other components, and file 503339.5
 VOLUNTARY MIGRATION LOG. These are all updates, originally installed
 with patch ABSV*4.0*31, and will allow the site to check existing
 VTK data, and to print error reports of the data validation.
 
 After installing this patch, you need to re-run the 'Prepare for Transition
  to VSS' option under the 'Voluntary Data Migration Menu'.
  
 A companion patch, ABSV*4.0*32, contains the option that sends the data to
 the new system.
