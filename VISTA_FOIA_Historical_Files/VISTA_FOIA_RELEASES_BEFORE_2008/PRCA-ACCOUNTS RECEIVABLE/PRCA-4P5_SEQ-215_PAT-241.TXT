Description:
============

 This patch is the last in a series of patches that adjusts the accounts
 of veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina.  This patch has been released
 in conjunction with Integrated Billing patch IB*2*340.  Patch IB*2*340
 must be installed before this patch.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to support the VHA Chief Business Office
 (CBO) request to automatically cancel all veteran co-payments, charged
 to veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina, for treatment provided from
 8/29/05 through 2/28/06.  This action has been approved by the Office 
 of the Under Secretary for Health.  Upon installation, this patch will 
 queue a post initialization process, to be executed immediately, that 
 provides two pieces of functionality:
  
 1. Exemption of Interest Charges Added Between 8/29/05 and 4/30/06
  
    The post initialization will exempt interest and administrative
    charges that have been added between 8/29/05 and 4/30/06, for
    veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Most of these charges
    were exempted by patch PRCA*4.5*237.  However, some interest
    charges were not exempted, such as in cases where a veteran made
    a payment that eliminated the interest balance on the applicable
    receivable.  This process will credit the veteran for any interest
    charges that were not exempted with patch PRCA*4.5*237, by
    exempting the corresponding receivable, reducing the veteran's
    other open or active receivables, or creating a pre-payment.
    Note that suspended receivables will not be reduced.
  
 2. Cancelling Co-payments for Treatment Provide Between 8/29/05
    and 2/28/06
  
    Veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina, who were billed co-payment
    charges for treatment provided from 8/29/05 to 2/28/06, will be
    excused from payment of those charges.  These charges will be
    cancelled in Accounts Receivable, but not in Integrated Billing,
    so veterans' medication co-payment maximum annual billing caps
    and Means Test billing clocks will not be adjusted.
  
    The post initialization process will invoke the software installed
    with patch IB*2*340 to identify the co-payment charges that need
    to be cancelled.  The Integrated Billing software will in turn invoke
    Accounts Receivable to decrease the receivable associated with the
    charge, decrease any other open or active receivable if necessary,
    or create a pre-payment for the veteran if necessary.  Note
    that suspended receivables will not be decreased.  A more
    detailed description of this processing may be found in the
    IB*2*340 patch description.
  
 Upon completion of this process, a bulletin with the subject
 "Job Completion - PRCA*4.5*241 Post Initialization" will be sent
 to the members of the PRCA ADJUSTMENT TRANS mail group with the
 following statistics:
  
  -  Number of Veterans with Interest Exempted
  -  Total Amount of Interest Exempted
  -  Number of Veterans with Charges Cancelled
  -  Total Amount of Charges Cancelled
  -  Total Amount of Held Charges Cancelled
  
     ** Please Note: Each site should forward this bulletin to their
                     VISN Business Implementation Manager, who will
                     compile the results and send them to Josie
                     Boisvert of the Chief Business Office.
  
 This patch also modifies the following options by displaying an
 indicator if a veteran was affected by Hurricane Katrina:
  
  o  Profile of Accounts Receivable [PRCAC PROFILE]
  o  Account Profile [RCDP ACCOUNT PROFILE]
  o  Bill Profile [RCDP BILL PROFILE]
  
 
 ************************* SPECIAL NOTES *************************
 
 In about 1% cases, there is an over-crediting that occurs because some 
 sites have already written-off bills that would have had been canceled 
 by this patch. If your site suspects that some over-crediting due to these
 write-offs has occurred, PLEASE enter a Remedy ticket for EVS assistance.  
 The issue was discussed with the Chief Business Office (CBO), and they 
 concurred with releasing the software.
 
 Additionally, when a Hurricane Katrina affected veteran has a suspended
 bill and is eligible for exemptions, the software creates a pre-payment
 for the amount of the charges to be exempted.  This works in accordance
 with current Accounts Receivable functionality, which does not touch
 suspended bills.  This issue was discussed with CBO, and they agree that
 the Accounts Receivable functionality should not be changed.
 
 CBO will be sending out a message to all sites soon providing further
 information related to these notes and the Hurricane Katrina project.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
 Upon installation, this patch will queue a post implementation job
 to run immediately.  This job will exempt interest charges and cancel
 co-payment charges, as described above.  This queued job may run from
 30-60 minutes, depending upon the number of veterans flagged with
 the Hurricane Katrina indicator at your facility.  When the job is
 completed, a mail message will be sent to the users of the PRCA
 ADJUSTMENT TRANS mail group, as well as the installer of the patch.
 It is preferable if the patch is installed after normal business
 hours, but it can be installed during the day when Accounts
 Receivable users are on-line.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following options in the OPTION (#19) file be disabled:
  
 Profile of Accounts Receivable [PRCAC PROFILE]
 Account Profile [RCDP ACCOUNT PROFILE]
 Bill Profile [RCDP BILL PROFILE]
  
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes, since the post initialization
 only queues a job to run.
