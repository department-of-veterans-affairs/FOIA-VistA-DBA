 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
   1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2*10.
   
       >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
       If you have installed LEX*2*10 into another account, and the 
       Lexicon global ^LEX is translated into the current account,
       you may go directly to step 5 of the installation instructions.
  
       It is not necessary to install the data more than once per 
       translation.
                                                                       
       >>>>>>>  IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<
   
   2)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global does
       not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM exist, you 
       will need to kill this global before proceeding.
    
       To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
    
         DSM    
    
           K ^LEXM
    
         Open M
    
           The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system wide 
           setting, but can be allowed for a particular process using the
           $ZU command.  The command for enabling unsubscripted global 
           kills is:
    
             VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
             VAH>K ^LEXM
    
           The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process is 
           S X=$ZU(68,28,1), however, halting out of the process and 
           creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
    
   3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX2_P10.GBL.  This 
       file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
   
         DSM
    
           Use ^%GTI and the input device LEX2_P10.GBL
    
         Open M
    
           We recommend that the GUI Thin Client be used to restore the
           global.  Be sure to select the VAH namespace in the "Global 
           Utilities" window.  Make sure that you select the global host
           file LEX2_P10.GBL (File / Open) before changing the file 
           format.  With the namespace and file selected, change the 
           restore file format to VAX DSM.
    
           Using the GUI utilities will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> error when
           restoring a global saved under DSM  (usually seen when using 
           the CHUI %GI utility to restore a DSM global).
    
       The loading of the global should take from 1 to 2 minutes.
   
   4)  Turn journaling off for globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM.
    
         DSM
     
           Use ^%GLOMAN
           For the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
           Select "Change Journaling Capabilities"
           Select "D" for "Disabled"
    
         Open M
    
           We recommend using the GUI System Operations Utilities.  Select
           the database where the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM reside 
           using the Databases tab (to find out where a global resides use
           the GUI global utility directory tab).  Then select the menu 
           item Action / Database / Global attributes.  In the Attributes
           and Journaling window, click on the "Globals" button.  Select 
           the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM (note the "All Globals" check
           box needs to be unmarked to select a specific global).  Make sure
           the check box under the column heading "Journal" is unmarked for
           the ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM globals and then click "OK."
    
   5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
   
   6)  Distribution Load:
   
       Load the Distribution from the Packman Message using the Packman 
       function "Install/Check Message."
   
         Environment Check:  
    
           Only package components and system variables will be checked 
           during the loading of the transport global.
   
   7)  KIDS Installation:
   
       Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action "Install
       Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*10.  The KIDS installation
       should take from 3.25 to 5.5 minutes (with journaling off) depending
       on the number of users/jobs on the system.
   
         Environment Check:  
    
           LEX*2*10 data exist (by global translation):
  
             If the data for LEX*2*10 has been installed and is translated
             into the current account, then only package components and 
             system variables will be checked.
  
           LEX*2*10 data does not exist:
  
             If the data for LEX*2*10 can not be found (either in the 
             current account or by translation) then the environment check
             routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build namespace
             and global checksum.  This is to insure that the correct 
             import global is loaded and that all of the data contained in
             the import global arrived at your site during the FTP 
             transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the wrong import
             global or the global fails the checksum, the install will 
             stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP another copy of
             the import global (see the section on FTP Software Retrieval
             and step 3 of the Installation Instructions).
             
       Disable Options:
   
         Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu 
         Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
   
   8)  Cleanup
   
       a)  Kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
    
           After the installation of this patch the you will need to kill 
           the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent import global
           checksum errors on future installations.  (see step 2 for 
           "unsubscripted" kills)
    
       b)  If journaling was turned off in step 4 for the ^LEX and ^LEXT 
           globals, turn journaling back on.
    
           DSM
    
             Same instructions as in step 4 except select "E" for "Enabled"
    
           Open M
    
             Same instructions as in step 4 except make sure the check 
             box under the column heading "Journal" is marked for the 
             ^LEX and ^LEXT globals.
 
       c)  Purge all routines in the LEX2* namespace (these are v 2.0's 
           environment check and post-install routines).
