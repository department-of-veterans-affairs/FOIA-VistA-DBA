Description: 
============

  This patch enhances the Procedures module of Consult/Request Tracking.
  There are two major enhancements included.
   
  1) A complete change to the method of creating and activating procedures
     for use in CPRS and Consult/Request Tracking is introduced including a
     new file to store the procedures data.
  2) The ability to link results stored in the VistA Medicine package to a
     Consult request has been re-established.
   
   
  PROCEDURE SETUP:
  ================
   
  The GMRC PROCEDURES (#123.3) file should NOT be edited via VA FileMan.
  The interface between CPRS and Consult/Request Tracking depends on the
  use of the Setup procedures [GMRC PROCEDURE SETUP] option.
   
  The following is the process used to add new procedures or modify
  existing procedures.
   
  Select Consult Management Option:  Setup procedures
  Select Procedure:   ELECTROCARDIOGRAM
  NAME: ELECTROCARDIOGRAM// <enter>
  INACTIVE: ??
       The INACTIVE field, if set to YES causes a procedure to no longer be
       selectable when ordering within CPRS.  Existing requests for this
       procedure may be processed to completion even if the procedure is
       inactive.
       Choose from: 
         1        YES
         0        NO
  INACTIVE: 
  Select SYNONYM: EKG// ??
   
  Choose from:
     ECG   
     EKG   
      
  Select SYNONYM: EKG// <enter>
  Select RELATED SERVICES: MEDICINE,SOUTH// ??
  
  Choose from:   CARDIOLOGY   
                 MEDICINE,SOUTH   
      
       This field will indicate which Consult services from the REQUEST
       SERVICES (#123.5) file are responsible for the processing of
       requests for this procedure.
   
  Choose from:
     ALL SERVICES   
     ARTHRITIS   
     CARDIOLOGY   
     CARDIOLOGY (SOUTH)   
     CONTACT LENS REQUEST   
   
  Select RELATED SERVICES: MEDICINE,SOUTH// <enter>
  TYPE OF PROCEDURE: ECG// ??
       This field indicates which type of medicine procedure and thus which
       result file in the Medicine Package will hold results for this
       procedure.
        
       Coordination may be necessary with the Medicine Adpac to determine
       the correct procedure mapping.
        
       If this field is not entered, the procedure may still be resulted
       using a TIU document, but Medicine results may not be linked to
       requests for this procedure.
   
  Choose from:
     A-LEAD IMP        ATRIAL LEAD IMPLANT  
     ABG        ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS  
     ARTH        ARTHROCENTESIS  
     ARTHWC        ARTHROCENTESIS W/STEROID  
   
  TYPE OF PROCEDURE: ECG// <enter>
  
  PREREQUISITE:
   No existing text
   Edit? NO// 
  PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT: ??
         This field will be used by CPRS to determine how to prompt for the
         provisional diagnosis when ordering this procedure. If this field
         is set to OPTIONAL, the user will be prompted for the provisional
         diagnosis but may bypass answering the prompt. If the field is set
         to SUPPRESS, the user will not be presented with the provisional
         diagnosis prompt. If set to REQUIRED, the user must answer the
         prompt to continue placing the order.
    
      Choose from: 
        O        OPTIONAL
        R        REQUIRED
        S        SUPPRESS
  PROVISIONAL DX PROMPT:   
  PROVISIONAL DX INPUT: ??
      This field will determine the method that CPRS will use to prompt the
      user for input of the provisional diagnosis when ordering. If set to
      FREE TEXT, the user may type any text from 2-80 characters in length.
      If set to LEXICON, the user will be required to select a coded 
      diagnosis from the Clinical Lexicon.
    
      Choose from: 
        F        FREE TEXT
        L        LEXICON
  PROVISIONAL DX INPUT: <enter>
  DEFAULT REASON FOR REQUEST:
   No existing text
   Edit? NO// 
  RESTRICT DEFAULT REASON EDIT: ??
     If a DEFAULT REASON FOR REQUEST exists for this procedure this field
     affects the ordering person's ability to edit the default reason while
     placing an order.
        
              0 - UNRESTRICTED
                  User will be able to edit the default text at any time.
          
              1 - ASK ON EDIT ONLY
                  User will only be allowed to edit the default reason if
                  the order is edited before releasing to the service.
          
              2 - NO EDITING
                  User will not be allowed to edit the default reason at
                  any time.
          
     The value of this field will be ignored if no DEFAULT REASON FOR
     REQUEST exists for this procedure.
    
      Choose from: 
        0        UNRESTRICTED
        1        ASK ON EDIT ONLY
        2        NO EDITING
  RESTRICT DEFAULT REASON EDIT:
   
  Orderable Item Updated
   
   
  The TYPE OF PROCEDURE field in the procedure setup essentially turns on
  the interface to the Medicine package for this type of procedure. The
  field is a pointer to the PROCEDURE/SUBSPECIALTY (#697.2) file in the
  Medicine package. If this field is not set, no medicine procedure results
  may be linked to this type of procedure request.
  
  
  LINKING MED RESULTS TO PROCEDURE REQUEST:
  =========================================
  In the Consult Service Tracking option and in CPRS list manager Consults
  tab, medicine results can be associated with the procedure request by
  using the complete/update action. If the selected item is a procedure and
  is configured for medicine resulting, users will be given the option of
  attaching medicine procedure results and/or writing a TIU document.  In
  the CPRS GUI, associating medicine procedure results will be done via a
  separate menu item on the Action Menu of the Consults tab if OR*3*85
  (CPRS GUI v15) is installed.
   
   
  REMOVING MEDICINE RESULTS FROM A REQUEST:
  =========================================
  This patch provides a mechanism to disassociate a medicine result from a
  request that was linked by mistake. The ability to take this action is
  controlled by membership in a USR USER CLASS. A new field is exported for
  the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5). Field (#1.06) RESULT MGMT USER CLASS is a
  pointer to the USR USER CLASS (#8930) file and the appropriate user class
  of individuals who may take this action should be listed here.  It is
  recommended that the user class entered here be in line with the business
  rule involving LINK action as it pertains to TIU documents. This new
  field may be accessed using the Set up Consult Services [GMRC SETUP
  REQUEST SERVICES] option.
   
  The action to disassociate a medicine result is provided through the
  Remove Med Rslt action on the Consult Service Tracking option or the
  Consults tab of CPRS list manager. The action will be available as a menu
  action in the CPRS GUI when OR*3*85 is installed.
  
   
  PRINTING CHANGES:
  =================
  Three printing changes have been made to the SF-513 when printing TIU
  documents attached to a consult record.
  1) If the date/time of the note is different than the time of the note
     entry, the date/time of the note will be printed.
  2) When additional signers are identified for a particular document, they
     will be identified on the form with the heading "Receipt acknowledged
     by: "
  3) If a document has been amended, the date/time of the amendment as well
     as the person making the amendment will be identified on the SF-513.
   
  
  OBSOLETE OPTIONS:
  =================
  Several obsolete options are deleted during the install of this patch.
  The options that will be deleted are:
  
  GMRC MEDICINE PKG INTERFACE  
  GMRC MEDICINE USER           
  GMRC PROTOCOL DETAILED REPORT
  GMRC PROTOCOL LIST           
  GMRC SETUP PROTOCOLS
  
   
  POST-INSTALL:
  =============
  The post-install of this patch includes a significant conversion of data.
  All orderable items in CPRS that are of the procedure type are converted
  from entries in the PROTOCOL (#101) file to the new GMRC PROCEDURE
  (#123.3) file. The GMRC PROCEDURE (#123.3) file is exported with one
  entry named UNKNOWN PROCEDURE. 
  
  Any entry in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file that points to a
  procedure will be changed to point to the new procedure file. Any
  procedure pointer that can not be resolved will be pointed to the
  UNKNOWN PROCEDURE entry.
   
  All procedures entered in the PROCEDURE TYPE field of the REQUEST
  SERVICES (#123.5) file have been converted to the new GMRC PROCEDURES
  (#123.3) file. 
  
  During the conversion a message stating "This service is disabled. Try
  again." may appear in the INSTALL file. This is only an indication that 
  a procedure was linked to a disabled service in the REQUEST SERVICES
  (#123.5) file. This message is not an error, it may be ignored and does
  not affect the data conversion.
   
  Upon completion of the post-install, a mail message will be delivered to
  the installer. The install file will contain a remark as to the message
  number. This message will contain a message indicating any problems
  encountered during the conversion. 
  
  ** IMPORTANT NOTE:
  If this message contains any text other than "No problems found
  with the conversion.", you should enter a NOIS as soon as possible for
  assistance with resolution of the problem.
  
  If the patch is being re-installed, no conversion message will be sent.
  
  
  DOCUMENTATION:
  ==============
  The User Manual and Technical Manual for Consult/Request Tracking
  have been updated to reflect the enhancements provided by this patch.
  
  The following updated documentation (.PDF) files can be retrieved in 
  BINARY format by FTP:
   
    CONSTM.PDF
    CONSUM.PDF 
  
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch contains an environment check. If the Medicine package is
 installed, it must be at version 2.3 and MC*2.3*27 must be installed.
  
 This patch imports a new file. The GMRC PROCEDURES (#123.3) file is
 contained in the ^GMR global and the size is expected to remain fairly
 static following initial population by the post-install of this patch.
  
 This patch should be installed at non-peak hours due to the high volume
 use of the routines included. CPRS, both listmanager and the GUI, will be
 out of order while data is being converted. Installation and conversion
 should take approximately 20 - 30 minutes per 100,000 entries in the
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file. It is advised that this installation NOT
 be queued.
  
 During the post-install, two data fields in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file
 are converted to a new data format. As with any conversion of data,
 journalling space should be monitored throughout the conversion. The
 records stored in the ^GMR(123, global location are affected by this
 conversion. 
  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation menu.
   3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRC*3.0*15
   4. When prompted " Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//",respond YES.
   5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//", respond NO. 
   6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//", respond YES.
   7. When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':"
      respond with the following options:
           OR CPRS GUI CHART
           OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN 
           OR OE/RR MENU NURSE     
           OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK
           GMRC MGR
           GMRC SERVICE TRACKING
   8. When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':",
      press return.
   9. When prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//", press return.
