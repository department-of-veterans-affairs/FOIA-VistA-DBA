Subject: USER STATION NUMBER CHECK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  1. For a NEW PERSON file (#200) entry, if its DIVISION has no station number
  in the INSTITUTION file (#4), when the New Person tries to access the AMIE
  Regional Office Main Menu, the operation will error out.
          
  The patch will change the code so that when there is no station number for
  the DIVISION under which a user signs on to AMIE, the operation will alert
  the user but not error out. This patch also aims to prevent any user without
  division or its station number from using the AMIE options that require the
  user division or its station number for proper operation. Such a user would
  be able to execute the other options that do not require user division or
  its station number.
    
  Please reference NOIS MWV-0400-20164 and MWV-0400-20155.
     
  2. Claim Folder Location is not a required field in the Patient File, yet
  21 Day Certificate and Notice of Discharge are created and returned based
  on patient's Claim Folder Location. Traditionally, when Claim Folder
  Location or the Claim Folder Location's Station Number is null, a user can
  still request these reports but these reports will not be returned.
    
  After patch, when a user requests 21 Day Certificate and/or Notice of
  Discharge, if the patient's Claim Folder Location or its Station Number is
  null, the user will be alerted of the situation and be prevented from
  requesting these reports.
    
  This problem is found by development.
    
  3. Changes have been made to the driver routines of Reprint C&P Final Report
  and Reprint C&P Report as well, so that the execution of the options will
  not error out when DUZ(2) does not exist or when a patient's claim folder
  location has no station number defined.
     
  The problems are found by development.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to
  users. Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
 
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.] 
 
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*32):
 
 Note - if a multi-build install, options (b.) (c.) and (d.) must be run for
 each individual patch/build included in this transport.  Only (a.) Backup a
 Transport Global and Installation (step 5) can and must be referenced
 exclusively by the primary patch. 
 
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*32.
  
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//".
      respond NO.
 
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
      you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        [DVBA REGIONAL OFFICE MENU]      A.M.I.E Regional Office Main Menu 
        [DVBA MEDICAL ADM 7131 MENU]     A.M.I.E. Medical Administration Menu
 
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
