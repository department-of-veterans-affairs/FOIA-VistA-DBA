Subject: CLEAN UP PATCH FOR TIU*1*179

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Running this patch is optional.  This patch is a follow-up to patch
 TIU*1*179, which fixed a problem related to the Visit (#.03) field in the
 TIU Document file (#8925) not being populated under certain conditions.  
 The primary intent of this patch is to auto-link visits to documents prior
 to the TIU*1*179 fix.
  
 This patch provides a routine to auto-link notes to visits based on a user
 specified date range. The date range cannot be before 8/1/02 or after
 Today.  The routine does not create new visits.  It just auto-links
 documents to existing visits.
  
 Documents must meet the following criteria to be auto-linked:
  
 - Date range cannot be before 8/1/02 or after TODAY
 - Entry Date/Time is within the selected date range
 - No visit has been associated with the document
 - A visit exists to be associated with the document
 - The capture method is direct or remote
 - The status is uncosigned or completed or amended
 - The document is under the progress notes class or consults
 - The document has a signature date/time
 - Workload data should be collected for the document
  
 Special Note about Parameters:
  
   The 'ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS' TIU Document parameter
   is not date sensitive so collecting workload is based on
   the value of this parameter at the time this routine is
   invoked rather than at the time the visit was created.
  
 The patch contains two post-install routines.  The first routine, 
 TIUP188, contains an entry point to prompt for a date range and
 search the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925) to find documents which
 can be auto-linked to the appropriate visit based on the criteria
 above.  The second routine, TIUP188P, contains an entry point to
 print a detailed list of the results.
  
 Details for invoking the routine associated with this patch can be found 
 in the post-installation instructions below.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
 =========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system.  The post-install 
 routines are NOT invoked automatically.  Installation of this patch will
 take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
   
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
    select the Installation menu.  
  
 3. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
    options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*188): 
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global 
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*188.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
    respond NO.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==============================
 1. The patch installation does not invoke the routine EN^TIUP188.  
 The routine needs to be invoked from programmer mode.  When running 
 the routine, the following recommendations are made:
  
 - Users may be on the system and options enabled
  
 - The job should be queued to run during off-hours
  
 - The job should be run at a time that does not conflict with a system 
   backup
  
 - Processing times for this task will vary considerably, depending on
   the load on your system and the number of entries processed in the TIU
   DOCUMENT file.
  
 - If you need to stop the task while it is running you may use the
   TASKMAN USER option on the TOOLBOX menu to do so. To restart 
   the task invoke EN^TIUP188 from Programmer Mode. The task will
   continue from the last entry processed. Only one task should be 
   processed at a time.  This is to support the start/stop feature in
   taskman.  If multiple tasks are started it will be necessary to stop all
   jobs and invoke the routine again.
  
 - The global ^XTMP("TIUP188", will be set as records are processed but the
   size of the global will be relatively small.
  
 2. To invoke the post-init routine from Programmer Mode type:
  
    D EN^TIUP188
  
 A sample of invoking the routine is as follows:
 ==============================================
  
 DEV,CUR>D EN^TIUP188
  
 PATCH TIU*1*188
  
 Automatically Link the missing VISIT field for a date range of documents
  
 Documents must meet the following criteria to be linked:
 - Date range cannot be before 8/1/02 or after TODAY
 - Entry Date/Time is within the selected date range
 - No visit has been associated with the document
 - A visit exists to be associated with the document
 - The capture method is direct or remote
 - The status is uncosigned or completed or amended
 - The document is under the progress notes class or consults
 - The document has a signature date/time
 - Workload data should be collected for the document
  
   Special Note about Parameters:
  
   The 'ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS' TIU Document parameter
   is not date sensitive so collecting workload is based on
   the value of this parameter at the time this routine is
   invoked rather than at the time the visit was created.
  
 Please specify a date range:
    Beginning: 8/1/02  (AUG 01, 2002)
         Thru: 5/12/04 (MAY 12, 2004)
  
 Requested Start Time: NOW//  (MAY 12, 2004@12:24:00)
  
 A task has been queued in the background and a bulletin will be sent
 to you upon completion of the task or if the task is stopped.
 Please only run one date range at a time.
  
 The task number is 5081945.
  
 3. A bulletin will be sent when the job is finished.  The bulletin will 
 provide a summary of the results and instructions on how to print the
 results.  Since the bulletin is sent to the user who queued the job,
 please make sure it is forwarded to the appropriate people which would
 include the Clinical Coordinator(s).  The printout of the results
 should also be given to the Clinical Coordinator(s).
  
 A sample of the bulletin is as follows:

   -Number NOT linked because - Entry in Use: 0
   -Number NOT linked because - No Matching Visit: 69
  
 TOTAL Number of entries processed: 2746
  
 Task COMPLETED successfully.
  
 To print a detailed listing of ALL records processed invoke D 
 PRINT^TIUP188P.
  
 4. The printout is a cumulative output.  It will include ALL records 
 processed to date via the post-installation routine.  For each record the
 following information will be printed:
  
 - Patient field #.02 from file #8925 with (Last 4 PID)
 - Document IEN from file #8925
 - Title field #.01 from file #8925
 - Reference Date field #1301 from file #8925
 - Hospital Location field #.22 from file #9000010
 - Visit/Admit Date&Time field #.01 from file #9000010
 - The Linked column reflects Yes and the Visit IEN from file #9000010 if 
   the document was linked, otherwise No-Multiple Visits or No-Entry in
   Use or No-No Matching Visit
  
 A sample of invoking the routine is as follows:
 ==============================================
  
 DEV,CUR>D PRINT^TIUP188P
  
 This routine will print ALL records processed to date by the
 auto-link routine independent of the date range selected at
 processing time.
  
 This report requires a column width of 132.
  
 DEVICE: HOME//  ANYWHERE
  
 5. After the patch has been installed successfully and the post-install
 routines have been invoked successfully for the site specified date 
 ranges, sites may delete the post-install routines, TIUP188*, after
 verification of the checksums.
  
 6. Option Clean old Job Nodes in XUTL [XQ XUTL $J NODES] will 
 automatically delete the ^XTMP("TIUP188") global nodes created by running 
 EN^TIUP188 approximately 3 months from the date the routine is run.
