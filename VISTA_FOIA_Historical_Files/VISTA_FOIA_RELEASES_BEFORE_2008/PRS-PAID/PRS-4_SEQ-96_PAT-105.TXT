     PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) are not formatted correctly.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW
  -------------
  1. HD55422 - FGH-1003-31000  VCS Allotments showing wrong decimal place
        
        Problem:
        -------
        The VCS Allotments field in files PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) and 
        PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) are not formatted correctly.  
        They do not contain any decimal places and there should 
        be two decimal places.
        
        Resolution
        ----------
        Corrected routine PRSDPR09 to read and process the incoming VCS 
        Allotments amount with two decimal places. 
        A post-install routine has been created to correct existing fields
        on user systems to contain two decimal places. 
        As this problem has been in place since the release of PRS*4*86, 
        the routine will correct the pay periods from that point through 
        the last pay period on file.
        Please refer to the post-install instructions.
   
   
  2. HD55527        File 450 seems to not be defined in data dictionary
            HD149541 - Duplicate  Fileman Access to file Paid Employee #450
  
        Problem:
        -------
        Fields in the PAID EMPLOYEE file (#450) seem to be incorrectly 
        defined for fields 758, 759, 760, 761.
        Noticed this after patch PRS*4*48 was installed.  While running
        [PRSD 04 PRINT EMPLOYEE FILES] option, unable to select the 
        following fields:  
    
        HLTH CARE FLEX SPEND ACCT YTD  (#758)    PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)  
        HLTH CARE FLEX SPEND ACCT CPPD (#759)    PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)  
        DPNT CARE FLEX SPEND ACCT YTD  (#760)    PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)  
        DPNT CARE FLEX SPEND ACCT CPPD (#761)    PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)  
        
        Resolution
        ----------
        Changed the Read Access to fields 758, 759, 760, 761 
        in PAID EMPLOYEE file (#450) to 'FP' so they may be selected 
        for print.
   
   
  3. HD118016        Typo in DD definition of file 458.5
        
        Problem:
        -------
        The word 'this' is spelled incorrectly in the Data Dictionary
        description of the PRIOR PP EXCEPTIONS file (#458.5), field 
        number 7.
        
        Resolution
        ----------
        Changed 'tHThis' to 'This' in the Data Dictionary description
        of the PRIOR PP EXCEPTIONS file (#458.5), field number 7.

  POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   
  Run DEVICE^PRSXP105. The report should be queued to run at night to 
  minimize the number of records that couldn't be locked and corrected.
  
  Report prompts are as follows:
      Select Device: HOME// QUEUE TO PRINT ON  (enter 'Q')
             DEVICE: HOME// PLANO3       (enter a valid output device)
  
  1 PLANO3$PRT 10/6/UP   PLANO TEXAS
  2 PLANO3$PRT 12/6/UP   PLANO TEXAS
  3 PLANO3$PRT 16/6/UP   PLANO TEXAS
 Choose 1-3> 1  PLANO3$PRT 10/6/UP  PLANO TEXAS
  
 Requested Start Time: NOW//  (JUL 20, 2006@23:43:08)
 Request Queued
  
  No report will print to the device input at the time of 
  queueing. The reports will be sent via mailman to the
  PAD mailgroup and to the user that queued the report. There
  are two reports - one for each file #450 and #459. These two
  reports will show the employees that were corrected along with
  the old VCS Allotment value and the new VCS Allotment value 
  after correction.
  
  Reports 450/459 will not be generated until the entire process is
  complete. 
  All unlocked records will be corrected, then the 450/459 
  reports will be sent to the mailbox.
  
  If there were any employee records that were locked and therefore 
  couldn't be corrected, a locked report will identify these records.
  If no employee records were locked, the LOCKED report will not 
  be produced.
  
  There should not be a great number of employees that
  were locked but, if there are, please contact the Help Desk at
  1-888-596-4357.
  
  NOTE:
  ==============
  This report should NOT be re-queued. Some of the VCS Allotment amounts
  could be changed a second time which would cause incorrect entries.
