Subject: MISC CAPRI FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects four issues:
  
     1. The CAPRI version of the "Exam Requests by Date Range" Report is 
        not working. Users are receiving the following error message: 
  
             Error encountered.
             Function was: M ERROR=<UNDEFINED>EXAMBYDT+9^DVBABEBD
  
     2. The CAPRI version of the "Pending C&P Exams" report always returns 
        "No pending request found for select parameters." when "status" is 
        selected for the "sort by field".  The status type chosen has no 
        effect on the outcome.
  
     3. The CAPRI version of the "Admission Inquiry By Date" report is not
        working on certain sites when the user runs the report for all ROs.
  
     4. The CAPRI version of the "Admission Report for SC Veterans" report 
        is not working on certain sites when the user runs the report for 
        a specific date range.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD118674 - CAPRI Exam Requests by Date Range Report does not work
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Several sites are reporting that the CAPRI version of the "Exam
     Requests by Date Range" Report is not working. Users are receiving the
     following error message: 
  
             Error encountered.
             Function was: M ERROR=<UNDEFINED>EXAMBYDT+9^DVBABEBD
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The problem was related to bad data.  All of the sites that reported 
     the problem had at least one incomplete entry in file 396.3 (2507 
     REQUEST). The "0" node was missing and the code was assuming it would 
     always be there (as it should be).  I added code to properly handle 
     the bad nodes.   The root cause of the bad data could not be
     identified at this time but all of the bad nodes in question were
     very old.
  
 2. HD133067 - CAPRI Pending C&P Exams Status Report Not Working
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The CAPRI version of the "Pending C&P Exams" report always returns 
     "No pending request found for select parameters." when "status" is 
     selected for the "sort by field".  The status type chosen has no 
     effect on the outcome.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     There was a logic flaw in the code that handles the sorting of the 
     report. This problem has been fixed.
  
 3. HD121522 - Admission Inquiry by Date report Not Working
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The CAPRI version of the "Admission Inquiry By Date" report is not
     working on certain sites when the user runs the report for all ROs.  
     Users are getting the following error message:
  
     "RPC DVBAB REPORT ADMINQ could not be accessed!"
  
     After they click OK, they get the following message:
  
     "No data found for requested report criteria."
  
     The problem shows up in the VISTA error log as: 
     <SUBSCRIPT>SET+1^DVBAADRP
  
     Affected Sites: 
     Bay Pines (516) & North FL/South GA (Gainesville) (573) VAMCs 
  
     I also identified a problem with the date range on this report.  The 
     CAPRI GUI was adding 1 day to the end date and the M side RPC would 
     then add an additional half day.  This was meant to ensure that the 
     ending date was included in the report since the data is stored as a 
     date/time.  However, adding 1.5 days to the end date would extend the 
     date range by 1 day.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The problem is caused by a patient having a CLAIM FOLDER LOCATION 
     (field #.314 of the PATIENT file) that points to an institution that
     does not have a STATION NUMBER (field #99 of the INSTITUTION file) 
     entered for it.  This is causing the M side to error out during the
     RPC call that builds the report.  The code was checking for the 
     existence of the node contains the station number (^DIC(4,D0,99)) and
     if did not exist it was use "UNKNOWN" for the field for sorting 
     purposes.   It was not checking for a null value of the station 
     number and this was what was causing the problem.  I added code to 
     also use "UNKNOWN" when the field is null.
  
     To correct the date range problem, I changed the M side to subtract 
     half a day from the ending date that is passed in from the GUI side.  
     This corrects the problem with the date range having 1 day added to 
     it.
  
 4. HD133821 - Bay Pines S/C Admissions Report Not Working for 03-01-06
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The CAPRI version of the "Admission Report for SC Veterans" report 
     is not working on certain sites when the user runs the report for 
     a specific date range.  Users are getting the following error message:
  
     "RPC DVBAB REPORT ADMISSIONS could not be accessed!"
  
     After they click OK, they get the following message:
  
     "No data found for requested report criteria."
  
     The problem shows up in the VISTA error log as: 
     <SUBSCRIPT>SET^DVBAB54
  
     Affected Sites: 
     Bay Pines (516)
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The problem is caused by a patient having a CLAIM FOLDER LOCATION
     (field #.314 of the PATIENT file) that points to an institution that
     does not have a STATION NUMBER (field #99 of the INSTITUTION file)
     entered for it.  This is causing the M side to error out during the

     also use "UNKNOWN" when the field is null.
