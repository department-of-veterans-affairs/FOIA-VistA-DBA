  Installation:
  
    1.  DSM sites - This routine may be mapped,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines. 
       
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
       
    4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
        non-peak time.  (There is a very small possibility of some CLOBER
        errors)
  
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*77'
                               =========
          
       
    6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
