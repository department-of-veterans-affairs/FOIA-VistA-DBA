 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 An accession area is set up to point to an OOS location but the OOS
 location going to PCE is coming from the laboratory site file (file 69.9).
  
 Solution:
 --------
 Use the OOS location from file 69.9 unless there is an OOS location set up
 for the accession area (file 68) in question. If there is an accession
 area OOS, use it to send to PCE rather than the OOS location from the
 laboratory site file.
