Subject: FIX PRINT ISSUE THAT AROSE FROM PSB*3*20

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses Remedy Ticket HD127231, which arose after the
 install of patch PSB*3*20.  Patch PSB*3*20 added the patient header
 information to the MAH report if the report for a medication ran longer
 than one page.  Additionally, PSB*3*20 was designed to reprint the
 first six lines of the orderable item information on subsequent pages
 to help the nurses keep track of what medication they were viewing
 on the MAH report.  However, when the next medication on the report
 was due to be printed, and a page break occurred before the orderable
 item information was printed, the second page of the report printed
 the first six lines of the orderable item in duplicate.
  
 The fix included in this patch will still print the patient header
 information on subsequent MAH pages, but it will not reprint the first
 six lines of the orderable item information.
  
 **NOTE** This fix only affects the report when printed to a printer.
 It does not affect the GUI display or the printing of the report
 to the terminal screen.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
 HD127231 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a page break occurs at the point that the report is starting to
 print the orderable item information on a medication, the subsequent
 page is duplicating the first six lines of the orderable item information.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Rework CONT^PSBOMH2 so that it better determines when to initiate
 a page break, and also remove the code from PSB*3*20 that reprints the
 first six lines of the orderable item information on subsequent pages.
  
 Also update PRN^PSBOMH2 so that PRN orders also print header info on
 subsequent pages, and page break appropriately.
