 I. DESCRIPTION
    ===========
  
 This patch introduces Business Rule changes needed to support TIU
 Interdisciplinary Notes.  It is distributed with patch TIU*1*100 in one
 master build. Functional descriptions and installation instructions are
 included in the patch description for TIU*1*100.
  
 Users are urged NOT to create business rules for Interdisciplinary
 Notes without carefully reading the Interdisciplinary Notes Documentation
 (see patch TIU*1*100) and the patch description for TIU*1*100.
  
  
  
 II. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
     ====================
     
 File ^USR(8930.8,    USR ACTION:
 ================================
     
 The following new actions are distributed with the patch:
  
 1. New action: ATTACH ID ENTRY
    Rules involving this action determine whether or not a particular
    interdisciplinary parent note can receive interdisciplinary children,
    and who can do the attaching.
 2. New action: ATTACH TO ID PARENT
    Rules involving this action determine whether or not a particular child
    note can be attached to interdisciplinary parent notes, and who can do
    the attaching.
  
 The following fields were changed/created to accommodate Interdisciplinary
 Notes:
  
 1. New technical description for NAME (.01) warns developers about the
    side effects of changing the name of an action.
 2. Field .05 USER VERB was renamed to distinguish it from new field
    DOCUMENT VERB.  (It was named simply VERB.)
 3. New field DOCUMENT VERB (.06) permits actions to have an explicit verb
    form applying to documents.  E.g., BE SIGNED
 4. New field USER VERB MODIFIER (.07) is used in certain "You cannot..."
    messages.  E.g., the modifier for action LINK is "with a request".
 5. New field IDENTIFYING PHRASE (.08) is available to help users identify
    the correct action when writing rules.  E.g., "Rule applies to
    individual ID CHILD entries"
 6. New identifier on field NAME (.01) writes the action's IDENTIFYING
    PHRASE next to the action in lists of actions.
                                   
    
 File ^USR(8930.2,    USR ROLE:
 ==============================
    
 1. New field DESCRIPTION (1)
    This field was needed to describe new ROLE: COMPLETER 
 2. New role COMPLETER: The completer of a document is the person
    (signer or cosigner) whose signature completes (authenticates) the
    document.
  
  
 File ^USR(8930.1,    USR AUTHORIZATION/SUBSCRIPTION:
 ====================================================
    
 Three changes were made to input template: USR DEFINE AUTHORIZATIONS: 
  
 1. When a user is writing a rule with an action sufficiently complex to
    have an identifying phrase or a verb modifier, the user is given
    feedback stating the rule they are creating in sentence form, as soon
    as they choose an action.
 2. If a user selects action ATTACH ID ENTRY, the user is allowed to write
    the rule for TITLES or DOCUMENT CLASSES only, not for classes.
 3. If a user selects action ATTACH ID ENTRY, and chooses a title or
    document class as required, the user is warned that rules which permit
    notes to be interdisciplinary parent notes OVERRIDE rules permitting
    notes to be child notes.
