Subject: UPDATE OF SCREEN FOR SELECTION ITEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the DD screen for the SELECTION ITEM sub-field of the 
 HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE (#142) file, to correct the selection list 
 of entries displayed in the menu option Create/Modify Health Summary Type .
   
 The subroutine, invoked by the DD screen, was modified so that the 
 screen's pattern match allows selection of entries which have the
 SYNONYM field (#.09 in the HEALTH FACTORS (#9999999.64) file),
 of the pattern GEC_n_XXXX.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD0000000086785
  
    Problem:
    --------
    As Reported
    +++++++++++
    Health Summary Component (GECH) not allowing selection item, in option 
    Create/Modify Health Summary Type [GMTS TYPE ENTER/EDIT], but are
    available in selection list in direct FileMan.
  
    As Analyzed
    +++++++++++
    Items that should be displayed are not displayed, at the prompt:
      "Select SELECTION ITEM:", in the option:
    
    Create/Modify Health Summary Type [GMTS TYPE ENTER/EDIT].  
    
    The HEALTH SUMMARY component SYNONYM (#.09) field was changed to
    GEC_n_XXXX.  The SELECTION ITEM multiple field of the SELECTION ITEM
    (#142.14) multiple, in the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE (#142) file,
    has a DIC("S") to allow selection of only items appropriate for the
    component.  The invoked routine (GMTSGEC) first checks the
    ABBREVIATION (#3) field in the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT (#142.1) file,
    then sets the screen using three fields of the HEALTH FACTORS (#9999999.64)
    file: ENTRY TYPE (#.1), INACTIVE FLAG (#.11), SYNONYM (#.09).
    It was originally expecting the SYNONYM to be GECC_n_XXXX, and now must
    be set to handle the character pattern starting with 'GEC'.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The routine execution of the DIC("S") screen is modified to 
    evaluate the correct character pattern.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
      This patch can be installed with users on the system.
      Installation should take less than 1 minute.
      1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu, to
          load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
      2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines in the Routine
          Summary are mapped, then they should be removed from the 
          mapped set at this time.
      3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
          select the Installation menu.
      4.  From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following
          options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMTS*2.7*39):
            a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            b.  Print Transport Global
            c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
            d.  Backup a Transport Global
      5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select package GMTS*2.7*39.
      6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//', answer 'NO'.
      7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? YES//', answer 'YES'.
      8.  When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
          enter the following option:
            'Create/Modify Health Summary Type [GMTS TYPE ENTER/EDIT]' 
      9.  When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as Out Of Order:',
          press <return>.
      10. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//', press <enter>.
      11. If you removed routines from the mapped set in step 2 above, then
          you should return those routines to the mapped set once the
          installation has run to completion.
