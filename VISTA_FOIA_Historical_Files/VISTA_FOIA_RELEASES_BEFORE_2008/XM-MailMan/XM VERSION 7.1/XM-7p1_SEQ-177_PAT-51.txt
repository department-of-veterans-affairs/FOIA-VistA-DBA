 Patch XM*7.1*51
 
 Test Sites:  Montana HCS; Biloxi, MS
 
 NOIS: DET-0898-40391, CIH-1197-40757, ALL-0297-41999, BTM-1095-10195
 
 Patch XM*7.1*50, released August 1999, added ".MED.VA.GOV" synonyms in the
 DOMAIN file for every site which requested it.  It also added new names as
 synonyms for sites which have merged or which requested and had name changes
 approved. 
 
 This patch will complete the 2-step domain name change process begun in patch
 XM*7.1*50. The synonyms will become the new domain names, and the old domain
 names will become the synonyms.  The domain names will be changed in the
 transmission scripts.  The names of the transmission queues will be changed.
 (These are the Postmaster's baskets where the messages waiting to be
 transmitted are kept.)  And finally, the domain name of the site will be
 changed, too, if it is one of the sites which requested it. 
 
 This will all happen automatically, during the post-init.  It should take
 less than 5 minutes.  You will be instructed to review the install file print
 to check for and correct any errors after the patch has been installed. 
 
 The domain name changes will not adversely affect the flow of mail.
 
 This patch will also begin the 2-step domain name change process for the
 second round of domain name changes.  It will add as synonyms the desired
 new names for sites which requested it.  For all other VA sites, which did
 not express any interest in changing their names, it will add a synonym of
 xxx.MED.VA.GOV.  A future patch will complete the domain name change
 process, once all sites have installed this patch.
 
 NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

 Review the automatic synonym additions which occurred during the PRE-INIT.
 If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
 have its new name added as a synonym.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
 and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and add
 the synonym manually.  Remember, you are not to change any domain name.
 Just add the new name as a synonym. 
 
 Review the automatic domain name changes which occurred during the POST-INIT.
 If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
 have its name changed.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
 and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and
 perform the name change manually.
