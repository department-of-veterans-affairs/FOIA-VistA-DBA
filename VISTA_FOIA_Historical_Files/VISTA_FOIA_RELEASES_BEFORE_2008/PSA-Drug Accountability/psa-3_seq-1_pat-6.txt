Subject: Y2K COMPLIANCE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The following changes were made to address Y2K compliance issues.
  
 Routine   : PSAUDP
 Line Tag  : PICKLST+10
 Exception : Setting the node in global ^XTMP("PSAPV",0) to DT+1 would not
             be appropriate for dates such as FEB 28th.
 Resolution: Changed to a "C^%DTC" call which uses VA FielMan to calculate
             the correct date.
  
 Line Tag  : PROCESS+11
 Exception : Flagged to be changed 
             $E(PSADT-100-(+$E(PSADT,4,5)=1*8800),1,5)*100
 Resolution: No change necessary, the code is calculating the previous
             month, and all Y2K checks appear to function correctly.
  
 Routine   : PSAUP1
 Line Tag  : XTMP+21
 Exception : Use of checking to see if number is >90 does not comply with
             a 70-30 split.
 Resolution: Changed to check for date within the recommended 70-30 split.
