 This patch is a follow up patch of the Interim Address Enhancement 
 project.
   
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
 The functional changes that will be introduced with this patch include:
   
 1. A new report, Report - All Address Change with Rx [DG ALL ADDRESS 
 CHANGE WITH RX], will be available. The report lists patient permanent 
 address changes that happened within 24 hours, for those patients with
 active pharmacy prescriptions. The report will be emailed to a local mail
 group named "DG DAILY ADDRESS CHANGE". The report can be scheduled as a
 daily task via TaskMan. It is recommended to run the report during other
 than normal business hours. The option, Report - All Address Change with
 Rx [DG ALL ADDRESS CHANGE WITH RX], will be added to the Registration Menu
 [DG REGISTRATION MENU]. 
  
 If the mail group DG DAILY ADDRESS CHANGE does not have any member in it, 
 the report will not be sent:
   Select OPTION NAME: DG ALL ADDRESS CHANGE WITH RX
   DG DAILY ADDRESS CHANGE does not have a member. Report not sent.
  
 To add members to the mail group:
   Select Group/Distribution Management Option: MAIL GROUP EDIT
   Select MAIL GROUP NAME: DG DAILY ADDRESS CHANGE
   MAIL GROUP NAME: DG DAILY ADDRESS CHANGE  Replace
   Select MEMBER: (please add in all the members to whom the DG ALL ADDRESS
   CHANGE REPORT should be sent)

  Installation Steps
  ==================
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text
  only.] 
   
  2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE 
  SUMMARY section of patches DG*5.3*560, they should be removed from the 
  mapped set at this time.
   
  3. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the 
  Installation menu.
   
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
  prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*560).
   
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
   
       d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
   
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select DG*5.3*560.
   
  6. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is 
  recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be 
  rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
   
  7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install? 
  YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
   
  8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
  Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you 
  would like to place out of order, enter the following:
   
         Report - All Address Changes [DG ALL ADDRESS CHANGE REPORT]
         Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
         Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
   
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be returned 
  to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
  10. Please note that depending on the number of patients having had 
  permanent address changes during the 24 hour timeframe, with each
  patient taking up to 16 lines, the report could have many lines. Please
  ensure your MailMan configurations will allow the report to be emailed.
