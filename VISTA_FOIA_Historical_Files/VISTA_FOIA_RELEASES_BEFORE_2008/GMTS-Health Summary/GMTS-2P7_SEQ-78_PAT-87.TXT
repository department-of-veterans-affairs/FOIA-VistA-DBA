Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch releases three new national Health Summary Types and three new 
 national Health Summary Objects. These items will be used by two new national 
 dialogs for Skin Risk Assessment, sponsored by VA Nursing Outcomes Database 
 (VANOD).
 
 Health Summary Types:
        VA-BRADEN SCALE 30D
         VA-PRESSURE ULCER
        VA-PU INTERVENTIONS
 
 Health Summary Objects:
        VA-BRADEN SCALE 30D (TIU)
        VA-PRESSURE ULCER (TIU)
        VA-PU INTERVENTIONS (TIU)
 
 Pre and post-install routines will install these items. If the site installing
 the patch was a test site for the original VANOD SKIN RISK ASSESSMENT dialogs,
 Health Summary Types, and Health Summary Object, these items will be renamed 
 to national names.
