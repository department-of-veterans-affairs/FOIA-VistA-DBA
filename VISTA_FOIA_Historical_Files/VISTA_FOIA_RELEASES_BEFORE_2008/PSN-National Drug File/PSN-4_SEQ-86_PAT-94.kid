This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that 
"BLD",5318,1,2,0)
will be used by calling applications that currently do direct global 
"BLD",5318,1,3,0)
reads or writes to the National Drug File files.  A review of the 
"BLD",5318,1,4,0)
previously released APIs showed several entry points where additional 
"BLD",5318,1,5,0)
pieces of data were required to be returned.

If you have already made code modifications, or have made plans to make
"BLD",5318,1,8,0)
code modifications to use any of the new APIs, please check the latest
"BLD",5318,1,9,0)
version of the API manual to verify that the API(s) in question have an
"BLD",5318,1,10,0)
Active status. The API manual has been modified since the original version
"BLD",5318,1,11,0)
to indicate Active and Inactive APIs. If the API(s) you need have an
"BLD",5318,1,12,0)
Inactive status, please contact the Pharmacy Re-Engineering team at the
"BLD",5318,1,13,0)
