Subject: Allocation Failure During Transmission

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
   During transmission of the Clinical Trainee data is was possible for an 
 allocation error to occur and the data not to be transmitted, yet VistA 
 would "think" it had been transmitted.  In cooperation with the Office of 
 Academic Affiliations(OAA) this patch will do the following:
  
 1.  Fix the allocation error.
  
 2.  Install a new menu option so a current count of Clinical Trainees
     can be obtained.
  
 3.  Install a new MAIL GROUP.  Persons that are members of this mail 
     group will now receive a message that will indicate how many records 
     were transmitted to the Office of Academic Affiliations(OAA).
  
 4.  Execute a post install that will do the following:
     a.  Re-index the "ATR" cross reference.
     b.  Retransmit all persons who are indicated as Clinical Trainees.
