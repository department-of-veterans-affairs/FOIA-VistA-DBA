  inactivated:
  
  - For RESPIRATORY (OBSTRUCTIVE, RESTRICTIVE, AND INTERSTITIAL)
  - For RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS
  - For MENTAL DISORDERS (not initial PTSD and eating disorders)
  - For PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES

  Then file AMIE EXAM (396.6) will be updated with new entries for
  the exams with the following names:
   
  - RESPIRATORY (OBSTUCTIVE, RESTRICTIVE, AND INTERSTITIAL)
  - RESPIRATORY DISEASES, MISCELLANEOUS
  - MENTAL DISORDER (except PTSD and Eating Disorders)
  - PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS AND MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASES
  - INITIAL EVALUATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
   
  The above listed names reflect the existing ones and the new ones
  while some of them are slightly modified per the request.

  - REVIEW EXAMINATION FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
   
  and a new entry to AMIE EXAM file will be added.
   
  The Reporting Programs print the heading, common to all exams, as follows:
    
  Name: PATIENT,MARY A.                        SSN: 000001456
                                              C-number: 
  Date of exam: ____________________
   
  Place of exam: ___________________
  
  The requested changes to the Printing Programs will modify the heading to:
   
  Name: PATIENT,MARY A.                        SSN: 000001456
   
  Date of Exam: ____________________           C-number:
  
  Place of Exam: ___________________
 
  Additionally Reporting Programs will be modified to show headings being 
  centered automatically, based on a selected printing mode - for example 80
  or 132 characters per line.
