Description: 
============

 Vitals/Measurements is being enhanced to support the documentation of
 pain.  Pain will be considered a fifth vital sign.  Users will be able to
 quickly document a patient's pain intensity by entering a pain score.
  
 At the time of this patch release, the pain measurement
 edit/viewing will only be available via the Nursing and Vitals
 applications.  Currently these functions will not be available via CPRS
 and Health Summary.
     
  Pain Score
  ==========
    0        -  No pain
    1 -> 10  -  Level of pain (10 = worst imaginable pain)
    99       -  Patient unable to give pain score
  
  New GMRV Vital Type file (#120.51) Entry
