 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch 206 is an emergency release to enhance performance based on reports
 following installation of CPRS GUI v22 (patch OR*3*173).  Updates are
 noted below.
  
  
 UPDATES:
 =======
  
 -- GENERAL PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
  
 - NOIS: LON-0903-61476 - It appears that calls to a single RPC 
 (ORWPT ID INFO) multiplied excessively due to a programming 
 inefficiency.  This has been corrected.
  
 - Notes - Performance issues:  Extraneous remote procedure calls were
 eliminated from the note creation logic.  This should now be somewhat
 faster, especially where boilerplate or templates are involved.  Another
 unnecessary call was removed from the program code that displays the note 
 popup menu.
  
 -- TIU TEMPLATE LOADING
  
 - A general slowdown of loading for TIU Templates was reported.  A fix 
 has been provided to return the process to former expected performance 
 levels.  
  
 -- NOTES
  
 - Several sites reported an issue with signed empty progress notes.  Only 
 one path to this problem has been reliably reproduced to date.  Clicking 
 on the "New  Note" button more than once can lead to a situation where 
 the user appears to be editing more than one note at the same time.  Both 
 notes are shown in the treeview, but on signature, only one note is saved 
 with the text that was entered.  The other is signed, but blank.  In this 
 version, the "New Note" button  will be greyed out once a note is started 
 by clicking either the button or the menu option. It should now be all 
 but impossible to be editing more than one note at the same time.  This 
 fix should eliminate that one known cause of the empty note problem.  
 There may still be other, as yet unknown, paths to this error.  Continued 
 monitoring of the situation using the reporting tool included in  
 TIU*1*174 will be required to insure any additional problems in this area 
 are addressed promptly in future patches.
  
 -- CONSULTS, PROCEDURES
  
 - A small change was made to reduce the number of calls to the ORWDX 
 DGNM remote procedure.
  
 -- PROBLEMS TAB
  
 - NOIS: WAS-1003-20405 - When editing a problem shown as having an
 inactive code, and selecting a problem via the Lexicon lookup with the
 same text but a new code, it was impossible to save this change since the
 new problem was seen as a duplicate of the old.  This has been corrected.
  
 - As a result of the same NOIS, it was discovered that if a CPT-coded item
 were selected via the Lexicon lookup, an inappropriate value could be 
 filed in the problem record as the code for the problem.  This was 
 introduced with the code set versioning changes, and has been corrected. 
 CPT-coded items will again be filed with an ICD9 code of 799.9 as they
 always have.
  
  
 REQUIRED BUILDS:
 ===============
  
     OR*3.0*203
  
 NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE4) or later is REQUIRED in order for 
 GUI version 22 to run.  However IE 5.5 or later with 128-bit
 encryption is required for PKI functionality.

 INSTALLATION FILES: 
 ==================
  
 The following software and documentation files, including the last 
 file which contains Delphi source code, are exported as part of 
 this patch:
  
    File Name             Contents                    Retrieval Format
    ---------             --------                    ----------------
    OR_30_206.ZIP         File(s) indented below      BINARY
     - CPRSCHART.EXE          CPRS Executable
   *OR_30_206_SRC.ZIP     CPRSChart Source             BINARY
  
 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================= 
  
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 disruption.  This patch should be installed within 5 days.  Users may be
 on the system during installation.  Installation should take approximately
 1 minute.  
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package OR*3.0*206.
  
 5.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? Yes//", respond "NO".
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
     YES//', you may respond "NO".
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond "NO".
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
     completion.
  
 9.  Following successful installation, the pre/post-install routine 
     ORY206 may be deleted.
  
 10. Retrieve and open the file OR_30_206.ZIP.
  
 11. Move the CPRSChart.exe file to the appropriate directory where
     it can be accessed by all CPRS workstations.  (There are no
     changes in the HLP files or manuals from Patch OR*3*203.)
