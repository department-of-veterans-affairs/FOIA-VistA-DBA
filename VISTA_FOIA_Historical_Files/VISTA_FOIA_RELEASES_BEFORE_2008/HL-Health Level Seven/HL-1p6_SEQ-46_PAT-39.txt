Subject: HL7 TCP Logical Links for CIRN

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

               **Please READ BEFORE YOU PROCEED**
   
  This patch configures Logical Links and Lower Level Protocol parameters
  for VA sites in the CIRN wide area network. These links make use of the
  MLLP/TCP protocol provided in HL7 patch 19. The TCP/IP address and service
  port for HL7 messaging has been provided to the CIRN TEAM by each of
  the sites.
  
  The Logical Links in this patch all begin with the letters 'VA' or 'MPI'.
  These links are sent with the field, 'AUTOSTART', set to 'Disable'.  You
  should NOT start these links. The CIRN implementation team will enable the
  links when CIRN is activated at your site.
 
   
  **PRECAUTIONS**
   
  1. ALL SITES
  DO NOT INSTALL THIS PATCH IN YOUR TEST ENVIRONMENT. To prevent data
  from being misrouted from a test system to a production environment the
  logical link definitions are to be installed on production systems only.
   
  2. Current CIRN PD/MPI V1.0 Sites
  This patch should be installed in your production account.
  The ENVIRONMENT CHECK will check if you have already installed a previous
  version of this patch.  If you have, it will remove the Logical Link
  information in this patch.  You should see the message:
    A previous version of patch 39 was already installed.
    Removing patch data.
  Installing this patch will just update your Patch Application History and
  send a message to Forum.

      following options:
        Shut Down All Logical Links
        Stop all incoming filers
        Stop all outgoing filers
   
      For DSM sites ONLY, if you have an HL7 UCX Service associated
      with the account(uci/directory) where you are installing this patch,
      please disable this service.
     
   3. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. This option

      options:
    
         2   Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
         3   Print Transport Global 
         4   Compare Transport Global to Current System 
         5   Backup a Transport Global

      and Protocols?'.  
  
   5. During the install, you might see messages like:
       'Couldn't resolve Domain MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV for Logical Link MPIVA'
      Ignore these, they will be resolved by the CIRN implementation team
      when CIRN is installed at your site.
 
   6. Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers. Use the 
      'Restart All Links and Filers' option.  
   
      This will only restart the links that are 'autostart' enabled.
      The links in this patch are exported with all links set to 'autostart
      disabled.'
  
      For DSM sites ONLY, if you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
      for this installation, you may now enable it.
