Subject: CORRECT INPUT TRANSFORM IN DRUG INGREDIENTS FILE (#50.416)

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The input transform on the VUID field (#99.99) in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file
 (#50.416) became corrupted in such a way that editing that field would cause
 a syntax error.  That field is not edited at VAMCs.  This patch corrects
 the syntax of that input transform.
