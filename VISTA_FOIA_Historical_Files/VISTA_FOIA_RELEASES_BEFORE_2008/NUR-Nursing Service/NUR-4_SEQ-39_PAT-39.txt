Subject: SHOW PAST ACT/SEP ON EMPLOYEE ACT/SEP REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch fixes the problem of past Start Dates and Vacancy Dates

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 
 FGH-0103-31506  EMPLOYEE ACTIVATION/SEPARATION REPORT - NO DATA
 CTX-0403-71833  Not getting data on Auto Print:  Separation/Activation 
                 Report
 
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering start dates and vacancy dates for Nursing staff during the 
 editing of status and position data (e.g. via the Staff Record Edit option, 
 NURAED-STF-MENU), only those dates that are greater than or equal to the 
 current date when entered show up on the Employee Activation/Separation 
 Report.  This presents a significant problem since it is common practice to 
 enter in start and/or vacancy dates after they have occurred.
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The logic that sets the "ASD" cross-reference in the NURS POSITION CONTROL 
 file (211.8) was modified to create this cross-reference when past dates 
 are entered in either the START/TRANSFER DATE field (#.01) or the VACANCY 
 DATE field (#3) of the OCCUPANCY/TRANSFERRED DATE multiple (#2) of the NURS 
 POSITION CONTROL file (#211.8).  The logic for the killing of this 
 cross-reference during the Nursing Acuity/Separation run was also modified 
 to accommodate the change. The "ASD" cross-reference controls the addition 
 of entries to the STAFF EMPLOYEE multiple (#2) of the NURS AMIS DAILY  
 EXCEPTION REPORT file (#213.5), which is used to generate the Employee 
 Activation/Separation Report.
 
 This change does not affect the entering of START/TRANSFER DATE or VACANCY 
 DATE.  These fields will allow dates in the past, present or future as 
 before.  After this patch is installed, dates entered in these two fields  
 that are in the past will show up on the Employee Activation/Separation  
 Report for the day that the dates were entered.

 DISTRIBUTION:
 =============
 This patch is exported using KIDS.
 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the
 impact on users of the Nursing package.
 Installation will take less than 1 minute.
 
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
 
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE   
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
     at this time.
 
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
 
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter NUR*4.0*39):
 
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package NUR*4.0*39.
 
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
 
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options you 
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
 
     NURAAM-ACU            Nursing Acuity/Separation-Activation Run
     NURAAM-ACUMAN         Manual Nursing Acuity/Separation Run
         
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
