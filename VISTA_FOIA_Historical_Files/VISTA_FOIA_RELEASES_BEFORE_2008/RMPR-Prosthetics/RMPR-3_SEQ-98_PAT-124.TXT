Subject: FILE 660 AND 664 DD NON-COMPLIANT FIELD LENGTH CLEANUP UTILITIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 DESCRIPTION:
 ===========
 Prosthetics GUI not adhering to Fileman Data Dictionary parameter length 
 guidelines in RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (# 660) file for REMARKS 
 (#16) field, LOT NUMBER (#21) field and DELIVER TO (#25) field as well as 
 PROSTHETICS 1358 (# 664) file for fields:  BRIEF DESCRIPTION (#02,1)
 field, REMARKS (#02,7) field, SERIAL NUMBER (#02,15) field, MANUFACTURER
 (#02,15.2) field, MODEL (#02,15.4) field, LOT #(#02,15.6) field, DELIVER
 TO (#19) field and DELIVER TO ATTENTION (#21.1) field.
   
 The data length is too large and is causing mail group messaging of 
 Purchase Order information to error. This is preventing National 
 Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) roll-up.
  
 ** A national alert was sent to all the Prosthetics sites warning them of 
    this situation in GUI Purchasing to remind the user to stay within the 
    field length constraints until a GUI patch is released controlling the 
    data entry.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 HD126389 - HQ not receiving NPPD data due to corrupt RMPR
    Duplicates:  HD126667, HD127372)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Prosthetics GUI not adhering to Fileman Data Dictionary parameter 
    length guidelines in RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file for 
    REMARKS (#16) field, LOT NUMBER (#21) field, DELIVER TO (#25) field as
    well as PROSTHETICS 1358 (#664) file for BRIEF DESCRIPTION (#02,1)
    field, REMARKS (#02,7) field, SERIAL NUMBER (#02,15) field,
    MANUFACTURER (#02,15.2) field, MODEL (#02,15.4) field, LOT #(#02,15.6)
    field, DELIVER TO (#19) field and DELIVER TO ATTENTION (#21.1) field.
  
    This has caused errors in mail group messaging of Purchase Order
    information due to field length errors and preventing national
    NPPD roll-up.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch will create an option that will search and display 
    fields in RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file and 
    PROSTHETICS 1358 (#664) file that have a length error created by
    the GUI Purchase Order process.  The new option added to the 
    RMPR UTILITIES [UT Utilities] menu:
  
          [FCLN   RMPR file cleansing for field lengths]
  
    This option will allow for ongoing cleansing until the GUI patch 
    (RMPR*3*75) is completed to resolve the data length errors.
  
  
 Processing Instructions:
 ==================
 The option will compile using PROSTHETICS 1358 (#664) file, looking
 through each order/item for any field that exceeds the defined Vista
 Fileman length requirement. The 2nd process will allow a report by clerk
 to be printed for any field length errors.  The 3rd process will allow
 entry of an internal key to find/display/correct associated field length
 errors.
