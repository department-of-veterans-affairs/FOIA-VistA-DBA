 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD55253 SBY-1001-32600  ERROR - CP+12~PRCSUT:1, %DSM-E-NULLSUBSCR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A null subscript error occurs when accessing Change Existing 
 Transaction Number [CHANGE EXISTING TRANSACTION NU] option under the
 Create 2237 [CREATE 2237 (PPM)  PRCN NX PPM 2237] menu option.
 This occurs when a user has access to multiple control points at a
 specific site and one is not selected properly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change needed to be made to routine PRCSUT to account for a possible 
 null value in the control point variable.
  
  
 Technical Description
 =====================
 HD55253 SBY-1001-32600  ERROR - CP+12~PRCSUT:1, %DSM-E-NULLSUBSCR
  
 The user was running another option that set the PRC("CP") variable to 
 null.  This caused an error to be thrown because only $D was used to 
 validate the data in PRC("CP"), which is equivalent to asking if the 
 variable exists.  The variable did exist so it used the null value in a 
 global reference.  An additional check for IF PRC("CP") was added. This 
 seemed to best solution and not to clear/kill/new the PRC("CP") 
 variable.  By leaving the value in PRC("CP"), the feature that allows the
 system to remember what the last Control Point the user selected will 
 remain.
