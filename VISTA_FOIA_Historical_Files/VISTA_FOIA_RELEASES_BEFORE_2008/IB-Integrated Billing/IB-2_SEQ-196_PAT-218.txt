Subject: MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE AND PENSION CY 2003

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

 The purpose of this informational patch is to assist sites in the entry 
 of the Basic Pension rate and the Medicare Deductible value which are both
 required for use in the Integrated Billing package.
   
 1. Basic Pension rate:
    -------------------
  
 The Basic Pension rate is used to determine whether a veteran is exempt
 from the medication co-payment requirement, when the veteran's eligibility
 for the co-payment is based on income.
   
 The new rate for Calendar Year (CY) 2003 (with an effective date of
 12/1/02) is defined in VHA Directive 2002-082, dated December 13, 2002 as:
   
 *   $ 9,690 for a single veteran without dependents 
 *   $ 12,692 for a veteran with 1 dependent 
 *   An additional $ 1,653 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent 
   
 To enter the new Basic Pension rate, use the Add Income Thresholds
 [IB RX ADD THRESHOLDS] option of the Medication Copay Income Exemption Menu
 [IB RX EXEMPTION MENU].  See the example below.
   
 **************************** N O T E **************************************
 After entering the Basic Pension rate, if your system has any instances
 where there are Medication Co-payment Exemptions based on prior
 thresholds, you will see the note 'there are Medication Co-payment
 Exemptions based on prior thresholds'. If you see this prompt, you will be
 asked to Select one of the following:
     1.  IGNORE
     2.  PRINT
     3.  UPDATE AND PRINT
 You should choose #3 to UPDATE AND PRINT these exemptions. You should
 queue this job to run and print the output to a printer.

 ********Please Note********
  
 It is recommended that the new Medicare deductible rate be added to the
 system by the effective date of 1/1/2003. Since the rates will be added 
 after the effective date, it is possible that some Means Test veterans could
 be under-billed. These veterans would be anyone whose Means Test Billing 
 Clock starts on or after 1/1/2003, and who subsequently received inpatient
 care.
