Subject: SCRIPTALK(R) - TALKING PRESCRIPTION LABELS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains routines, new options, new Data Dictionary fields, and
 documentation for implementing the ScripTalk(R) 'talking' prescription
 labels functionality, which will greatly benefit visually impaired
 veterans.
  
 Thanks to Rob Silverman at Hines for his extensive research and
 development work for a class III solution, upon which this patch is based.
  
 ScripTalk(R) Talking Prescriptions will provide the ability for VA points
 of care to purchase and distribute adaptive equipment to patients who are
 unable to read the traditional label on prescription bottles. This patch 
 provides a way to print to a microchip-embedded label that can be applied 
 to a medication bottle. When the label is held next to a ScripTalk(R) 
 reader, the reader will read the contents of the label aloud to the 
 patient. This improves patient safety for patients with substantial loss 
 of vision as it allows them to safely determine the contents and 
 administration schedules of their medications.
  
 ScripTalk(R) is a registered trademark of En-Vision America.
  
 In addition to the ScripTalk changes, this patch corrects some laser
 labels formatting problems in the warning label and method of pick-up
 sections. 
  
 NOTE: As part of the laser labels corrections, the utility routine that 
 was used in patch PSO*7*141 has been modified. A correction for the return
 mail initialization control code in the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2) has been
 added. Once the patch is installed, run the routine PSOLLU3 in programmer
 mode. Once you have updated all current laser label devices, the routine
 may be deleted.

        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
