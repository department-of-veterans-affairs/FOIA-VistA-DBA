 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD104922       Correction of Audit Problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When billing CHAMPVA Other Health Insurance, the bill must be audited
    prior to submission. Currently, the automatic default is set to fund
    3220 which is incorrect. Funds should go to fund 0160A1.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PRCACPV to change the fund from 3220 to 0160A1 in the
    BD which is sent to FMS when the CHAMPVA THIRD PARTY of the bill is
    audited.
  
    Also modified the new fund from 3220 to 0160A1 for the CHAMPVA THIRD
    PARTY category in piece 5 of the listing below which exists in routine
    RCXFMSUF.
