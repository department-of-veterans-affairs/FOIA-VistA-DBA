Associated patches: (v)XU*8*90     <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*94'

Subject: KERNEL Update for RUM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
  This patch is in support of the new Capacity Management namespace KMPR.
  The Kernel routines will call ^%ZOSVKR through %ZOSV and the XQOR routines
  will call %ZOSVKR directly.
  
  The %ZOSV routine has been modified to call the new %ZOSVKR routine.
  This should help protect folks outside of the VA who use VistA.
   
  The ZTMGRSET routine has been updated to save the new routine under the
  correct name.
  
  The ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* are included unchanged at the request of the DBA.
  These routines were introduced with patch XU*8*90.  Patch XU*8*90
  installed certain ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* routines based on your platform's
  operating system.  Please do not be alarmed if you are notified prior to
  installing patch XU*8*94 that certain ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* routine do not
  exist in your account.
  
  MWV-0398-21933  ZTMS3  Add to the after task cleanup IO("P"),IO("DOC")
                         so they can't upset re-queuing of following tasks.

  ========================================================================= 
  Installation:
  
    1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
        
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
        
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
           
   4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
        users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
        acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
        Also place TASKMAN in a wait state, and stop submanagers.
        
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
           Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*94'
                                =========
                                
          No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
          Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                          ==
        
    6.  After installing this patch, 
        DSM sites rename ZUVXD to ZU.
        OpenM sites rename ZUONT to ZU.
        MSM sites rename ZUMSM to ZU.
        
    7.  OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
        DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
        your production account to each manager account:
        
        ZTMGRSET
        ZTMS
        ZTMS3
        ZOSVMSM
        ZOSVONT
        ZOSVVXD
        ZOSVKRM
        ZOSVKRO
        ZOSVKRV
        ZOSVKSME
        ZOSVKSMS
        ZOSVKSOE
        ZOSVKSOS
        ZOSVKSVE
        ZOSVKSVS
  
    8.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
        All sites:
        DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
        Select the System
        Patch number to load: 94
                              ==
         
    9.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
   10.  Enable user's login.
        Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.
