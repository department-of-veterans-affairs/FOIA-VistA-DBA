============

 ******************************* N O T E **********************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
 problems.
 **************************************************************************
  
 1. RESIDENT SUPERVISION
    The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook 1400.1, dated May 3, 
    2004, changed the levels of resident supervision for operating room 
    procedures. This patch implements the new levels of resident 
    supervision in the Surgery software and includes the following
    features:
  
  (a) A new file, ATTENDING CODES file (#132.9), is created to store all 
      attending codes used by the Surgery software. These codes include 
      both sets of Levels 0 to 3 (before and after patch SR*3*126, all
      flagged as inactive codes) and the latest codes for Levels A to F
      (active codes).
  
  (b) The name of the existing ATTENDING CODE field (#.165) in the SURGERY
      file (#130) is changed to *ATTENDING CODE - NOT USED and a new
      ATTENDING CODE field (#.166) is created that points to the ATTENDING
      CODES file (#132.9).
  
  (c) The patch includes a post-install conversion that loops through all 
      the cases in the SURGERY file (#130) and matches the attending code
      in the old field (#.165) with the equivalent code in the new
      ATTENDING CODE field (#.166), storing the equivalent code in the new
      field. The content of the old field is not changed by the conversion.
  
  (d) The following data entry options are updated to use the new ATTENDING
      CODE field (#.166): 
      - Post Operation [SROMEN-POST] 
      - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT] 
      - Surgical Staff [SROMEN-STAFF] 
      - Edit Non-O.R. Procedure [SRONOP-EDIT] 
      - Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE]
  
  (e) The following report and display options are updated to use the new 
      ATTENDING CODE field (#.166): 
      - Attending Surgeon Reports [SROATT] 
      - View Patient Perioperative Occurrences [SROMEN-M&M] 
      - Operation Information [SROMEN-OPINFO] 
      - Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] 
        Note: The Perioperative Occurrence Categories on this report are
        updated to reflect the categories used by the National Surgical
        Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the Continuous Improvement
        in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP). Some of these categories may
        not be immediately available for selection, but will be included
        later in the NSQIP/CICSP ENHANCEMENTS 2004 patch (SR*3*125).
      - List of Operations Included on Quarterly Report [SROQ LIST OPS] 
      - Report of Missing Quarterly Report Data [SROQ MISSING DATA]
  
  (f) The patch updates the transmission of Quarterly Report data to the 
      national database to use the new ATTENDING CODE field (#.166).  
  
 2. ENSURING CORRECT SURGERY PHASE II
    Phase II of the Ensuring Correct Surgery Enhancement Project provides
    the following enhancements:
  
  (a) The following new fields are added to the SURGERY file (#130):
      - TIME OUT VERIFIED COMMENTS field (#82)
      - IMAGING CONFIRMED COMMENTS field (#83)
      - MARKED SITE COMMENTS field (#84)
  
      These fields are added to capture the comments corresponding to the
      following:
      - TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71)
      - PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72)
      - MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#73)
  
  (b) The following data entry options will be modified to include
      the new comment fields noted in item (a):
      - Operation [SROMEN-OP]
      - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT]
      - Nurse Intraoperative Report [SRONRPT]
  
      Entry of "NO" in any of the three Correct Surgery fields will prompt
      the user to enter the associated comment field. Entry of "NO" in
      any of the three Correct Surgery fields will not automatically force
      entry into the respective comment field.
  
  (c) Nurse Intraoperative Report Changes
      If any of the three Correct Surgery fields are not answered, the
      nurse will not be able to electronically sign the Nurse
      Intraoperative Report. If any of the three Correct Surgery fields is
      answered "NO" but does not have information in the corresponding
      comments field, the nurse will not be able to electronically sign the
      Nurse Intraoperative Report. The nurse will be able to update this
      information at time of signature without leaving the option.
  
  (d) The compliance reports, which were disabled in phase I are 
      reactivated and are modified to display the new formats for the three
      Correct Surgery fields.
  
  (e) Convert Existing Comments
      For each of the three Correct Surgery fields answered with a "NO" 
      response, the information in the CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#27)
      of the SURGERY file (#130) will be replicated in the corresponding
      comment field.
      At the end of the conversion process, this patch will delete the data
      dictionary of the CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#74) in the SURGERY
      file (#130), which was exported in phase I of the Ensuring Correct
      Surgery patch SR*3.0*126.
  
 3. SURGEON PRESENT TIME ON NURSE INTRAOPERATIVE REPORT
    Patch SR*3*25 modified the Nurse Intraoperative Report so that it 
    displayed the SURG PRESENT TIME field (#.206) only if data was entered.
    This functionality, omitted unintentionally by patch SR*3*100, is
    restored by this patch.
  
 4. DOCUMENTS PRINTED FROM TIU
    This patch modifies the routine SROESPR to correct a possible problem 
    if no print group is defined when a document is printed.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity with
 Surgery users off the system. This patch includes a data conversion
 process, so installation may take 10 to 15 minutes depending upon the
 numbers of cases in the SURGERY file (#130). Installation of this patch 
 should NOT be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines in this patch are
     mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set before continuing.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
  
  4. From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following
     options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*129):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global option - This option creates a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes, such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or
         templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System option - This option
         allows you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (for
         example, routines, DDs, templates, and more).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global option - This option ensures
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global option - This option allows you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*129.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
 Note: The pre-installation process calls PRE^SR129UTL to initialize the 
       ATTENDING CODES file (#132.9).
       
       The post-installation process calls POST^SR129UTL to perform the 
       following tasks:
        - The new ATTENDING CODE field (#.166) is populated with the 
          equivalent value from the old *ATTENDING CODE - NOT USED field 
          (#.165). 
        - For existing cases, if any of the correct surgery fields are
          answered NO, the information entered in the CORRECT SURGERY
          COMMENTS field (#74) is replicated in the new specific fields.
        - The data dictionary and data for the CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS
          field (#74) is deleted.
        - The Quarterly Report for the 2nd quarter of FY04 is transmitted.
        - If this patch is installed after August 6, 2004, the Quarterly
          Report for the 3rd quarter of FY04 is transmitted.
