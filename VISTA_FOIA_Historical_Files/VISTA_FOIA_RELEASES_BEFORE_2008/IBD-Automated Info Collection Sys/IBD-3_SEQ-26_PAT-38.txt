Subject: CPT MODIFIERS FOR AICS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description: 
============

   The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) provides a standard coding
 method for procedures performed by medical providers, in which each CPT
 code represents a distinct procedural service.  CPT Modifiers provide the
 means by which providers can indicate that a procedure has been altered
 by some specific circumstance, without altering the definition or code of
 the procedure itself.  In short, CPT Modifiers provide additional
 information about the procedure.
   
   This patch implements the CPT Modifiers in AICS.  One important benefit
 of implementing CPT Modifiers in AICS is that they provide additional
 information about clinical procedures, thereby enriching the data stored
 in PCE.  Another major benefit is that it will provide many of the
 necessary building blocks to permit the implementation of CPT modifiers by
 other packages (i.e., PCE, TIU, CPRS).
   
   This patch will be cleaning the Import/Export Workspace during Pre-Init.
  
   DATABASE 
   ========
  
   Field ASK FOR CPT MODIFIERS? (#.21), which is a Y/N question, was
 added to the PACKAGE INTERFACE file (357.6).  Field CPT MODIFIER (#3) was
 added to SELECTION file (357.3).  Field SELECTION (#.14) within the
 BUBBLES (1) multiple was added to FORM DEFINITION file (357.95). Field

   DATABASE INTEGRATION AGREEMENTS (DBIA)
   ======================================
  Several packages utilize AICS DBIA #1296 GETLST^IBDF18A to retrieve a
 list of components on Encounter Forms for a given Clinic.  The output will
 be modified to include CPT Modifiers if applicable.  See below for
 details.
  
  -- output  The format of the returned array is as follows
          @ARY@(0) = count of array element (0 of nothing found)
          @ARY@(1) = ^group header
          @ARY@(2) = P1 := cpt or icd code / ien of other items

   ADDING CPT MODIFIERS TO THE ENCOUNTER FORM
   ==========================================
  
  Edit Encounter Forms [IBDF EDIT ENCOUNTER FORMS] has been modified to
 allow for three additional design choices.
  
    a.  CPT Modifiers at Selection of List Building
    b.  Marking areas for writing in CPT Modifiers that will have to be
        Input during manual Data Entry.
    c.  Creation of a List of CPT Modifiers to be printed on the form.  This
        List will serve as a key (printed only/ not selectable).
  
 When a modifier is to be associated with a CPT Code, the CPT Code block
 will need to be edited down to the level that the CPT Code is selected.
 After the selection of the CPT Code, the Quantity, Print Order within
 group, CPT Modifier, and SubColumn Header will be prompted for input.  See
 below for a partial example.  The CPT Modifier will not display on the
 form but will be passed to PCE when the CPT Code is selected at data
 collection either via scanning or manual data entry.

 An additional ToolKit will be added.  The CPT MODIFIER DISPLAY (V3.0)
 ToolKit can be added to a form to be used as a key.  The list contents
 will contain CPT Modifiers defined by the user.  The list will print on
 the form but will not be selectable at data collection.  It's purpose will
 be to assist providers in selecting appropriate CPT Modifiers when
 filling out a form manually.
