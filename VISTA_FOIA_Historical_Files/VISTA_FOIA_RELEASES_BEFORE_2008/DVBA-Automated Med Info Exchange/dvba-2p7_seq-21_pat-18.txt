Subject: CORRECT PROBLEMS WITH EXAM TRANSFERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

   The routine modifications included in this patch have been made to 
   address issues raised in the following NOIS entries: 
   
   BUT-0198-21352
   NIN-1196-41963
   TOP-1097-42734
   
   These issues involve the transfer of AMIE C&P exam requests between 
   medical centers.  The revisions will prevent (1) duplicate entries from
   being made to the PATIENT file (#2) of the target site, (2) erroneous 
   overwrite of patient demographic data at the target site, and (3) entry
   of 2507 REQUEST (file #396.3) records without accompanying entries in 
   the 2507 EXAM file (#396.4) at the target site.
    
   (1) Routine DVBCXFRC has been revised as follows:
   
       (a) Any update or addition to the PATIENT file (#2), the 2507 
           REQUEST file (#396.3), and the 2507 EXAM file (#396.4) is 
           prevented unless a primary division at the target medical 
           center has been found.
    
       (b) Any update or addition to the PATIENT file (#2), the 2507 
           REQUEST file (#396.3), and the 2507 EXAM file (#396.4) is 
           prevented unless a unique station# for the Regional Office
           of the requesting site can be found in the INSTITUTION file
           (#4) of the target site.
   
       (c) Before any update to the PATIENT file (#2) is allowed, the 
           "SSN" index will be checked for an exact match to the SSN 
           of the patient contained in the exam request.
   
           If more than one exact match is found, then no update is made
           and a special error bulletin is returned to the requesting
           site.
           
           If one exact match to the SSN is found, but the name and/or
           DOB do not coincide with the patient name and DOB contained 
           in the exam request, then no update is made to file #2 and 
           a special error bulletin is returned to the requesting site.
           
           If no match is found, then a new entry is made to file #2 
           for the patient contained in the exam request.
           
       (d) If for any reason the exams contained in the transfer request 
           cannot be added to the 2507 EXAM file (#396.4), then 
           the request that had just been entered in the 2507 REQUEST 
           file (#396.3) is deleted, and a special error bulletin is 
           sent to the requesting site.
    
   (2) Routine DVBCXFRD has been revised as follows:
       
       (a) If the exam request transfer has failed because a primary 
           division at the target medical center could not be found, 
           then an error bulletin is returned to the requesting site
           stating:
             
           Reason for failure:
           Addition of C&P request record at target site failed.
           Could not determine primary medical center division.
   
       (b) If the exam request transfer has failed because a unique
           Regional Office station number could not be found at the 
           target medical center, then an error bulletin is returned
           to the requesting site stating:
              
           Reason for failure:
           Addition of C&P request record at target site failed.
           Your Regional Office station # (xxx) is not unique
           in the Institution file of the target site.
    
           Or
    
           Reason for failure:
           Addition of C&P request record at target site failed.
           Your Regional Office station # (xxx) could not be found
           in the Institution file of the target site.
   
           (Where 'xxx' is the Regional Office station #.)
  
       (c) If the exam request transfer failed because more that one 
           record in the PATIENT file (#2) matched the SSN in the exam 
           request, then an error bulletin is returned to the requesting 
           site stating: 
    
           Reason for failure:
           Update of patient data at target site failed.
           More than one entry matches the value 'nnnnnnnnn'.
           
           (Where 'nnnnnnnnn' is the patient SSN.)
    
       (d) If the exam request transfer failed because only one record
           in the PATIENT file (#2) matched the SSN in the exam request,
           but the name or DOB did not match, then an error bulletin
           is returned to the requesting site stating:
              
           Reason for failure:
           Update of patient data at target site failed for SSN nnnnnnnnn.
           Patient name and/or DOB at target site does not match transfer
           request.
           At target site --
           Name: LAST,FIRST NAME   DOB: MAR 6, 1928
   
       (e) If the exam request transfer failed because of a problem in
           filing new entries to the 2507 EXAM file (#396.4), then an error 
           bulletin is returned to the requesting site stating:
   
           Reason for failure:
           Addition of C&P exams for request record at target site failed.
           Therefore, the C&P request record was deleted.
   
       The specific information contained in these bulletins should ease
       resolution of identified problems.  If any of these bulletins is
       received by the requestor, it should be discussed immediately with
       appropriate personnel at the target site.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  However, it would be
   preferable to perform the installation at a time when it is less likely
   that AMIE C&P exam requests are being transferred to your facility.
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*18):
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DVBA*2.7*18.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
      
            Process C&P Mail Message  [DVBA C PROCESS MAIL MESSAGE]
   
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
