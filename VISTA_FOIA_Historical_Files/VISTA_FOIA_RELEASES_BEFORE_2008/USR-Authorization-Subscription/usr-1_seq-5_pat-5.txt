Associated patches: (v)USR*1*4     <<= must be installed BEFORE `USR*1*5'

Subject: ELIMINATE MULTIPLE PROMPTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 There are some User Classes that can have multiple matches. For example,
 when adding a User Class to a user, if the User Class of NURSE is selected 
 the following is presented:
  
 Select USER CLASS: NURSE
      1   NURSE  
      2   NURSE ANESTHETIST  
      3   NURSE CLINICAL SPECIALIST  
      4   NURSE LICENSED PRACTICAL  
      5   NURSE PRACTITIONER  
      6   NURSE STUDENT
  
 Once the selection is made and before the actual addition is made to the
 file, there is an opportunity to change the original User Class selection.
 In those cases when the original selection has multiple matches, i.e.,
 NURSE the entire list was presented a second time and required that the
 selection be made again. This patch eliminates the second presentation of
 the entire list and requirement to make the selection again.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
