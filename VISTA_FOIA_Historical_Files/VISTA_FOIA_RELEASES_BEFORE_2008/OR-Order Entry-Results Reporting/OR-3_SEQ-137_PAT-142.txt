Description: 
============

 The process by which orders are delayed for future release and the
 conditions under which orders will auto-discontinue is being enhanced.
   
 This enhancement will come in two parts.  Part one, OR*3*142, will contain
 the tools necessary to define the release events for delayed orders as
 well as the rules (conditions) for auto-discontinuing orders.  Part two,
 which will be the implementation of these new release events and rules,
 will be included in patch OR*3.0*141 (GUI v20).
  
 This patch installs the necessary files and editor to support the 
 installation and maintenance of the events and rules that will be applied 
 to orders entered into CPRS.  It should be noted that no change to 
 current CPRS functionality will change with the installation of this 
 patch.
  
 Files #100.5 and #100.6 have been redesigned to support the new 
 functionality.  
  
 File OE/RR RELEASE EVENTS (#100.5) will contain the definition of the
 events to which orders can be delayed. These definitions can include
 multiple treating specialties, locations, etc., grouped under a single
 name to facilitate proper selection of events.  When the event occurs, the
 orders that were delayed will be released.  In addition to MAS events, a
 surgery-based event can be identified as well as a manual release event.
  
 File OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES (#100.6) will contain the definition of the 
 conditions under which you would like to have orders auto-discontinued.  
 You will now be able to define when and what gets auto-discontinued when 
 an event occurs.  In addition to the MAS events, you'll also have a 
 surgery event that you can base the rule on.
  
 A new menu option, Delayed Orders/Auto-DC Set-up (OR DELAYED ORDERS) will 
 be added to the CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu.  This new option 
 will allow CACs to set up and maintain the release events and 
 auto-discontinue rules.
  
 This patch includes a post-init as well.  This post-init will review the 
 settings of the OR DC ON SPEC CHANGE, ORPF DC OF GENERIC ORDERS, and the  
 OR DC GEN ORD ON ADMISSION parameters and automatically establish a basic
 set of auto-dc rules for your primary division. These parameters, along 
 with the OR DELAYED ORDERS LAPSE DAYS parameter, will be REMOVED by the
 installation of patch OR*3*141 (gui v20) and will no longer be used.
  
 ********************************************************************
 **NOTE: Multi-divisional sites must set up auto-discontinue rules ** 
 **for all divisions.  The ability to copy a rule is available in  **
 **the editor when entering new rules.                             **
 ********************************************************************
  
 Serious thought and consideration needs to be given to how you set up 
 your release events and auto-dc rules.  You will only be able to delay 
 orders to the events that you set up.  No events means no delayed 
 orders.  For auto-dc rules, a basic set of rules that mimics your current 
 settings will be set up for you by the post-init.  These pre-set rules 
 should be reviewed and changes/additions made as needed (see note above 
 for multi-divisional sites).
  
 In addition to the above infrastructure tools, you will also have new 
 tools available to you when patch OR*3*141 (GUI v20) is installed.  
 Included in this will be a way to list all orders released and/or
 auto-discontinued as a result of an event, a way to view all delayed
 orders grouped by event, the ability to manually release an order from the
 GUI, a way to change an order's release event, and others.  In addition,
 the detailed display has been updated so that it now shows the event the
 order was delayed to, when it was released, whether it was released
 manually or by an event, and what event auto-discontinued it.
  
 File access permission to file #100.5 and #100.6 will need to be
 determined locally and access granted to the appropriate personnel.
  
 DOCUMENTATION:
 ==============
 Two new appendices have been added to the CPRS Technical Manual.  They 
 are Appendix F ("Creating, Editing, and Viewing Release Events") and 
 Appendix G ("Automatically Discontinuing Orders").  There is also a 
 new section in the CPRS Technical Manual called "CPRS Tab Access and 
 Reports-Only Access".  That section has been added in anticipation of 
 the release of patch OR*3*148 and will be functional at that time.  The
 preferred method of obtaining the updated CPRS Technical Manual,
 CPRSLMTM.PDF, is by using FTP to access download.vista.med.va.gov.  You
 may also retrieve the file directly from the following sites:
  
   CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY

 INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption
 to users who can remain on the system during installation. Installation
 will take approximately 10 minutes.  Systems with heavy user loads
 or performance problems may take longer.
  
 This patch includes a post-init.  This post-init will review the settings
 of the OR DC ON SPEC CHANGE, ORPF DC OF GENERIC ORDERS, and the  OR DC GEN
 ORD ON ADMISSION parameters and automatically set up a basic set of
 auto-dc rules for your primary division.
  
 **NOTE: If you are a multi-divisional site you must set up 
 auto-discontinue rules for your other divisions as well.  The ability to
 copy a rule is available in the editor when entering new rules.
  
 **NOTE: File access permission to file #100.5 & #100.6 will need to be 
 determined locally and access granted to the appropriate personnel.
