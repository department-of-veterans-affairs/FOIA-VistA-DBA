Description:
============

  Phase I of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus
  Group Initial Requirements Analysis (IRA) project consists of four
  patches. The patches are combined in host file PSJ_PSS_OR_PSU_110.KID in
  order to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
  facilities. Installation of this host file should be coordinated among
  the four packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The
  patches, in order of install, are:
  
       PSS*1*79   PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
       PSJ*5*110  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
       OR*3*213   ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING V. 1.0
       PSU*3*34   PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT V. 3.0
  
  Patches PSS*1*79, OR*3*213, and PSU*3*34 contain changes to support the
  following enhancements in PSJ*5*110:
  
  1. The Extend Stop Date on Renewal enhancements will allow an order to be
  renewed without creating a new order. Editing of the start date will no
  longer be allowed during the renewal process. In addition, limits have
  been set on the length of time after an order expires that it may be
  renewed. This is outlined in the Bar Code Medication Administration
  (BCMA) 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #11.
  
  2. The Complex Order enhancements will change the way complex orders are
  handled by linking complex components (child orders) together. If the
  actions Finish, Verify, Discontinue, or Renew are taken on one child
  order, the user will be alerted that the action must be taken on all of
  the complex component orders in the set. The user will then be prompted
  to take the appropriate action on each child order in the complex order
  set. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #8.
  
  3. The STAT and NOW Order Notification enhancements will alert users
  subscribing to new mail group PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER when a pending
  STAT or NOW order has been received from Computerized Patient Record
  System (CPRS) V. 1.0. Users subscribing to the new mail group PSJ STAT
  NOW ACTIVE ORDER will receive an alert when a STAT or NOW order is made
  active. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement
  #12.
  
  Changes to PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) V. 3.0 have been included
  in this patch to address the following issues:
  
  1. Problem:  The changes to renewed orders introduced by the Inpatient 
  Medications Requirements for the Special Focus Group IRA, Phase I project
  will allow renewed orders to have an active status for periods of time that
  exceed the current PBM V. 3.0 time period parameters.
  
  Solution:  The code searching for IV and Unit Dose activity within the 
  transmitting period has been modified to accommodate the extended periods 
  of time orders may contain an active status as a result of the changes
  introduced by the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special 
  Focus Group IRA, Phase I project.
  
  2. Problem: In several extracts only the first portion of the patient 
  Integration Control Number is being extracted. The entire Integration 
  Control Number needs to be exported. NOIS: HIN-0503-41359
  
  Solution: Patch PSU*3*34 will correct and extract the entire Integration
  Control Number in the IV multiple (#100) in the Pharmacy Patient file
  (#55) and the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the Pharmacy Patient file
  (#55).
  
  Patch PSU*3*24 will correct the problem in all other applicable files.  
  This is being done so that patch 24 and 34 can move forward without 
  conflict.
