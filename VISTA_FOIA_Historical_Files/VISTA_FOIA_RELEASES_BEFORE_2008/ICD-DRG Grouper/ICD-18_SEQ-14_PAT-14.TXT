Description:
============

 Note: Patches ICD*18.0*14 and LEX*2.0*33 are being released in a single
       distribution and will be installed together.
  
 Gail Graham, Director of Information Assurance, is requesting
 modifications to the VISTA Patient Information Management System (PIMS) 
 Package that would allow the use of multiple versions of the code sets 
 employed in financial transactions.  This includes multiple versions of 
 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) diagnostic related grouping 
 software, also known as the "VHA Grouper".
  
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulates 
 that diagnostic and procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the 
 codes that were applicable at the time the service was provided.  Code 
 sets required by the HIPAA legislation to be date-sensitive and included 
 in this request are:
  
 o ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical 
   Modifications)
  
 o DRG Codes (Diagnostic Related Group which is part of the ICD-9
   code set)
  
 This patch modifies the logic and restructures the file in which the ICDs 
 and DRGs are stored and resolved.
