                         XU*8.0*454
  
 This patch includes the following functionality:
  
 1) Fixes the Add/Edit NPI values for Providers [XUS NPI ENTER NPI FOR 
 PROVIDERS] option.  The option failed to include the following 
 user information:  "Need for an NPI value isn't indicated - but you can 
 enter an NPI", for a provider who did not need a National Provider 
 Identifier (NPI).
  
 2) Modifies the Print Local NPI Reports [XUS NPI LOCAL REPORTS] option to
 allow users to queue the output to desired devices and use up-arrow ("^") 
 to get out of the option.
  
 3) Modifies the TAXIND^XUSTAX(IEN) and TAXORG^XUSTAX(IEN) APIs to accept 
 decimal Internal Entry Number (IEN).
