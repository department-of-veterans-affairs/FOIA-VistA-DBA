Subject: SET BROKER VARIABLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch will set the RPC Broker variable XWBOS in VistALink routine

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
  
  >>>Stop VistALink users.
  >>>Roll and Scroll and RPC Broker Users may remain on the system.
  >>>TaskMan does not need to be put into a wait state.
  >>>If you accept a slight risk of jobs getting a CLOBBER/EDITED error,
  >>>VistALink/Care Management users may remain running. Otherwise, stop
  >>>all other VistALink/Care Management jobs on the system.
  
  1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
  2. None of the routines in the VistALink package have been recommended
     for routine mapping.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XOBV*1.0*1):
  
        a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global. 
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
        d. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. 
  
  5. During the installation, do not run any VistALink-based Client/Server
     software (e.g., Care Management). No VistALink-based client/server
     software should be running while installing this patch on the server.
     You can identify these jobs by checking the system status and
     verifying if any XOBTCPC routines are running (i.e., VistALink
     Handler). If you find any of these jobs running on the system, notify
     users to logoff or FORCEX the jobs. Active users may get NOSOURCE or
     CLOBBER errors.
  
  6. Stop the VistALink listener on the server. Follow your normal 
     procedures to stop the VistALink listener:
     
     a. If your VistALink listener runs via VMS TCP Services, use VMS TCP
        Services to stop the listener.
        
     b. Or, if your VistALink listener runs within M (i.e., not via VMS TCP
        Services), use the Foundations Management menu [XOBU SITE SETUP 
        MENU] to stop the listener.
        
  7. Installation will take less than 2 minutes. 
     Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XOBV*1.0*1.
  
  8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     respond NO. It is *NOT* necessary to inhibit users' login onto
     the system when installing this patch.
  
  9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.  
   
 10. Restart the VistALink listener on the Server. Follow your normal 
     procedures to start the listener.
  
     a. If your VistALink listener runs via VMS TCP Services, use VMS TCP
        Services to start the listener.
        
     b. Or, if your VistALink listener is started within M (i.e., not via 
        VMS TCP Services), use the Foundations Management menu [XOBU 
        SITE SETUP MENU] to start the listener.
