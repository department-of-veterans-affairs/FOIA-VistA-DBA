Description: 
============

  DG*5.3*415, DG*5.3*474, and DG*5.3*489 are required builds for
  patch DG*5.3*505.
     
  Please note: This patch (specifically routine DGRPC) is not compatible
  with class 3 software for pharmacy automated dispensing machines such
  as PYXIS, ILC Mckesson, etc.  If your site is using any class 3
  software, please get the corrections for these dispensing machines
  before installing this patch.
   
  The enhancements introduced in patch DG*5.3*505 are outlined in the 
  MPI Changes Iteration 1 Software Design Document.
    
  1.)  The MPI/PD Data Quality Management team, working on the Master
  Patient Index (MPI) at Austin, needs facility information to improve
  data quality and resolve differences on the MPI.  Functionality,
  provided in DG*5.3*414, enables them to remotely retrieve data
  from those treating facilities at which a patient has been seen.
  This is the same data that is locally available using the Patient
  MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option.  Enhancements
  have been added to this option.  Routine VAFCPDAT has been modified
  to display the MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994) field.  Routine VAFCPDT2
  has been modified to display the POW STATUS INDICATED? (#.525), RACE
  INFORMATION (#2) subfield 2.02, and ETHNICITY INFORMATION (#6) subfield
  2.06 fields.
   
  2.)  Elements have been added to the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS (#38.6)
  file used by the PIMS Consistency Checker.  The checker will determine if
  PLACE OF BIRTH CITY, PLACE OF BIRTH STATE, or MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME are
  missing or if a Pseudo SSN is in use.  The new data elements added to
  the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS (#38.6) file are: POB CITY/STATE MISSING,
  MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME MISSING, and PSEUDO SSN IN USE.  The corresponding
  code changes were made to routines DGPRC, DGRPC2, and DGPRCE1.
     
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  This patch adds the MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994) field to the
  PATIENT (#2) file.  The MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994) field will
  designate whether or not the patient is part of a multiple birth
  (i.e. to identify twins, etc.).  This field is an identifier.
   
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  Refer to informational patch RG*1*33 for directions regarding the
  retrieval of documentation for MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT
  DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD).
   
  Test Sites:
  ===========
  Milwaukee, WI
  Minneapolis, MN
  Northern California HCS

  Pre-Install Routine:
  ====================
  The pre-install routine, PRE^DG505P, examines the INCONSISTENT DATA
  ELEMENTS (#38.6) file.  If anything exists for internal entry numbers
  64, 65, or 66, then the install is terminated.  If this occurs, a
  facility should contact National Vista Support (NVS) for assistance.
   
  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  The MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994) field is an identifier on the
  PATIENT (#2) file.  KIDS does not automatically export the identifier
  on a new field if it is distributed in a partial DD.  Post-install
  routine, POST^DG505P, will set the "ID" node.
    
  POST^DG505P also adds the following elements to the INCONSISTENT DATA
  ELEMENTS (#38.6) file.
      POB CITY/STATE MISSING
      MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME MISSING
      PSEUDO SSN IN USE
      
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*505).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*505.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  The following OPTIONS should be
      disabled during the installation.
          10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
          Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
          Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
          Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
   
  8.  If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, return them to the
      mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
     
  9.  Routine DG505P can be deleted from your system after successful
      installation.
