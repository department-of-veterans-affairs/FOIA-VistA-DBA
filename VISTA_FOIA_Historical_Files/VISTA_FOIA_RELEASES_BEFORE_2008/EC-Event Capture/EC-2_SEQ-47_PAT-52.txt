 (3) The entries to be inactivated in file #725 are:
  
 Natl #      Description                         Inactive Date
 ------      -----------                         -------------

 (4) Once the updates to file #725 have been completed, the patch performs
     an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3). Any ACTIVE
     Event Code Screen which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE
     (file #725) record or to an inactive CPT (file #81) record will be
     identified.
  
     The results of the inspection are placed in a MailMan message and
     sent to the user performing the patch installation.  
  
  EXAMPLE:
  
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
  
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*52 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
  
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725) or to an inactive record in the CPT file (#81).
  
     The user should use the Inactivate Event Code Screens [ECNACT]
     option to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
  
     The National Procedure for the following Event Code
     Screen (500-3-4-245) is inactive or will soon be inactive --
     Location:  ALBANY
     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: FOCUSED COGNITIVE EVALUATION, LEVEL 1 (SP019)
     Inactivation Date: OCT 01, 2003
  
     The CPT procedure for the following Event
     Code Screen (500-3-4-90844) is inactive --

     Category:  JAP EVALUATE
     DSS Unit:  JAP TEST UNIT
     Procedure: PSYCHOTHERAPY, 45-50 MIN. (90844)
  
     2 Event Code Screens were found to be pointing to an inactive
     or soon to be inactive procedure in file #725 or file #81.
