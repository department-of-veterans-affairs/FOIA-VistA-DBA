Subject: EDI/MRA Person Class fix

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch adds a new field with data to the Person Class file: SPECIALTY 
 CODE.  (P.S. data will be added via POST-INIT routine)
  
 This field is necessary for the implementation of IB*2*51.  Integrated 
 Billing will use this field with the EDI Implementation software to 
 transmit specialty codes with electronically submitted professional claims.
  
 This patch also modifies routine XUA4A72, Person Class API's to return a 
 specialty code associated with a specific active class date.
  
 A new label IEN2DATA(IEN) was also added to return person class data. (DBIA 
 1625)
