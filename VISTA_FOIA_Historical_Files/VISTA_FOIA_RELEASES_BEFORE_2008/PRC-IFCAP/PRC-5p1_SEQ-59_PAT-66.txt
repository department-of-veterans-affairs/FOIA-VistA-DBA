Description:
============

 ********************************** IRM NOTE **********************************
 Install this patch within the usual time frame. Your site will receive an
 "Action Request" from the CoreFLS Project Office, which contains instructions
 about assigning the security key. 
  
 You may assign the security key at any time prior to receiving the
 Action Request.
 ******************************************************************************
  
 This patch is in support of a site's preparatory steps for CoreFLS
 deployment. A new menu, Purchase Order Data Cleansing Reports [PRCL
 PURCHASE ORDER], is added to the CoreFLS Data Cleansing [PRCL COREFLS
 DATA CLEANSING] menu as part of the installation of this patch. This new
 menu contains the following report options:
  
     Compile List of Purchase Orders [PRCL PURCHASE ORDER COMPILE]
     Summary Purchase Order Report [PRCL PURCHASE ORDER RPT - SUM]
     Detail Purchase Order Report [PRCL PURCHASE ORDER RPT - DET]
     Missing Purchase Order Number or 'B' x-ref [PRCL MISSING PO NUMBER RPT]
  
 The compile routine examines the IFCAP PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING
 TRANSACTIONS FILE (#442) to determine the purchasing records to convert
 to the CoreFLS system. Once the compile is completed, you may run various
 reports to display, in summary or detail format, the data fields that do
 not conform to the established CoreFLS Data Cleansing guidelines.
