Subject: INSURANCE BUFFER CODE FIX

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

  When 'ACCEPTING' entries from the insurance buffer, it was
  discovered that some of the GROUP/PLAN fields (#.04 through #.09)
  in the INSURANCE BUFFER (#355.33) were not being updated in the
  GROUP INSURANCE PLAN file (#355.3). Upon further review, a coding
  problem was found and corrected in the INSURANCE BUFFER routine IBCNBMI.

  1. CTX-1104-70386 Insurance Buffer Code / Remedy Ticket HD64375
 
 
  Overview of NOIS/Remedy Ticket(s):
  ==================================
  1. CTX-1104-70386 Insurance Buffer Code / HD64375
 
     Problem:
     --------
     At Central Texas VA Health Care System (HCS), Temple, TX, a problem
     was found while using the Process Insurance Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE
     BUFFER PROCESS] option.  When processing (accepting) the insurance
     buffer entry, the data fields in question do not transfer over into
     the patient's record although the user has made that request.
 
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A coding error was found in the routine IBCNBMI. The section of
     code that moves Buffer Insurance Group/Plan data to the GROUP
     INSURANCE PLAN file (#355.3) was corrected.
 
  TECHNICAL:
  ==========
  1. CTX-1104-70386 Insurance Buffer Code Process:
 
     a. PROCESS+2^IBCNBAA calls ACCEPT^IBCNBAR
 
     b. PROCESS+11^IBCNBAR calls routine GRP^IBCNBMI
 
     c. GRP+1^IBCNBMI contains pointers to the GROUP INSURANCE PLAN file
        (#355.3).
 
     A problem at GRPDR+1^IBCNBMI prevented the following Group/Plan data
     from filing.
 
     ;;40.04^.05^Require UR^              ; Utilization Review Required
     ;;40.05^.06^Require Pre-Cert^        ; Pre-Certification Required
     ;;40.06^.12^Require Amb Cert^        ; Ambulatory Care Certification
     ;;40.07^.07^Exclude Pre-Cond^        ; Exclude Pre-Existing Conditions
     ;;40.08^.08^Benefits Assign^         ; Benefits Assignable
     ;;40.09^.09^Type of Plan^            ; Type of Plan
 
     The following line of code, in the routine indicated, was modified:
 
     From this:
     GRPDR ;
     ;;355.3^40.02:40.03;40.1;40.11;40.5:40.09;^.03:.04;6.02;6.03;.05:.09;.12
 
     To this:
     GRPDR ;
     ;;355.3^40.02:40.03;40.1;40.11;40.04:40.09;^.03:.04;6.02;6.03;.05:.09;.12
 
     GETS^DIQ now pulls in the Group/Plan fields (#.04:.09) of the Group
     Insurance Plan file (#355.3) that were not being updated before.
