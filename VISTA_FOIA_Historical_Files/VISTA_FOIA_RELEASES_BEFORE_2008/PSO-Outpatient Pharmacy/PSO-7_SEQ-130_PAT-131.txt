Description: 
============

 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in 
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
 project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
 Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
 entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
 signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
 packages were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
  
 This is the PSO patch that provides the following new functionality.
  
 1. This Outpatient Pharmacy patch contains the software changes to process
 digitally signed orders entered via the Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) V. 1.0 for Schedule II Controlled Substances. This patch lays the
 foundation for the future implementation of the Public Key Infrastructure
 (PKI) once the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) regulations are
 revised and published, and will not be fully functional in this patch.
  
 2. This patch will ensure that no refills will be allowed for any 
 Outpatient Pharmacy prescription for a drug that contains an "F" in the 
 DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50). This NON REFILLABLE
 ("F") code was introduced by the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 patch PSS*1*61.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the 
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks. Do not 
 install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users are on the system or when
 Outpatient orders are being entered and signed through CPRS.  Installation will
 take no longer than 5 minutes.  Suggested time to install: During non-peak
 requirement hours for CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy users.  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
    the Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*131) 
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
      DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*131.  
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
    to completion.
