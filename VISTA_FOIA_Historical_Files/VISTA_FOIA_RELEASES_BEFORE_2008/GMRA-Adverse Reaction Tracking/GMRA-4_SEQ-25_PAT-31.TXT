Subject: Check for compiled cross-references in file 120.8

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 In preparation for the installation of the data standardization
 related patches, sites need to check to see if file 120.8 has
 compiled cross-references.
  
 Patch GMRA*4*23, which will install the necessary data dictionary
 updates in support of the allergies data standardization, will add some
 new cross-references to file 120.8.
  
 In some cases, sites may have compiled the cross-references on file
 120.8.  If that is the case then the cross-references that will be added 
 by patch GMRA*4*23 won't be executed as a result of the compilation of the
 existing cross-references.
  
 In general, the only sites that will have this problem are integrated
 sites.  In some cases, during the integration of the site's database,
 the cross-references for file 120.8 may have been compiled.  In order
 to ensure that file 120.8 does not have compiled cross-references
 we are sending this informational patch to give you directions on how to
 identify and fix this issue should it exist on your system.
  
 If your site has already installed patch GMRA*4*23 and file 120.8 has 
 compiled cross-references you only need to follow the directions below.  
 You DO NOT need to re-install patch GMRA*4*23.
  
 How to determine if file 120.8 has compiled cross-references:
 -------------------------------------------------------------
  
 From programmer's mode do the following:
  
 D ^%G
  
 Device:      Right margin: 80=>
  
 *** Type DD(120.8:120.9,0,"DIK" at the ^Global prompt and hit return. ***
  
 Global ^DD(120.8:120.9,0,"DIK"
 ^DD(120.802,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
 ^DD(120.803,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
 ^DD(120.81,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
 ^DD(120.813,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
 ^DD(120.814,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
 ^DD(120.826,0,"DIK")=A7XAT
  
 If you see any data in any "DIK" node you need to either follow the 
 directions below for fixing this problem or you can log a Remedy ticket 
 and the EVS team will assist you with the clean-up. 
  
 If you do not see any data in any "DIK" node then you don't need to do
 anything.
  
 How to clean up the compiled cross-references:
 ----------------------------------------------
 INTEGRATED SITES:  Your data should look like what is listed above.  If 
 it is then you need to delete all of the nodes that were reported in the 
 global listing.  From programmer's mode use the KILL command for each 
 node listed.  For example:
  
 >K ^DD(120.802,0,"DIK")
  
 You may also wish to delete all the A7XAT* routines as they are no longer
 needed.
  
 NON-INTEGRATED SITES:  Unless your site locally determined that the 
 cross-references for this file should be compiled you should see no data 
 in the global listing.  If you do see data in this node then you need to 
 uncompile the cross-reference by using DIKZ (see example below).  You may
 then delete the routine(s) related to the compilation.  The name of the
 routine related to the compilation will be listed in the same area as the
 A7XAT routine in the listing above.
  
 Using DIKZ to uncompile the cross-references.  
  
 *************************************************************************
 NOTE WELL: This procedure can only be used if the sites compiled the
 cross-references locally as fileman WILL NOT recognize the fact that the
 cross-references are compiled for the one done by the integration team due
 to the fact that the top-level cross-reference node is missing (no
 ^DD(120.8,0,"DIK").
 *************************************************************************
  
 From programmer's mode type
  
 >D ^DIKZ
 Maximum routine size on this computer (in bytes).:  (2400-5000): 5000// 
 Select FILE: PATIENT ALLERGIES  
  Cross-Reference(s) currently compiled under namespace ZGMRA.
 UNCOMPILE the Cross-Reference(s)? NO// YES
  
 Cross-Reference(s) now uncompiled.
  
 You may wish to delete the routine(s) related to the compilation (in the 
 above example it would be ZGMRA*) after you have uncompiled the 
 cross-reference, but it is not necessary.
  
 Integrated sites may see similar information from the EVS Clinical Systems
 Team regarding this issue as we're working together to make sure that all
 affected sites are identified and updated.
