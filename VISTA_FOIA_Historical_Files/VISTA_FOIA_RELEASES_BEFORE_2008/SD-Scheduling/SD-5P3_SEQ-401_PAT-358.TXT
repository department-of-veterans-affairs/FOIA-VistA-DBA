Subject: VETERANS REPORTS - DISCLAIMER ADDED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 Due to performance issues, two VistA Veterans Reports cannot be
 encapsulated to retrieve appointment data from the remote Scheduling database.
 These 2 reports have been modified to display a disclaimer to the user, stating
 that the reports will not be accurate once the site implements the Resource
 Scheduling Application.  The two VistA Veterans Reports are:
  
 1. Veterans Without Activity Since A Specified Date [SCRPW VETS W/OUT ACTIVITY]
 2. SC Veterans Awaiting Appointments [SCRPW SC VETS AWAITING APPTS]
