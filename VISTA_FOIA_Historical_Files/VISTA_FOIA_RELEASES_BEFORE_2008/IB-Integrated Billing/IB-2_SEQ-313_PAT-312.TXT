Subject: IB PFSS SUNSET

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS)
 project. PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some patch
 functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is activated 
 during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented at select
 pilot sites ONLY.
    
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the VistA environment for
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and
 enhancements to Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (VistA) to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and
 ancillary packages are necessary.
    
 These PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS On/Off
 Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".  The ability for
 the local site to set the switch to "ON" is provided in this patch, 
 IB*2*314. For more information about the PFSS project, review the
 documentation accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:
