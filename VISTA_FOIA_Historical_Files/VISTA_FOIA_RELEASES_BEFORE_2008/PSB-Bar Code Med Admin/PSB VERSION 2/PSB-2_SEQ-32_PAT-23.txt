   Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option from your system. Please complete 
   the ward name conversion process before installing patch PSB*2*23, 
   using the Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option in

   1. Problem: NOIS ISB-0203-31993
   Pro Ra Nata (PRN)
   The PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option displays the date and time 
   that a patch was "Removed," instead of "Given," under the "Admin Time" 
   column. 
  
   Corrective Action: The PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option will 
   display the date and time that a patch is "Given" under the "Admin Time"
   column. 
  
   2. Problem: NOIS ISB-0303-30557
   The PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option displays a PRN medication
   entry twice on the PRN Effectiveness List Report when the user enters a
   Missing Dose Request and administers the medication at a later time.
  
   Corrective Action: The PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option will not 
   display a PRN medication entry twice on the PRN Effectiveness List
   Report when the user enters a Missing Dose Request and administers the
   medication at a later time.
  
   3. Problem: NOIS ISB-0903-31938 
   The Missing Dose Report [PSBO MD] option will display the header "Dosage
   Schedule" on the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Character
   User Interface (CHUI) Missing Dose Report.  This header is not
   consistent with the naming scheme that describes the medication order
   schedule information sent to the Pharmacy via the e-mail notification
   message.
  
   Corrective Action: The Missing Dose Request [PSBO MD] option displays
   the header "Schedule" on the BCMA CHUI Missing Dose Report. This
   information coincides with the BCMA naming scheme that describes the
   medication order schedule information sent to the Pharmacy via the
   e-mail notification message.
  
   4. Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30029
   The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option creates a
   variance entry in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG File (#53.78) when
   the user enters a Missing Dose Request outside the timeframe specified
   for the "Allowable Time Limits" parameter within the Parameters Tab of
   the Graphical User Interface (GUI) BCMA Site Parameters application.
  
   Corrective Action: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST]
   option will not create a variance entry in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE
   LOG File (#53.78) when the user enters a Missing Dose Request outside
   the timeframe specified for the "Allowable Time Limits" parameter within
   the Parameters Tab of the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application.
  
   5. Enhancement: E3R #13009 
   The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option will display 
   the medication order schedule information in the e-mail notification 
   message sent from BCMA to the Pharmacy for a Missing Dose Request.  
  
   6. Enhancement: E3R #17312 
   The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option displays the
