Subject: CLAIMS IN AUTHORIZED STATUS BUT NOT TRANSMITTED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The CBO has requested that these three things be done by this patch. 
 First, it will automatically update the transmission status for certain 
 EDI bills that are authorized but not yet transmitted. Second, the 
 CLAIM MRA STATUS field will be updated to 'NO MRA NEEDED' for authorized 
 bills if there are no MRAs on file. Third, a list will be produced for 
 sites to deal with individually: this list will be of authorized claims  
 with the AR status and the total amount collected.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD191215 Authorized bill report issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Print Authorized Bill [IB BATCH PRINT BILLS] option and
 entering ?? at the Begin Printing Bills prompt, a list of authorized bills
 would display but only a few of them would print to a designated printer. 
  
 Due to a timing issue with the processing of EDI reports, some secondary 
 claims received delayed status messages on the same day as an MRA. The 
 operational issue that led to these delays was resolved the first week of
 April 2007, but affected claims got 'stuck' within VistA and required 
 manual intervention to resolve.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 First, the post-init routine in this patch will update records in the EDI
 TRANSMIT BILL (#364) file setting the TRANSMISSION STATUS (#.03) field to
 "X" for "READY FOR EXTRACT" under the following conditions:
  
  - The BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file STATUS (#.13) field is "AUTHORIZED".
  - The bill has at least one record in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1)
    file where the EOB TYPE (#.04) field is "MEDICARE MRA".
  - There is a record for the bill in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file
    where the CURRENT STATUS (#8) is "ACTIVE" and if there is a record for
    the bill in the AR TRANSACTION (#433) file that the TRANS AMOUNT (#15)
    field has no total amount collected.
  - There is a record in the EDI TRANSMIT BILL (#364) file has the BATCH
    NUMBER (#.02) field empty, and the COB SEQUENCE(#.03) field is "S" for
    "SECONDARY," and the TRANSMISSION STATUS (#.03) field is not already 
    "X" for "READY FOR EXTRACT".
  
 Second, the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file CLAIM MRA STATUS field (#24) will be 
 updated to 'NO MRA NEEDED' for certain authorized bills if there are no  
 MRAs on file. This will resolve the situation where users try to print 
 using Print Bill [IB PRINT BILL] option and receive the "Not Ready for MRA
 Submission, Can Not Print!" message.
  
 Third, a list will be produced of authorized claims other than ones where
 both AR status is ACTIVE and the total amount collected is 0. There is no
 automatic update for this list of claims.
  
 The First and Third lists mentioned above will print to the patch
 installer's screen. You should pass the report to the IB Supervisor 
 (See Installation Instruction #7).
  
 FYI: Those records that are reported will be in XTMP("IB20P375") and you
 may be able to see them again using the INSTALL (#9.7) file or the Install
 File Print option in the Kernel Installation & Distribution System
 and then Utilities menu. The data in the XTMP file is set to be stored for
 thirty days from the day of the patch install.
