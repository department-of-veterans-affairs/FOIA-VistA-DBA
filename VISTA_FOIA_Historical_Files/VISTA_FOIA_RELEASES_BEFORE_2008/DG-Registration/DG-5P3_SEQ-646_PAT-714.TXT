 This patch addresses the issue of Means Test Letters being sent to the
 widows of deceased patients. Means Test Letters are generated when the
 last means test entry for a patient has the STATUS field = REQUIRED, 
 and the PRIMARY INCOME TEST FOR YEAR? field = YES. When a date of 
 death is filed for a patient, this Means Test entry in the ANNUAL MEANS
 TEST File (#408.31) should be deleted so that a Means Test Letter will 
 not be generated.
  
 A cleanup routine will run after patch installation to delete records in 
 the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) that meet the following criteria:
  
 1.  Patient is deceased (has an entry in the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351)
     in the PATIENT File (#2))
  
 2.  The last Means Test entry in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) for 
     the patient has a STATUS field (#.03) = REQUIRED and the PRIMARY
     INCOME TEST FOR YEAR? field (#2) = YES
  
 When the cleanup has finished, a mail message will be sent
 in the following format:

 A trigger was added to the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) in the PATIENT File

 death entry is entered.
