Subject: CORRECT DRUG INTERACTION CROSS REFERENCES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 During the installation of patch PSN*4*107, certain cross references in
 the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) were not properly deleted.  This may
 cause some problems with the installation of data update patch PSN*4*114.
 This patch corrects that problem.
  
 If you have not installed the NDF Data Update patch PSN*4*114, PSN*4*120
 should be installed before PSN*4*114.  In some cases, the PSN*4*114
 install errors because of problems corrected by PSN*4*120.
