 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 
 STC-0503-40076  Problems Scanning
 
 Problem: 
 --------
 
 Record Tracking users are not able to scan bar code labels
 that have a last character of a number for the check digit.
 
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
    
 To correct the scanning problem, routine RTDPA will be modified
 to look for a match if the barcode scanned cannot be found.
 The program will display the possible match with general patient
 information and prompt the user to confirm the match. 
 If the user accepts the match, the program will store the barcode
 information scanned in field 300 OLD BARCODE of RECORDS file (#190)
 for future reference.

  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
  
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
     Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation 
           Load a Distribution 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Install Package(s) 
           Restart Install of Package(s) 
           Unload a Distribution 
           Backup a Transport Global  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RT*2.0*39):
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup

          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RT*2.0*39 .
  
    a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated).
    b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? YES//', answer NO.
  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
