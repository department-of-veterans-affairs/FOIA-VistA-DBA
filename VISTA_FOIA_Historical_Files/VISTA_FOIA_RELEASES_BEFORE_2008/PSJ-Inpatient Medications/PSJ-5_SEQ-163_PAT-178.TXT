Subject: IV LABEL ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 A site reported a problem with the fact that medication route did not 
 appear on the IV label. This patch corrects this problem by adding the 
 medication route to the IV label. PSI-05-107, HD115653
  
 ****Important Note****
 The decision of the workgroup was that the medication route should appear 
 in a larger font than the remaining text. If you do not define the 
 following correctly, the medication route will not be in a larger font. 
 In order to allow this functionality, four new control codes must be set 
 up. They are:
  
 SM          Start Med Route
 EM          End Med Route
 SMF         Start Med Route field
 EMF         End Med Route field
  
 These control codes are defined by using FileMan V. 22.0 and editing the 
 CONTROL CODES multiple (#3.2055) of the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2).
  
 Each printer can have different values required in order to properly
 print the route. Please note that it may be necessary to adjust the
 label length through the SITE PARAMETERS (IV) option in order for the
 label to print correctly.
  
 The following is one example of the setup for a Zebra 105SL printer.
  
 NUMBER: 12                              CTRL CODE ABBREVIATION: SM
   FULL NAME: START MED ROUTE
   CONTROL CODE: W "^FO",PSJBARX,",",PSJBARY,"^A0N,36,30",!!
 NUMBER: 13                              CTRL CODE ABBREVIATION: EM
   FULL NAME: END MED ROUTE              CONTROL CODE: S PSJBARY=PSJBARY+40
 NUMBER: 14                              CTRL CODE ABBREVIATION: SMF
   FULL NAME: START MED ROUTE FIELD      CONTROL CODE: W "^FD"
 NUMBER: 15                              CTRL CODE ABBREVIATION: EMF
   FULL NAME: END MED ROUTE FIELD        CONTROL CODE: W "^FS",!

   ==========================
   HD115653
  
   Problem: Within the pharmacy module, specifically the IV Package, the 
   Route of Administration is NOT appearing on the IV label itself. This 
   has the potential of being a patient safety issue.
  
   Solution: Control Codes for Medication Route must be built using 
   FileMan as described above in order for ROUTE: to appear on the IV 
   labels.
