Subject: SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 THIS PATCH CONTAINS CHANGES TO THE EVENT CAPTURE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
 (GUI) TO MAKE IT SECTION 508 COMPLIANT.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
 Act Amendments of 1998 requires that when Federal agencies develop and
 maintain information technology, they shall ensure that the technology
 allows Federal employees with disabilities to have comparable access as
 Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.
 The Section 508 Accessibility Testing and Training Center (T&TC) was 
 consulted and modifications to the GUI have been made to meet the 
 requirements for 508 Compliance. The Event Capture GUI has been modified 
 to allow screen readers, used by the visually impaired, to accurately 
 interpret information on the screens.  As a result, some buttons and 
 boxes have been moved, replaced or renamed and some screen titles have 
 been modified.  Spreadsheet grids in all screens were replaced with grids 
 that were accessible with the screen readers. -  All screens that 
 contained the Include and Exclude buttons along with their associated 
 list boxes, such as Selected and Available were moved to better 
 accommodate users utilizing only the keyboard.

 While testing is patch, anomalies outside the scope of this patch were 
 discovered.  The following Remedy Tickets were opened to address these 
 anomalies:  (This patch DOES NOT address these new Remedy Tickets)
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Remedy Ticket #HD0000000181229
 Description:  When a procedure is marked Inactive in the Procedure 
 screen, as long as that procedure is active in an Event Code Screen, the 
 procedure can be chosen from the drop down list in data entry, thus it 
 appears to be active.  If the Event Code Screen which contains this 
 procedure is marked Inactive, then the procedure cannot be chosen.  There 
 needs to be an update to the software so that if the procedure is marked 
 Inactive in the Procedure screen, it should then automatically trickle 
 down to mark the Event Code Screen which contains that procedure Inactive 
 so that is no longer available in the pick list.
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181232
 Description:  When adding a new procedure (Add New Procedure screen), if 
 the user enters the name of the Procedure and a Procedure Number, then 
 types a letter in the CPT Code and Description field and uses the mouse 
 to choose a CPT code, sometimes if the CPT code does not reflect the 
 letter typed, an Invalid CPT error message is displayed.  If the user 
 clicks the OK button on the error message and then clicks the OK button 
 on the screen, the procedure is not added and there is no message stating 
 that it was not added.
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181235
 Description: In the Reports section, some fields are not always 
 refreshing, so if the user chooses a patient in the Patient Summary 
 Report screen and then goes to PCE Summary Data Report, that same patient 
 is populated in the Patient Identifier field. 
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181236
 Description:  Same Procedures/Multiple Patients:  On two different days I 
 have added various patient encounters for the same procedure, same date, 
 same diagnosis code.  A number of times today, I have added a patient in 
 this screen then exited the screen, gone back in and added another.  When 
 I go to the View Patients for this Procedure screen, two patients that 
 were added the other day are in the list and only the patient that I have 
 just entered.   The others that were entered today before the latest 
 entry will not be displayed until tomorrow.
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181237
 Description:  Spreadsheet:  F1 key only works for grid when there is data 
 in it.  It does not work for any other field.
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181239
 Description:  Location screen:   When you sort by Current, all of the 
 current locations are sorted to the bottom of the list, not the top as 
 the user would expect.
  
 Remedy Ticket # HD0000000181242
 Description:  In the Multiple/Multiple screen, when one or more provider 
 is chosen, one or more procedure is chosen and a patient is entered on 
 the Patient tab, an Ordering Section is displayed on the Patient tab.  
 When the user enters the first patient, the Ordering section is no longer 
 populated.
