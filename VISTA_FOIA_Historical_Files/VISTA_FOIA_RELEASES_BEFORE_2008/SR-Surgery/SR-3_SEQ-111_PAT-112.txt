Subject: NULLSUBSCR ERROR/DD CHANGE/RACE AND ETHNICITY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. This patch fixes the "NULLSUBSCR" error generated when using the PRINT 
    FILE ENTRIES FileMan option to print one or more of the following
    fields in the SURGERY file (#130) if these fields contain no data:
  
    - OTHER RESPIRATORY OCCURRENCE field (#253)
    - OTHER URINARY TRACT OCCURRENCE field (#286)
    - OTHER CNS OCCURRENCE field (#343)
    - OTHER CARDIAC OCCURRENCE field (#344)
  
 2. This patch adds the description to the Data Dictionary of the
    DEFAULT BLOOD COMPONENT field (#41) in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file
    (#133).
  
 3. When updating a Risk Assessment Status to "COMPLETE", the software
    checks for missing information and provides the ability to update it.
    This option was overlooked when doing the Race & Ethnicity changes
    (patch SR*3*111). This patch removes the current checking for the RACE
    field (#417) in the SURGERY file (#130). 
  
 4. When using the Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT]
    option, there is a possibility of getting an undefined error if the
    length of the race data is found to be more than forty characters.
    This patch fixes this problem.
