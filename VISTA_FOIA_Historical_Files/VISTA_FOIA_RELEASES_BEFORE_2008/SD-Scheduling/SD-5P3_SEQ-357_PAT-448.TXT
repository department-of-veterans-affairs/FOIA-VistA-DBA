Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem where specific institutions cannot be entered 
 at the Select Institution // prompt of four Electronic Wait List

 service/specialty through Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Parameter Enter/Edit, and
 that clinic or service/specialty's PCMM team is associated with that
 specific institution.

     Problem:
     --------
     Specific institutions cannot be entered at the Select Institution //
     prompt of four Electronic Wait List Reports. This happens when a site
     has not set up a specific clinic or service/specialty through Wait
     List (Sch/PCMM) Parameter Enter/Edit, and that clinic or service/
     specialty's PCMM team is associated with that specific institution.
  
     The four reports affected by this problem are:
  
        Appointment (Sch/PCMM) Wait List Report
        Overdue Appointment Wait List(Sch/PCMM) Report
        Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report
        Enrollment Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The applicable routines for each report, SDWLRQ1, SDWLQOF, SDWLQSR
     and SDWLQOI, will be modified to also check the "AINST" cross 
     reference in the PCMM Team file (#404.51) when screening for valid
     selections at the Select Institution prompt.
