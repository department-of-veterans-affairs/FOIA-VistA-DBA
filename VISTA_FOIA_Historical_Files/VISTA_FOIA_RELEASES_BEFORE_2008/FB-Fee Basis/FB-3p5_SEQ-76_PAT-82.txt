Subject: PTF INTERFACE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch modifies the Fee Basis software to use two new PTF (Patient
 Treatment File) APIs when creating or deleting Non-VA PTF records. It also
 corrects a fault that prevented deletion of the Non-VA PTF Record when a
 Community Nursing Home (CNH) authorization was cancelled.

 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1. USE NEW PTF APIS
  
    When certain events occur in Fee Basis, the software attempts to create
    or delete Non-VA PTF records in the Registration package.  Integration
    Agreements (IAs) #226, #993, #994, and #1010 permit this access.  The
    Fee Basis events that can result in the creation or deletion of a
    Non-VA PTF record are listed below:
  
    Note: CH  = Civil Hospital
          CNH = Community Nursing Home

                      7078]
  
    Registration patch DG*5.3*605 added two new application programming 
    interfaces (APIs) for the creation and deletion of Non-VA PTF records.
    These APIs are documented in integration agreement (IA) #4436.
  
    This patch, FB*3.5*82, modifies the Fee Basis software to use the new
    APIs instead of the old method when attempting to create or delete a
    PTF record.
  
  
 2. FIX PROBLEM DELETING PTF RECORD ASSOCIATED WITH CNH ADMISSION
  
    When a patient is admitted to a Community Nursing Home (CNH), the Fee 
    Basis software calls the Registration package to create a Non-VA PTF 
    record with both the date and time of the admission.  If the associated
    7078 authorization is cancelled, the software attempts to delete the
    PTF record.  However, the PTF deletion always fails because only the
    date (without a time) is used to select the PTF record.  The fault was
    discovered during the creation of this patch.
  
    The CNH admission time is not stored with the CNH 7078 authorization.  
    It is only stored in the FEE CNH ACTIVITY (#162.3) file which contains
    the movements (admission, discharge, transfer).  The software requires
    all associated movements to be deleted before a CNH authorization can
    be cancelled so the time is no longer available when a CNH
    authorization is cancelled.
  
    This patch modifies the Fee Basis software so the PTF record deletion 
    will occur when a CNH admission is deleted via the Admission Delete
    [FBCNH DELETE ADMISSION] option instead of when the authorization is
    cancelled with the Cancel Authorization Entered in Error [FBCNH CANCEL
    7078] option.
  
    Note: The local PTF record is not deleted if it has already been
    closed or transmitted to Austin.
