Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project. PFSS patches are being released on various schedules. Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be 
 implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment 
 for the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing
 replacement system, business process improvements, and enhancements 
 to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing replacement system.
 Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and ancillary packages are 
 necessary.
  
 This patch provides the tools needed to send billing data to an external 
 billing system. These tools are executed in the background, so the
 Prosthetics users will not notice any changes to menu options.  This
 patch will not be operational until the PFSS On/Off Switch, distributed 
 with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The ability for the local site to 
 set the switch to "ON" will be provided at the appropriate time with the 
 release of a subsequent Integrated Billing patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/billreplace/.
  
 This patch provides the ability for Prosthetics to electronically send 
 billing related data to the COTS billing system and all the processes
 will be invisible to the Prosthetics users.
  
 The Prosthetics package does not currently support the use of the patient
 Account Number and unique Charge ID that are required by the COTS billing
 system. These two fields will be generated through IBB APIs in the
 background and stored in the Prosthetics files.
  
 In order to run the functionalities that this patch provided, the
 following conditions are required:
 1. PFSS Master Switch has to be turned "ON" at the site, and 
 2. IB patch IB*2.0*286 has to be installed.
  
 The Prosthetics package will ignore any of the PFSS functionalities
 unless the PFSS Master Switch is activated.
