Description:
============

  
  There are three patches that support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation
  Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the
  following order:
                    PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy
                    PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management
                    PSN*4*84       National Drug File
  
  They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to
  implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features. Please
  refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the
  names of the documentation files.
  
  Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail
  for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is
  only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
  directory.  The name of the installation guide is 
  PS_OUTPATIENT_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_IG.PDF.
  
  
  The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to
  ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient
  Pharmacy automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers
  (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is written to HL7
  standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as the Baker APS
  Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to HL7 V. 2.3.1.
  standard using locally developed software.  The automated dispensing
  systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.
  
  This patch includes the following new features:
  1.  Enhance the current National Drug File V. 1.0 package HL7 interface
      to the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.
  
  2.  The interface transmits drug data to multiple vendor systems
      utilized by VAMCs whenever the following options are selected:
      A.  Rematch / Match Single Drugs [PSNDRUG] option.
      B.  Merge National Drug File Data Into Local File [PSNMRG] option.

  Documentation Retrieval: 
  ========================
  The Outpatient Pharmacy User Manual, as well as the Outpatient Pharmacy 
  Technical Manual/Security Guide, have been updated to reflect these 
  modifications. In addition to these two manuals, the following documents 
  have also been revised to reflect the new features provided with the 
  Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface project: 
  
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 Technical Manual/Security Guide, 
         Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 User Manual, 
         Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Automation Interface Installation Guide 
         Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Automation Interface Release Notes 
  
   
  The revised Outpatient Pharmacy Technical Manual/Security Guide, 
  Outpatient Pharmacy User Manual, Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface 
  Installation Guide, and the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface 
  Release Notes are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of 
  the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files need 
  to be retrieved in binary format.  
   
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways: 
  
   (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
   download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first 
   available FTP server.  
   
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
   specific server as follows: 
   
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov 
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov 
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
   
   The documentation distribution includes:
