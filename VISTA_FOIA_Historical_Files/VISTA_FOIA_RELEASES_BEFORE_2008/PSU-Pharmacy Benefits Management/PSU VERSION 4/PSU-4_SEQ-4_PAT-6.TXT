Subject: PRESCRIPTION EXTRACT AND AR/WS AMIS REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the AR/WS AMIS Summary report for the Pharmacy 
 Benefits Management (PBM) Version 4.0 extract in cases where there is no 
 AR/WS data available for the date range of an AR/WS extract.
  
 This patch also corrects the Prescription Extract MailMan messages 
 containing mismatched data elements for partial fill prescriptions.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =========================
 Problem 1: HD111891
 When the PBM Prescription Extract is run, the information contained in 
 the first half of the resulting MailMan message does not match the 
 information contained in the second half of the message.  This happens on 
 isolated prescriptions, and is not observed on every prescription.  
 Specifically Ann Arbor reported that for an insulin prescription, 
 the first half of the message correctly contained information about 
 injectable insulin, but the second half of the message contained dosage 
 information for an unspecified tablet.
  
  
 Solution: The error happens only for partial fill prescriptions. It was 
 corrected by making a call to EN^PSUOPAM in order to gather AMIS data 
 for partial fills in PSUOP2 at AMLOOP+17.
  
  
  
 Problem 2: HD120782, HD120172, HD125152 
 Several sites reported the following error when running the monthly 
 automatic PBM extract: <UNDEFINED>AVE+14~PSUAR6. That line of code 
 contains a reference to PSUAR("UNIT",PSUDV), where PSUDV is undefined.  
 This error occurs when a site has no AR/WS data for a given division 
 during the date range of the extract.
  
 Solution: A check for the existence of PSUDV was inserted at 
 AVE+13~PSUAR6.  If PSUDV is undefined the code is prevented from 
 continuing to execute.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.
  
 **********************NOTE******************************
 It cannot be loaded while the monthly extract is running
 ********************************************************
  
 Installation time will be less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the Routine
     Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSU*4.0*6):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will        
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSU*4.0*6.
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//", respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//", respond NO. 
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
