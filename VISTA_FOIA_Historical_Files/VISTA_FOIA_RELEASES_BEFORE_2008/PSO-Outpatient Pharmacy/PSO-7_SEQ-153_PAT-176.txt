Subject: SCHEDULING REPLACEMENT API - CORRECTION PATCH

Category:

  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem introduced by the Outpatient Pharmacy 
 patch PSO*7*155. 
  
 In the Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option, 
 the print by 'Clinic' function was not working correctly after installing
 the patch PSO*7*155. One of the problems was related to queuing the report
 to the printer. The report would show on the screen instead of the 
 printer. It also resolves the problem "device or file not open" reported
 in NOISs LEB-0404-21298 and NCH-0404-41348. This patch fixes all problems
 introduced by patch PSO*7*155.

 Installation Instructions:     
 ==========================
 Outpatient Pharmacy users can be on the system while installing this
 patch. Installation will take no longer than 2 minutes. There are no
 scheduling restrictions or recommendations.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*176) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*176.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO. 
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned to
    the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
