Description:
============

 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*290 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*290 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*290 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 =========================================
  
 This patch adds support for Laboratory Point of Care (POC) interfaces.
 It utilizes existing functionality provided by Laboratory Universal
 Interface (UI) and Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) software.
 It supports the transmission, processing and storing of POC test results
 in the VistA Laboratory package. The ability of POC interfaces to subscribe
 to VistA HL7 ADT messages for patient demographics and location information
 is provided as needed.
  
  
 NOTE: THIS PATCH WILL BE INSTALLED WITH LA*5.2*67
  
  
 1. Laboratory orders created by this interface will have a CPRS Nature of
 Order 'AUTO' assigned.
  
 2. It creates a 'non-human' user 'LRLAB,POC' in NEW PERSON file (#200)
 which is used to create the order and accession associated with the point
 of care test result. This entry has been approved by the VA VistA Data Base
 Administrator. Local site personnel should assign divisions to this user
 that corresponds to the accession areas used for POC results.
  
 3. Options Summary list (supervisors') [LR SUP SUMMARY] and Summary list
 (extended supervisors') [LRLISTE] have been modified to display the
 performing user, performing laboratory, LOINC code and Equipment Instance
 Identifier (EII) for each test result when the long or extended format is
 chosen. The EII contains the vendor's make/model/serial number of the
 instrument/equipment that produced the test result. When the vendor's
 instrument interface transmits this information, it will be stored with
 the test results.
  
 4. CPRS Lab Display of Recent Results will display performing laboratory
 name and address of tests in accordance with College of American Pathology
 (CAP) requirements. Routine LR7OGMG was modified to add performing
 laboratory information to comments section of the CPRS display.
  
 5. NOIS MAR-0105-20968 reported the CPRS Lab Worksheet did not display the
 external value of 'set of codes' data types. Values that are set of codes
 will be displayed using the external value of the set of codes. Routine
 LR7OGG was modified to return external values of set of codes to CPRS.
