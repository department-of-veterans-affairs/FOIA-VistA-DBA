Subject: BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR NEEDS TO STOP LETTERS.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem associated with the Scheduling/5.3 Package.
 Sites are reporting that patients with bad address indicators are printing
 scheduling letters and would like this practice terminated. In addition, on 
 the SDAM APPT CANCEL Cancel Appointment option, the option prompts for
 printing a cancel appointment letter. This letter was also corrected
 to meet the general standards of letter suppression.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 BAC-0104-40616 - BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR NEEDS TO STOP LETTERS
 
   Problem:
   --------
 Sites are reporting that patients with bad address indicators are printing
 pre-appointment, cancelled clinic, cancelled appointment and no-show letters.
 They requested that this process be corrected to stop printing these letters.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
 A modification is required to the routines that print the pre-appointment,
 cancelled clinic, cancelled appointment and no-show letters to prevent letters
 from printing when the patient has the bad address indicator flag set.
 In addition, a cancel appointment letter can be printed during the
 SDAM APPT CANCEL     Cancel Appointment option and this letter was modified
 to meet the suppression standards of the print scheduling letters option.
 
 
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 BAC-0104-40616 - BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR NEEDS TO STOP LETTERS

 printing pre-appointment, cancelled clinic, cancelled appointment and no-show
 letters. Those routines are:
 
             SDC3     CANCELLATION LETTERS
             SDCNL    CANCELLED APPOINTMENT LETTER
             SDL1     PRE-APPOINTMENT LETTERS

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because  
 some options will be out of service during the installation process,
 it is suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. 
 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes. 
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
    TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
    patch text only].
 
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
    ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
    from the mapped set at this time.
      
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SD*5.3*340)
     
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
        NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
        in the transport global.
    d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
     
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
    SD*5.3*340
     
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    YES//', respond NO
     
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES
  
    When prompted to select the options you would like to place out 
    of order, enter the following:
  
          SDOUTPUT                    Outputs
          SDPRLETTERS                 Print Scheduling Letters
          SD CANCEL APPOINTMENT       Cancel Appointment
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation 
    has run to completion.
