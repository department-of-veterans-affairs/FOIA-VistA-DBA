Subject: ANALGESIC ORDER CHECK FIX

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 Problems and Issues:
 ====================
  
 1. [NTH-0302-72248] 
 Problem: In CPRS order checking there was a cross-reference between the
 Analgesic drug class that was pulling an allergy listing inappropriately
 from one class (Opioid Analgesics) and another (Non-opioid Analgesics).  
 For example, patients with reactions listed for Darvon (Class: CN101)
 triggered an order check when a new prescription was entered for
 Acetaminophen 500mg (Class: CN103).  The order check showed up as:
 "Previous adverse reaction to OPIOID ANALGESICS".  Acetaminophen does not 
 contain opioids and should not have triggered the order check.
  
 Solution: If the ordered drug belongs to the general Analgesics VA drug
 class ("CN10"), it now checks for adverse reactions at the more specific
 5th character.  For example, CN101 will no longer trigger order checks
 against CN103 and vice versa. 
  
 Testing: Follow example scenario outlined above in Problem section before
 and after patch installation.
  
  
 2. This patch adds additional medication order information to order check
 messages.  For example:
 Before patch: BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE AEROSOL,ORAL [PENDING]
 After patch:  BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE AEROSOL,ORAL  42MCG PO Q4H PRN 
               [PENDING]
  
 Testing: Compare the medication order information that appears in 
 order check messages before and after patch installation.
