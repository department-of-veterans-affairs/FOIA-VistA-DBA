     For 5th edition LUNG primaries, if the LYMPH NODES (#165.5,31)
     value was 6 (Hilar,supraclavicular,scalene,cervical), the PATHOLOGIC
     N (#165.5,86) value was being stuffed with "N3 Contralateral

     fixed.

         2.  Cancer Identification
    
     The "stuffing" logic for the above fields has been replaced by
     "default" logic at the users' request.  The "default" logic is
     as follows:
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 0 (Dx here, 1st rx ew)
       REFERRING FACILITY will have a default of NONE
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 1 (Dx here & 1st rx here)
       REFERRING FACILITY and TRANSFER FACILITY will have defaults of NONE
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 2 (Dx ew, 1st rx here)
       TRANSFER FACILITY will have a default of NONE
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 0 (Dx here, 1st rx ew)
                      = 1 (Dx here & 1st rx here)
       DX FACILITY will have a default of the REPORTING HOSPITAL value

     No stage grouping is presently recommended for CORNEA primaries.
     Nevertheless, the package was prompting for TNM values.
    
     This has been fixed.  CORNEA primaries will now be stuffed with the
     appropriate NA values.
     
 13) REASONS FOR NO TREATMENT
    
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       EE Abstract Edit Primary
         4. First Course of Treatment
   
     If the user entered a date at the DATE OF NO TREATMENT (#165.5,124)
     prompt indicating that the patient did not receive any treatment, the
     following fields would be "stuffed" with the "not recommended" value:
    
     #165.5,58 REASON FOR NO SURGERY:         Surgery not recommended
     #165.5,75 REASON FOR NO RADIATION:       Radiation not recommended
     #165.5,76 REASON FOR NO CHEMOTHERAPY:    Chemo not recommended
     #165.5,77 REASON FOR NO HORMONE THERAPY: HT not recommended
     
     The users will now be prompted for the REASON FOR NO treatment fields
     with a default of "not recommended".

     As per ROADS (Registry Operations and Data Standards) pages 122-123,
     descriptions for SIZE OF TUMOR values 000, 998 and 999 have been
     added.  
    
     For all sites: 000 = Not identified
                    999 = Unknown; not recorded; not available
    
     For the following sites the value 998 will have the following
     descriptions:
    
     Site                     998 description 
     ----                     ---------------

     Breast     (C50.0-C50.9) Diffuse; widespread; inflam carcinoma
    
     Also:
     a) The SIZE OF TUMOR field DESCRIPTION has been shortened.
     b) The user may now enter values with leading zeroes.
     c) The output transform appends "mm" to the numeric value.
     d) SIZE OF TUMOR is no longer a "required" field.

 16) PACKAGE (9.4) FILE CORRECTIONS
   
     NOTE: This problem pertains to IRM personnel only.  The problem and
     resolution are transparent to the ONCOLOGY user.
   
     a) The PACKAGE file entry "ONCOLOGY" contains an incorrect PREFIX
        (9.4,1) value of ONCO.  The correct PREFIX value is ONC.
     b) The PACKAGE file entry "OCOLOGY PATCH ONC*2.11*1" contains PATCH
        APPLICATION HISTORY (9.4091,.01) data which belongs in the ONCOLOGY
        entry.
     
     Both of these problems have been fixed.

     a) The EXTENSION list for SEER EOD-88 3rd edition prostate primaries
     contained an incorrect code of 99 for "Unknown if extension or meta-
     stasis".  The correct code is 90.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
     b) When displaying the PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION value for SEER EOD-88
     3rd edition prostate primaries, the program was using the wrong list
     to resolve the PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION code.  It was using the PROSTATE
     GLAND--CLINICAL (3rd edition) list.  It should use the PROSTATE GLAND
     --PATHOLOGIC (3rd edition) list.
   
     This has been fixed.

     When displaying the NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED value, the package was
     resolving the null values (blank values) and "0" values identically.
     In both cases it was resolving these values as "No nodes removed".
     This was inappropriate for null values.  Null values do not require
     resolution.
   
     This has been fixed.

     Renal Pelvis and Ureter sites were not automatically staging correctly.
     e.g. The TNM combination of Ta N0 M0 was staging as A.  The correct
     stage grouping is 0a.
   
     Also, Larynx sites with a stage grouping of IVC were displaying as 4C
     and Testis sites with a stage grouping of IS were displaying as 1S.
