 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. TAM-0403-31795       Companion List for Bar Code Label
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The site reported having trouble with getting the companion
    list for bar code labels to print to a network printer.  It
    was discovered that the variable IOP was not being set
    correctly before attempting to open the device listed in IOP.
    IOP was being set equal to the variable ENEQIO instead of the
    variable ENEQION, which was where the device name was being
    stored.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the code at OPEN^ENLBL9 to set IOP equal to
    ENEQION before attempting to open the device.
