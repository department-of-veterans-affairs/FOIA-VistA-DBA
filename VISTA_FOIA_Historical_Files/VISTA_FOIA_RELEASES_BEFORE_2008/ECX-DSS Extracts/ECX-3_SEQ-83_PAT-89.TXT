Subject: CHANGE EC EXTRACT TO USE PROVIDER API

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is a companion patch to EC*2.0*72. It satisfies one of the Event 
 Capture FY06 requests by Bedford Decision Support Office (DSO) to 'Allow an 
 unlimited number of providers in Event Capture System Data Entry'.
  
 Technical
    o  Previously, the DSS Event Capture extract obtained provider information 
       from PROVIDER (#10), PROVIDER #2 (#15) and PROVIDER #3 (#17) fields from 
       EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT FILE (#721).  EC*2.0*72 created a new provider 
       multiple, PROVIDER MULTIPLE field (#42) which now stores all provider 
       information. DSS extract routine ECXEC was changed to call API 
       $$GETPRV^ECPRVMUT to get the provider instead of reading directly from 
       PROVIDER (#10), PROVIDER #2 (#15) and PROVIDER #3 (#17) fields.
       NOTE: All data stored in PROVIDER (#10), PROVIDER #2 (#15) and 
             PROVIDER #3 (#17) fields were converted to PROVIDER MULTIPLE 
             field (#42).
    o  DBIA1873 was modified to remove reference to provider PROVIDER (#10), 
       PROVIDER #2 (#15) and PROVIDER #3 (#17) fields.
    o  DBIA4460 provides an encounter's providers for Event Capture. DSS was 
       added as a subscriber.
    o  Variables to be killed were added to routines ECKILL and ECKILL1.
    
 Functional
    o  Functionally the user will see no differences in the extract. The extract
       will continue to pull only three providers.
