Subject: RENEWAL/COPY NON-SERVICE CONNECTED COPAY BACK-BILLING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 One site reported an excessive number of prescriptions getting
 automatically (incorrectly) changed at release from Copay to No Copay
 with a reason of "Service Connected". It was determined that this was
 happening because the Service Connected question does not apply for the
 patient anymore, but the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 sends the Service Connected question's answer from the renewed from or
 copied from prescription. For non-service connected veterans, prescription
 fills that were flagged as Service Connected were not charged a copay when
 they should have been.
  
 Solution:
 The post-install job for patch PSO*7*137 identified potential prescription
 fills that should have charged a copay. The starting date for examining
 whether the released fills should have been charged a copay was
 02/04/2002 (the date that the $7 copay amount went into effect). A
 post-install job for this patch will use the global created by patch
 PSO*7*137 to do the back-billing for the identified fills. If the global
 has been removed from the system, the identification portion will be done
 again by the post-install of this patch before doing the back-billing.
  
 A MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: Outpatient Pharmacy Copay
 Clean-up" will be sent to the patch installer and holders of the PSO COPAY
 key indicating the number of fills that were successfully billed. If any
 fills were billed, the MailMan message will contain information on how to
 print a report by patient name of prescription fills that were billed.
  
 Once the back-billing job has completed and you receive this message,
 if any fills were billed please run the routine RPT^PSOCPIB3 from
 programmers mode to generate a detailed report for retention by your
 facility's billing office. This report has a header of Patch PSO*7*123 -
 COPAY PRESCRIPTION FILLS BILLED and will list patient name, last four
 digits of the social security number, division, prescription, fill number,
 and release date. Please produce this report so that your billing office
 will have it as a reference to use if patients should call with questions
 regarding the back-billing. The information needed to generate this report
 will remain on your system for 90 days after the patch is installed, and
 then will automatically be deleted.
  
 After the install of PSO*7*123, sites should review the billed report 
 from the patch with the Held Charges Report [IB OUTPUT HELD CHARGES] 
 option. A comparison will provide information as to which patients have
 current reimbursable insurance for medication. In most cases, sites should
 have already billed the 3rd party insurance carrier for these medications
 based on the original fill date. If the site has received reimbursement 
 for the medications that are on the billed report, then the site should 
 release the medication copayment charge and decrease adjust as 
 appropriate.
  
 We are working on patch PSO*7*142 which will list those patients 
 back-billed with this patch who had prescription insurance as of the fill 
 date of their medication. Reviewing this report will aid you in 
 identifying patients who may need to have their medication copayment 
 charge released. This patch will be available for testing as soon as 
 possible.
  
 A second MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: 'institution' - AAC
 DATA" will be sent to the installer of the patch and back to FORUM to
 some outpatient pharmacy developers. The patch installer does not have to
 do anything with this second message. The information from the message
 sent back to FORUM will be compiled with messages from other sites and
 forwarded to the Austin Automation Center for their use in addressing a
 billing insert for the veterans affected by the back-billing.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
  There are no restrictions on when this patch can be installed. 
  
  Installation should take no longer than 5 minutes. Please do not queue
  the job of installing this patch. There is a post-install background
  job that will prompt for a date@time to run the clean up. You MUST
  respond with a date and time or NOW to queue the post-install job.
  During the installation of the patch, you may not be able to see what
  you are typing when answering the prompt. You will be given an
  opportunity to see what was entered and must confirm the date and time 
  you selected before the clean up job queues.
  
  The post-install job should run fairly quickly if the global from 
  patch PSO*7*137 is still on the system. If not, the post-install 
  could take several hours. If necessary to restart the job, this 
  post-install job can be run again at a later time by calling the
  entry point D ^PSOCPIB3 from programmer mode.
  
  Upon completion of the post-install job, a MailMan message with a subject
  of "Subj: Outpatient Pharmacy Copay Clean-up" will be sent to the
  patch installer and holders of the PSO COPAY key with the number 
  of fills that were successfully billed. If any were billed, the MailMan 
  message will include instructions on how to print a listing of patient
  names and prescription fills that were billed.
  
  Once the back-billing job has completed and you receive this message, 
  if any fills were billed please run the routine RPT^PSOCPIB3 from 
  programmers mode to generate a detailed report for retention by your
  facility's billing office. This report will list patient name, last four
  digits of the social security number, division, prescription, fill
  number, and release date. Please produce this report so that your billing
  office will have it as a reference to use if patients should call with
  questions regarding the back-billing. The information needed to generate
  this report will remain on your system for 90 days after the patch is
  installed, and then will automatically be deleted.
  
  A second MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: 'institution' - AAC
  DATA" will be sent to the installer of the patch and back to FORUM to
  some outpatient pharmacy developers. The patch installer does not have to
  do anything with this second message. The information from the message
  sent back to FORUM will be compiled with messages from other sites and
  forwarded to the Austin Automation Center for their use in addressing a
  billing insert for the veterans affected by the back-billing.
  
  An example of the install process is included here under the title
  "Example Installation".
  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*123)
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
           
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*123.
  
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//" respond NO.
  
   7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. The environment check routine will now prompt the installer of the 
      patch for a date@time to run the post-install job. If no start date 
      and time is entered when prompted, the job will be queued to run NOW.
  
   9. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to completion.
