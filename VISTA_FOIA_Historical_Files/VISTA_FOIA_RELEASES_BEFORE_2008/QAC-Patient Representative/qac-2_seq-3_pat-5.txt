Description: 
============

 This patch deals with several NOIS messages addressing concerns with
 reports and editing of issue codes.  It also deals with the use of
 divisions at integrated sites.
   
   
 There are no E3Rs associated with this patch.  
  
 There are 15 NOIS messages associated with this patch.  
   
 Overview of NOIS messages 
 -------------------------
  
 1.  BRX-1197-10887
 When using the option Customer Service Standards Report [QAC CSS] an
 undefined error occurs.
  
 The routine has been fixed so that the undefined error is not encountered.
  
 2.  CHA-1197-31562
 When calling the Report of Contact using the option Report of Contact [QAC
 RPT], if there is no information for 'Date Due', the fields 'Phone of
 Contact' and 'Info taken by' run together on the report.  
  
 After installation of the patch the fields display properly.
  
 3.  CIH-1097-40152
 An integrated site is not getting the expected prompts pertaining to
 Division.
  
 The logic for establishing whether or not a site needs to have the
 division field included in the list of prompts when entering or editing a
 Report of Contact has been changed.  Instead of checking the site's entry
 in the facility type file, IRM will be asked to answer some questions and
 make entries in the QUALITY ASSURANCE SITE PARAMTER FILE (#740).  (See
 Installation Instructions for example of questions to be answered.)
  
 4.  DUB-1197-30370/NAS-1097-30497/NCH-0198-40521
 If an issue code is entered in error while using option Enter New Contact
 [QAC NEW] or Edit Contact Record [QAC EDIT] it cannot be deleted.  Another
 code may be added to the contact, but the error cannot be removed.
  
 The enter/edit process has been altered to allow deletion of issue codes
 from the Report of Contact.
  
 5.  LOM-1197-60643
 The report Service/Discipline Issue Totals [QAC SERV/DISC ISSUE TOT] is
 giving figures identical to the Discipline Issue Totals.
  
 The report now looks at the Service/Discipline field, rather than the
 Discipline field.
  
 6.  MRN-1097-40995
 User cannot delete a service/discipline from a Report of Contact if
 entered in error using Enter New Contact [QAC NEW] or Edit Contact Record
 [QAC EDIT].
  
 The enter/edit process has been altered to allow the deletion of
 service/disciplines from the Report of Contact.
  
 7.  NAS-1097-31738/GNH-0198-41861/LOM-0198-60733/MCM-1097-51848
     BRX-1197-10887
 When report Customer Service Standards Report [QAC CSS] is queued, a bad
 syntax error occurs.
  
 The routine has been corrected so the error no longer occurs on
 printing, and the undefined QAQA2HED problem has also been fixed.
  
 8.  STL-1097-42610
 Users are unable to add new Service/Disciplines using the option Add new
 Service/Discipline [QAC NEW SERV].
  
 LAYGO has been added for the QAC SERVICE/DISCIPLINE FILE(#745.55).
  
 9.  BYN-0198-11272
 Users are unable to pull Persian Gulf vets from the CONSUMER CONTACT file
 (#745.1).
  
 The Persian Gulf Service field has been added to the ad hoc reports.
  
  
 This patch also addresses an issue identified by the Office Director.
 Reports of Contact should not have a Resolution Date entered at the time
 the Contact is referred to SEAT. The Contact should remain open until it
 is resolved by SEAT.  In the enter/edit process (options Enter New Contact
 [QAC NEW] and Edit Contact Record [QAC EDIT]) after this patch there will
 be some additional prompts.  If a Contact is referred to SEAT there will
 follow a prompt "Resolved by SEAT?". If the response is "NO" the user will
 not see the prompts for "Level of Satisfaction" or "Resolution Date". If
 the response is "YES" the user must enter "SEAT Resolution Comments". Once
 the "SEAT Resolution Comments" have been entered the "Level of
 Satisfaction" and "Resolution Date" prompts will appear.
  
 This patch has a pre-install routine (QAC5PRE) that changes the wording of
 one Issue Code (TI05), and adds a new Discipline (Extended Care).  Once
 these changes have been verified the routine may be deleted from the
 system.
  
 This patch should be installed during off-hours.  
              
 If installed during the normal work day with Patient Representative users
 on the system, it is recommended that the following menu option (File #19)
 and all of it's descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts
 while unpacking the routines:
            
        [QAC MAIN MENU]  Patient Representative Manager Menu
   
  NOTE: This will be done during Step 5 of the INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
             
  
  Estimated installation time to install patch:   5 minutes 
            
     
     
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

 FileMan, and choose the Enter/Edit option.  An example of this follows:
