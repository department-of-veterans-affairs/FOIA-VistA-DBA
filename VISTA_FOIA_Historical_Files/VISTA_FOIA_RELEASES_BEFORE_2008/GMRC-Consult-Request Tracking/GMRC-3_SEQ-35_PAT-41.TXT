Subject: CONSULT PERFORMANCE MONITOR

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The completion of consults within CPRS is critical to effective 
 communication between the requesting clinician and the consultant.  The 
 timeliness of this communication also impacts the overall satisfaction of 
 our veteran patients as related to communication of test or consultation 
 results.  A delay in the completion and/or communication of consultation 
 results has a potentially negative impact on the provision of timely and 
 safe healthcare to the veteran patient.  
  
 In an effort to improve the processes related to timely transmission of
 consult results, a monitor of consult completion is included in this
 patch. The consult monitor is a report that may be run at a local level
 such that data requested for the national performance monitor can be
 gathered and reported.
  
  
  IMPORTANT NOTE:
  ===============
  Any Consult service that appears as part of the Consult service hierarchy
  in more than one place (i.e. a sub-service of more than one parent) has
  the potential to cause skewed totals for the new Consult Performance
  Monitor report and all other Consult/Request Tracking reports. Due to the
  necessity to report activity and completion statistics for a national
  performance monitor, sites are once again being advised that duplicate
  sub-services are discouraged. The option Duplicate Sub-Service [GMRC
  DUPLICATE SUB-SERVICE] can be used to determine if your site has
  duplicate sub-services. If duplicates are found they should be corrected
  so that the totals reported for the Consult Performance Monitor are as
  accurate as possible.
  
  
 Components included:
  
  Option:
  =======
  Consult Performance Monitor Report [GMRC RPT PERF MONITOR]
  
  This new option will be attached to the Consult Tracking Reports ... 
  [GMRC REPORTS] menu.
  
   DOCUMENTATION:
   ==============
   The Technical Manual for Consult/Request Tracking has been updated to
   reflect the enhancements provided by this patch.
   
   The following documentation (.PDF) file can be retrieved in BINARY
   format by FTP:
    
     CONSTM.PDF

  PRE-INSTALL:
  ============
  This patch includes a pre-install routine (PRE^GMRCYP41) that will 
  delete three cross-references on the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) 
  file. The deleted cross references are the "AE", "AE1" and "AE2". These 
  MUMPS style cross references are quite inefficient in indexing the data 
  and have shown the potential to become errant. These three cross-
  references will be replaced by a new-style index during a post-install.
  This new index will have exactly the same format as the original "AE"
  cross-reference, but will provide greater efficiency and reliability.
  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be done 
  at off-peak hours.  Installation should take less than one minute.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*41):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        GMRC*3.0*41.
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? YES//' respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//' respond NO.
   8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
         
         Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': GMRC REPORTS 
         Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': GMRC RPT*
  
         Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': 
  
         Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': 
  
         Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0// 
   9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
  
  
  POST-INSTALL:
  =============
  A post install routine POST^GMRCYP41 is included in this patch. This 
  post-install will install a new style index ("AE") on the 
  REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file. This index will replace the "AE", "AE1"
  and "AE2" MUMPS style cross references deleted in the pre-install. This 
  will force a re-index of the "AE" cross-reference on the file. The 
  length of time required for the post-isntall to run is relative to the 
  number of entries in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file.
