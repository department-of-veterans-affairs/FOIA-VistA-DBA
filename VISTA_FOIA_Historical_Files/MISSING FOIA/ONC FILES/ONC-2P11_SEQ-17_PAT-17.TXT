Description: 
============

 Patch 17 will do the following:
    
 1) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          AI Complete Abstract  [ONCO ABSTRACT-ENTER/EDIT]
    Fixes a problem in which the default value for the RACE field (#8) in
    the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (#160) may be set incorrectly.  This problem
    was reported in FORUM message #26453833, and NOIS #CMO-0398-41306.
    
 2) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]
    Fixes a typo in one of the new surgery codes.  This problem was reported
    in FORUM message #26522667.
    
 3) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]
    Fixes a problem in the TNM staging where the program would error
    out due to an undefined line label.  This was caused by a typo in
    the line label.  This problem was reported in FORUM message #26698061,
    and NOIS #WRJ-0498-11351
    
 4) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...  [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
         PF     Post/Edit Follow-up    [ONCO FOLLOWUP-POST/EDIT]
    Adds a new field called STATE DEATH CERT (#19.1) to ONCOLOGY PATIENT
    file (#160).  This was added because in the ICD CAUSE OF DEATH field
    (#19) there were 2 codes missing.  However, the ICD CAUSE OF DEATH field
    points to the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80), and we are not allowed to add
    new codes to this file.  Therefore we added the new field (#19.1).  To
    use the 2 new codes, the ICD CAUSE OF DEATH field will be left blank and
    the new field will be filled in with one of the new codes.  The 2 new
    codes, which are the ONLY available choices for the new field (#19.1) are:
          7777 - State death certificate or listing not available
          7797 - State death cert available, cause of death not coded
    This problem was reported in FORUM message #26698480.
    
 5) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]
    FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...  [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
          PF     Post/Edit Follow-up    [ONCO FOLLOWUP-POST/EDIT]
    Fixes a problem in which the abstract would error out when jumping
    to Surgery fields.  This problem occurred under the First Course of
    Treatment and also in the Followup Recurrence.  This problem was
    reported in FORUM message #26731371.
    
 6) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]

    ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) was not computing the correct value.
    This problem was reported in FORUM message #26741542.
    
 7) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ... [ONCO ABSTRACT MENU]
          EE Abstract Edit Primary      [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]

    date.  This problem was reported in FORUM message #26841120.
