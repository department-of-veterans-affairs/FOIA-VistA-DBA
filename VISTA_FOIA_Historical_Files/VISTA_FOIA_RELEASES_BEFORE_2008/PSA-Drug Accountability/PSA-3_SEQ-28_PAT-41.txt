  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
 ******************************* N O T E *******************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
 problems.
 ***********************************************************************
       DO NOT QUEUE THE INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH.
  
  The GUI can be installed at anytime prior to attempting to upload
  invoice data received from the prime vendor (McKesson).
  
  A pre-install routine should be scheduled to run after the last
  Amerisource invoice has been uploaded and before any McKesson data
  is uploaded. This utility removes any Amerisource vendor stock
  numbers that may be in the DRUG (#50) file. This is done to avoid
  possible mis-matches with the new vendor data.
  
  All Drug Accountability users must be off the system during install.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*41).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3.0*41.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  GUI INSTALLATION
  ----------------
  1. Copy the PSA_MCKESSON_UPLOAD.EXE to the PC that will be used to place 
  orders with the prime vendor.
  
  2. Create a shortcut on the PC's desktop.
