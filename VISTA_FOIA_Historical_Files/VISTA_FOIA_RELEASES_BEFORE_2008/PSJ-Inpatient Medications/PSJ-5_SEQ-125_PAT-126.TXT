 NOIS OVERVIEW
 -------------
  
 1.    MAC-0704-61828   Undefined in PSGPLXR
  
       Problem:
       --------
       User has intermittently received a null subscript error
       when running a unit dose pick list.  The reason is not
       clear from the errors generated but a previous NOIS states
       the error is generated when trying to queue a pick list that
       was exited ungracefully.  The user is not able to duplicate
       the error but it is apparent in the code that a safeguard 
       must be added to eliminate a hard error.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       PSGPLXR has been modified to safeguard against a hard error
       occurring when a pick list is run.
  
 2.    CLE-0604-40092   Misspelled name in parameters
  
       Problem:
       --------
       The word 'DOMICILIARY' contained in the set of codes in
       file #59.723 and #59.7231 is misspelled.  This is found
       when user accesses PSJI Site Parameters.
  
       Resolution
       ----------
       The misspelling in the two different fields will is
       corrected in this patch.
