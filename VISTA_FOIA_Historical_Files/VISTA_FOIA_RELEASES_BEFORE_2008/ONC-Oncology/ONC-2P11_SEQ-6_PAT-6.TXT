Description: 
============

 These are the items addressed in patch 6 (ONC*2.11*6):
    
  1) In the "AI" or "EE" options, under the "ABS" menu, the algorithm for
     computing FIRST COURSE DATE (165.5,49) has been modified as follows:
    
     If there is an actual treatment date (not 00/00/00 or 99/99/99), FIRST 
     COURSE DATE will equal the earliest treatment date.
    
     If there are no actual dates, only 00/00/00 and/or 99/99/99 dates,
     FIRST COURSE DATE will equal 00/00/00.
    
     If all treatment dates are 99/99/99, FIRST COURSE DATE will equal 
     99/99/99.
    
     As per FORUM message [#21005503]
    
  2) In the "AI" or "EE" options, under the "ABS" menu, the stuffing logic
     for RADIATON THERAPY TO CNS DATE (165.5,52) has been modified as follows:
    
     If RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS = 8
        RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS DATE = 99/99/99.
    
     If RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS = 9 AND it is a lung or leukemia case,
        RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS DATE = 99/99/99.
    
     If RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS = 9 AND it is NOT a lung or leukemia case,
        RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS DATE = 00/00/00.
    
     The existing data will be converted to be in agreement with the above
     logic.
    
     As per FORUM message [#21005503]
    
  3) In order to be consistent with the ROADS manual the following field
     names in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (165.5) have been changed:
    
     Old Name             New Name                   Field # 
     --------             --------                   -------
     GRADE                GRADE/DIFFERENTIATION       (24)
     SIZE/DEPTH (MM)      SIZE OF TUMOR (MM)          (29)
     NODES POSITIVE       NODES POSITIVE (REGIONAL)   (32)
     NODES EXAMINED       NODES EXAMINED (REGIONAL)   (33)
    
  4) In the "CC" option, under the "UTL" menu, the state reporting routine
     was extracting NON CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY (165.5,58.1) codes instead
     of CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY (165.5,58.2) codes.  This has been fixed.
    
  5) The patch number has been appended to the version number on the 
     Oncology login banner. (e.g. V2.11P6)
    
  6) PCEs for the Thyroid and Soft Tissue Sarcoma have been added.  The
     Bladder PCE has been redesigned.
    
     This patch will also add a Prostate PCE.  The Prostate PCE will be
     for VA use ONLY.
     
     The PCE's are located in the "AI" option, under the "ABS" menu.
     
  7) The following sequence number problem has been fixed.  If the user
     enters "02" and there are no previous malignant primaries, an "undefined"
     error occurs.  This error also occurs if the user enters "BB" and there
     are no previous benign primaries.  Also, if there are no previous
     malignant primaries, the default was "0" which was incorrect.  The
     default should be "00".  This is under the "AI" option of the "ABS" menu.
   
  8) In the "AI" option, under the "ABS" menu, an edit check on the ABSTRACT
     STATUS (165.5,91) field has beed added:
   
     If CLASS OF CASE (165.5,.04) = 0, 1 or 2 AND
        SEQUENCE NO. (165.5,.06) is NUMERIC AND
        DATE DX (165.5,3) is after 12/31/95,
     then ABSTRACT STATUS cannot be set to 3 (Complete) unless all required
     fields are filled in.
   
     If these conditions are met and required fields are NOT filled in, 
     a list of the fields that are not filled in will be displayed.
   
  9) The "Enter/Edit ACOS Number file" option on the "Utility Options" menu
     has been modified.  If the user wants to add a new local entry they
     will now be shown the next available ACOS ID number.
     Also, advanced HELP for adding new entries to the ACOS NUMBER (160.19)
     file through the abstract edit template has been added.  In the "AI"
     option, under the "ABS" menu, the user may enter a "?" or an institution
     name that does not exist in the ACOS NUMBER file, at any field which
     points to file #160.19 (DX FACILITY, TRANSFER FACILITY, REFERRING
     FACILITY, CHEMOTHERAPY HOSPITAL, RADIATION THERAPY HOSPITAL, etc.)
     and a message will be displayed that will show the next available local 
     ACOS ID number.
   
 10) In the "AI" option, under the "ABS" menu, the acceptable values for
     the sequence number of the FIRST primary for a patient has been changed,
     per 8/28/96 conference call.  When entering the sequence number for the
     FIRST primary for a patient, previously it ONLY accepted 00,01 or 99 (or
     AA,BB, or XX for benign primaries).  Now it will accept other numeric
     values for the first primary (for example '03'), or alphabetic values
     where the first character and the second character are the same (for
     example 'DD', or 'EE').
    
 11) The word "Stage" has been removed from the output transform of the
     CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (165.5,38) field.  Also, the CLINICAL STAGE GROUP
     code of 99 now equals "Unknown", and additional help has been added.
    
 12) The MANAGING PHYSICIAN and FOLLOWING PHYSICIAN field names have been
     swapped.
   
 13) This patch will also fix NOIS BRK-0896-10708.  The site was getting an
     undefined variable 'C' at IV^ONCOTNC when using the "CPR" option, under
     the "ANN" menu, to generate a report.
   
 14) The printing of PCE data can now be done in two different ways.  When
     printing an abstract through the "PA" [Print Complete Abstract] option,
     under the "ABS" menu, it will also print PCE data (if any) associated
     with the primary.  It will append any PCE data to the end of this report.
   
     In addition to printing PCE data for a particular abstract at the end 
     of the above report, it is also possible to print ALL PCE data for a
     given site.  Under the "MA" [Print QA/Multiple Abstracts] option, also
     under the "ABS" menu, there is now a new selection "Print PCE Data".
     If selected, it will allow the user to pick a site for which PCE data
     is available (currently Bladder, Prostate, Thyroid and Soft Tissue
     Sarcoma), and print all the PCE's of that type.
   
 15) Pathologic Staging fields have been added in this patch.  These are
     located when editing an abstract in the "AI" or "EE" options, under
     the "ABS" menu.
   
 16) With the addition of Pathologic Staging fields, the Annual Summary
     Report, located in the "RS" option, under the "UTL" menu needed to be
     changed.  In order to assure that the most definitive Stage Grouping
     is reflected in this report, the criteria for selecting which Stage
     Group will be used (Clinical or Pathologic), was modified per FORUM
     message # [1787458], responses #33 and #37.
   
 17) This patch also addresses NOIS WAS-1096-22787.  This NOIS was 
     regarding a missing ICDO code from the Histology lexicon.  The
     entry "CYSTADENOMA SEROUS BORDERLINE MALIG" was added to the
     ICDO MORPHOLOGY (#164.1) file.
    
 18) This patch also addresses NOIS NAS-1096-31773 and NOIS MAN-1096-12840.
     The "Annual Primary Site/Stage/Tx (132c)" report, located under the
     "ANN" menu was aborting if no records were found which satisfied the
     sort criteria.
