This patch contains the second quarter enhancements for the Pharmacy Data 
"BLD",6235,1,2,0)
Management V 1.0 package.  The following data dictionary additions are
"BLD",6235,1,3,0)
included for PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) and supports modifications made 
"BLD",6235,1,4,0)
in Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*200.

1.  SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING multiple (#47) - adds the capability 
"BLD",6235,1,7,0)
to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy label printer(s) to 
"BLD",6235,1,8,0)
control where the ScripTalk labels print for multi-divisions.  Multiple 
"BLD",6235,1,9,0)
print devices may be mapped to a ScripTalk printer, and any device 
"BLD",6235,1,10,0)
defined must have a subtype prefixed with "P-".  This prefix in the 
"BLD",6235,1,11,0)
subtype indicates that the device is a printer.  If no data is defined in
"BLD",6235,1,12,0)
this multiple, the ScripTalk printer tied to the division will be used.  
"BLD",6235,1,13,0)
The use of this multiple builds upon existing ScripTalk functionality, so
"BLD",6235,1,14,0)
a divisional ScripTalk device must be defined for the mapped device
"BLD",6235,1,15,0)
functionality to work properly and to have a default device defined.

    a.  LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED field (#.01) -  This field contains 
"BLD",6235,1,18,0)

"BLD",6235,1,19,0)
the printer device defined in this field is selected as the Pharmacy 
"BLD",6235,1,20,0)
print device by the user, ScripTalk labels will print on the 
"BLD",6235,1,21,0)
corresponding mapped ScripTalk device.
"BLD",6235,1,22,0)
 
"BLD",6235,1,23,0)

"BLD",6235,1,24,0)
print device that will be tied to regular Pharmacy label device(s) 
"BLD",6235,1,25,0)
defined in the "LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED" field.
