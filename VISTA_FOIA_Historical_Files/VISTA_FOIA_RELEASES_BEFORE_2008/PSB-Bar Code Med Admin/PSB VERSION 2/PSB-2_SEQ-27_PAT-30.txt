Description:
============

  *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
  executable file. Installation of this GUI is NOT required immediately after 
  the KIDS install for the Patch to function. ***
  
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
 Patch PSB*2*30 presents some changes to the 'look and feel' of the Bar  
 Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI. One change is the additive and
 solution display automatically for an infusing bag in the IV chronology 
 section of the Virtual Due List (VDL).  Another change is during the 
 administration of a Pro Re Nata (PRN) the PRN reason may be selected by 
 typing the first letter of the PRN Reason.  BCMA will focus on the PRN 
 Reasons that start with the first letter typed in the PRN Reason selection
 area.
  
  
 1.     Problem: NOIS CPH-0703-40060
        When an IV medication order becomes expired while an IV bag is 
        "INFUSING" or "STOPPED," the un-administered bags of that order are
        still "available" for administration. 
  
        Corrective Action:
        When an IV medication order expires, the un-administered IV bags 
        will not display on the BCMA VDL.
  
  
 2.     Problem: NOIS RIC-0703-20366
        The "Scanner Status:" indicator on the BCMA VDL displays red when the 
        user switches from another application back to the BCMA GUI.
  
        Corrective Action:
        The BCMA VDL Scanner Status indicator will display green when it is 
        possible to scan medication using BCMA. 
  
  
 3.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0303-31005
        Multiple IV bags of an order may be "INFUSING" simultaneously.  
        BCMA does not allow proper maintenance of any of these 
        administered IV bags.  For example the user cannot "COMPLETE" any 
        of the "INFUSING" IV bags.
  
        Corrective Action:
        BCMA will allow the maintenance of an order with multiple "INFUSING" 
        IV bags.
  
  
 4.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-31029
        If the BCMA GUI user enters a space alone as documentation of PRN 
        Effectiveness, an "information box" displays because the space is 
        inappropriately treated as a special character.     
  
        Corrective Action:
        When documenting PRN Effectiveness using the BCMA GUI via a lone 
        space character, the lone space will not be treated as a special 
        character; instead the user will be asked to re-enter the data.
  
  
 5.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30373
        The user must scroll the list of output devices to select the most 
        recently used print device.
  
        Corrective Action:
        The print device most recently selected by the user will display 
        first in the list of selectable print devices.
  
  
 6.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30480
        Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application, the user can 
        seemingly create an unlimited number of entries for a "Default Answer
        List" such as the BCMA "Injection Site" list .  These entries should 
        then be selectable from the respective list box during certain 
        medication administration using the BCMA GUI.  Without notice to the 
        user, BCMA limits the number of entries/selections to 60.
  
        Corrective Action:
        Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application, the user will be able 
        to create up to 100 entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" list box. 
        Therefore it will be possible for the user to have up to 100 entries 
        to select from the respective BCMA GUI list box.
  
  
 7.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30478
        Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application the user can seemingly 
        create entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" box, such as the 
        BCMA "Injection Site" list, longer than 30 characters.  Without 
        notice to the user, BCMA limits the number of characters for a list 
        entry to 30.
  
        Corrective Action:
        Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application the user will not be
        able to create entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" more than 30 
        characters in length.
  
  
 8.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30290
        Using the BCMA GUI, the user cannot submit a Missing Dose Request 
        for a medication patch order when another patch from that order 
        displays a status of "GIVEN" on the VDL.
  
        Corrective Action:
        BCMA will allow the user to submit a Missing Dose Request for a 
        medication patch order when another patch from that order displays a 
        status of "GIVEN" on the VDL.
  
  
 9.     Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-31421
        When the user submits a Missing Dose Request for a PRN medication and 
        immediately (without refreshing the BCMA VDL) marks that PRN as 
        "GIVEN," BCMA files into the BCMA Medication Log a null value as the 
        PRN Reason.
  
        Corrective Action:
        BCMA will file into the BCMA Medication Log the PRN Reason as selected 
        by the user for the respective PRN administration.
  
  
 10.    Problem: NOIS SDC-0803-60738
        When a Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN) bar code was 
        scanned, BCMA would strip out the National Drug Code (NDC) number from 
        the GTIN and perform a search on it. This would result in BCMA not   
        finding a match and displaying the error message "Invalid Medication
        Lookup. DO NOT GIVE!!"
  
        Corrective Action: 
        The logic that performs the lookup has been modified to not strip
        out the NDC number.       
  
 11.    Enhancement: E3R#18328
        BCMA GUI will allow a medication patch to be marked as "HELD" or 
        "REFUSED" while another patch from the same order displays as "GIVEN" 
        and not marked "REMOVED."
  
  
 12.    Enhancement: E3R#13940
        BCMA GUI will provide the user access to the BCMA Medication Variance 
        Log Report from the Reports menu of the VDL.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions: 
 ====================================
 Sites can retrieve VISTA documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from

      available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
