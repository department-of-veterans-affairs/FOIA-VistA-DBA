 Patch XM*8.0*3
 
 1.  NOIS: LAS-0802-62501
 Test Site:  Las Vegas, NV
 The communications testing routine, XMCDNT, distributed with MailMan 8.0
 was an old version which does not work.  This patch provides a version
 that works.
 
 2.  This patch also adds a new field to the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS (#4.3)
 file.  You should fill it in with the DEVICE you normally use for your
 TCP/IP scripts in DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  With the addition of this new field,
 it is now possible to distribute new domains automatically, rather than
 having you enter them manually.  Here's the new field:

            HELP-PROMPT:      Which device shall be used for TCP/IP?
            DESCRIPTION:      For TCP/IP connections, the physical
                              link/device to be used is usually standard -
                              some sort of NULL device.  This field is a
                              free-text pointer to that device in the DEVICE
                              (#3.5) file.
 
                              The device pointed to by this field will be
                              used for a TCP/IP connection if, in the DOMAIN
                              (#4.2) file, the device field is null in both
                              of the following fields:
                               - PHYSICAL LINK / DEVICE (#1.3) field of the
                              TRANSMISSION SCRIPT (#4) multiple
                               - PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE (#17) field
 
                              For more information, see the PHYSICAL LINK
                              DEVICE (#17) field, in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.
 
            NOTES:            XXXX--CAN'T BE ALTERED EXCEPT BY PROGRAMMER
 
 3.  Finally, this patch corrects the descriptions in two fields:
 - MAIL GROUP (#3.8) file, MEMBER GROUPS (#11) field - invalid information
 deleted
 - DOMAIN (#4.2) file, PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE (#17) field - information about
 default values corrected
 
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
 is at a minimum.  It has no patch prerequisites, except, of course, that
 MailMan 8.0 be installed.  Installation will take less than 1 minute.
