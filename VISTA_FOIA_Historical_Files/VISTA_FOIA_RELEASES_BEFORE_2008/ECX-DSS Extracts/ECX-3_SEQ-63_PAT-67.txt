 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. SPO-1203-52420     Review Extract for Transmision Not Working
    
    Problem:
    --------
    After transmitting extracts to the AAC and the confirmation messages
    are received, the Review a Particular Extract for Transmission [ECX
    EXTRACT LOG REVIEW] option was used to look for any unconfirmed 
    messages. But the Report showed unconfirmed counts that indicated 
    that not all the confirmed messages were counted. 
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The issue is not with the Review a Particular Extract for Transmission 
    [ECX EXTRACT LOG REVIEW] option but with the routine ECXMDELE that
    processes the confirmations from the AAC. It has been modified to use
    the correct data (piece) from the extract file to screen messages, to
    find and correctly process the confirmation messages from the AAC.
    The data in question was expanded and this routine needed to be updated
    to accommodate this change to the new data structure.

 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system. Installation time
 will be less than 2 minutes.
    
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
    
      NOTE: If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...

           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global

          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
    
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      ECX*3*67.
