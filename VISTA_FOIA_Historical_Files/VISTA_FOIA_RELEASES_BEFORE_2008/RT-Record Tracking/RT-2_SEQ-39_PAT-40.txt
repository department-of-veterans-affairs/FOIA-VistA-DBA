 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HAM-0603-20357   Addition of new institutions
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Fileroom personnel are currently able to add new institutions when 
    using the option [Transfer Record to another Institution ]. When 
    users are able to add new institutions, incomplete institution
    records can be created.This should not be allowed, one reason being 
    the fact that the INSTITUTION file should be synchronized with 
    the National Institution project.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Laygo (add a new entry) parameter should be removed from the fileman 
    call that prompts for the institution. This change will prevent users 
    from entering incomplete institution records.
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 The line tag TFR in the routine RTSYS should be modified to remove the 
 "L" from the list of parameters set for the ^DIC call to the institution 
 file.
