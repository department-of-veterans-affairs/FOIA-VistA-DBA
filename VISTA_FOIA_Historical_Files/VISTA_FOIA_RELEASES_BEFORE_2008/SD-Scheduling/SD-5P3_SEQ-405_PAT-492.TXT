 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There are appointments for the same patient, at the same time, in PCE 
    (clinic view) at the same clinic.  The appointments have one entry
    checked out and one entry requiring action. The action required entry
    cannot be cancelled.  If the patient view is displayed, there is only
    one appointment for the patient.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Fix the view / report by clinic to not display duplicate appointments.
