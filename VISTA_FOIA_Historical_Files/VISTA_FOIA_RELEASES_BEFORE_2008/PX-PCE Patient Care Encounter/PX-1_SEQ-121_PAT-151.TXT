============

 ******                         A L E R T                             ******
   Prior to installing the host file, it is strongly recommended that sites
   run the following reports -
     SD CLN STOP CODE REP...   Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report
     ECX CLN STOP REP...       DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report
   
   Run the reports, selecting the Active Clinics.  It is highly recommended
   that all non-conforming clinics be corrected prior to installing the host
   file.  Although it is not absolutely necessary to correct these clinics
   before installation, use of clinics with non-conforming stop codes will
   not be permitted after the installation.

 Introduction
 ============
 The Deputy Director of Health Administration Center (HAC) DSS, requested
 enhancements to VistA to implement an electronic means of restricting
 medical centers from entering secondary DSS stop codes, also known as
 DSS Identifiers, in the primary DSS stop code position and to prevent
 stations from using stop codes in the secondary position that should be
 primary only.
   
   
 Technical
 ---------
 Patient Care Encounter application was modified to check the clinic 
 associated with an encounter to ensure that its corresponding stop pairs 
 conform to the stop code restriction.  The following components were 
 affected:-
 o  Routines PXBAPI1, PXCEVSIT and PXCE were modified to call API, 
    $$CLNCK^SDUTL2 which checks to ensure a clinic has a valid stop 
    code pairs in accordance with restriction type.
 o  PCE was added as a subscriber to IA#4652 to use API $$CLNCK^SDUTL2.
   
     
 Functional
 ----------
 The following options were affected by the restricting stop code project.
 Users will not be able to select clinics with non-conforming stop codes.
 
   PCE Encounter Data Entry and Delete  [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE]
   PCE Encounter Data Entry without Delete  [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO DELETE]
   PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor  [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER]
   PCE Encounter Data Entry  [PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY]
       Action:   AD  Add Standalone Enc.
