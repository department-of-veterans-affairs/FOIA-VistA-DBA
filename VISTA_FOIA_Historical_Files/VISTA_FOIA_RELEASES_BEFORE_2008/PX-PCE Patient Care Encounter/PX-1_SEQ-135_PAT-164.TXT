Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS)
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing
 patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Overview
 --------
 Patient Care Encounter(PCE) has been identified by the Patient Financial
 Services System(PFSS) as one of the systems that needs to be modified in
 order to send charge data to the COTS billing replacement system.  The
 patch PX*1.0*164 represents the PCE portion of the PFSS effort to Revenue
 Improvement.
   
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 Modifications to the Veterans Health Administration(VHA) Information
 Systems and Technology Architecture Patient Care Encounter have been made
 such that the COTS billing replacement system may receive charge messages
 based on encounter data.  The modifications include:
  
 * No attempt will be made to create a PFSS Account Reference when the
   PCE Visit Date is prior to the PFSS Effective Date.
  
 * No attempt will be made to place charge records into the Integrated
   Billing subsystem (IBB) cache buffer when the PCE Visit Date is
   prior to the PFSS Effective Date.
   
 * Accept the PFSS Account Reference as a new field in the
   VISIT file (#9000010).
  
 * Determine if there is a PFSS Account Reference available either by
   being passed-in with a DATA2PCE API call, or by association with a
   scheduled appointment, or through association with an order.
  
 * If no PFSS Account Reference is available, call the Integrated
   Billing subsystem(IBB) Get Account API to create a new PFSS
   Account Reference.
  
 * Add a PFSS Charge ID field to the V CPT file (#9000010.18)
   and pass it to the IBB cache buffer.
  
 * Pass a Clinical ID identifier to the IBB cache buffer.
  
 * Add the Department code as a new field associated with a CPT code.
   Department Code is not prompted for, and is defaulted to the AMIS
   Reporting Stop Code.
  
 * Place into an Integrated Billing subsystem (IBB) cache buffer debit
   charge records for initial and updated charges and credit charge
   records for charge deletions that are subsequently batched for
   transmission to COTS billing replacement system.
  
 * Based on the associated clinical indicators, the Charge Message
   SC/EI classifications will be auto-populated according to the
   following rules:
  
   If the SC/EI for at least one ICD-9 is "Yes", then the Charge
   Message SC/EI will automatically be set to "Yes".
         
   If the SC/EI for all ICD-9's are "No", then the Charge Message
   SC/EI will automatically be set to "No".
         
   If at least one ICD-9 is missing an SC/EI and none of the
   other ICD-9's SC/EI is "Yes", use the Encounter Level SC/EI.
  
 *  The post-installation routine, PX10164P, will create a new subentry (or 
    replace an existing one) for ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING in the
    PACKAGE (#3) multiple field of the Visit Tracking Parameters (#150.9)
    file.
