Subject: EOB FILE ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch was produced as a result of a determination that data missing 
 in VistA was needed to give the users the ability for EEOBs (Electronic
 Explanation of Benefits) contained on an ERA (Electronic Remittance 
 Advice) to be automatically verified.  The criteria to be used for
 verification include the statement start and end dates from the 835 flat
 file.  We already receive the data in the flat file, but do not currently
 store it.  This patch will retrieve the 2 fields from the 835 flat file
 and will store them in 2 new fields in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS file
 (#361.1) in fields STATEMENT START DATE (#1.1) and STATEMENT END DATE
 (#1.11).  These 2 fields will then be included when EEOB data is displayed
 in TPJI (Third Party Joint Inquiry).
  
 In addition, the TRACE NUMBER field (#.07) in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS 
 file (#361.1) was originally defined as having a maximum length of 20 
 characters.  Payers can actually send up to 30 characters in this field.  
 If the payer's trace # exceeds 20 characters, the reasons for the 
 adjustments are not stored with the EEOB detail.  This patch increases 
 the length of the TRACE NUMBER field to 30 characters.  This was reported 
 in NOIS LOU-0404-40646.
