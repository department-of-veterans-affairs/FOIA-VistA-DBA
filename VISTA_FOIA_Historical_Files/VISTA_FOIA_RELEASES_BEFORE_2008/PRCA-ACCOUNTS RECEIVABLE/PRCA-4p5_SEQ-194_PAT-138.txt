Description:
============

 VHA has historically had a problem estimating its true accounts 
 receivable because most receivables are overstated when they are 
 established. Due to this problem of overstatement, Congress and other
 oversight authorities have extreme difficulty trying to assess the amount
 that is actually owed to the VHA.
  
 To assist with accurate reporting of receivable amounts, changes have
 been made to capture adjustments returned by Medicare payer.  These 
 amounts are determined through the MRA (Medicare Remittance 
 Advice) project and passed to the Accounts Receivable application.
  
 These adjustments account for 
 1.  the portions of the claim that extend beyond the amount of the bill 
 that is approved for reimbursement by Medicare ( Contractual Adjustments)
 2.   the actual amount that Medicare would have paid on the claim, if
 Medicare reimbursed VHA (Unreimbursable Medicare expense)
  
 Only secondary claim amounts will be reported to the AR module.  No MRA 
 request claims will be reported.
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 IB passes two data elements to AR to be captured; the Medicare 
 Contractual Adjustment and the Unreimbursable Medicare Expense.  The 
 value of the ORIGINAL AMOUNT field (#3) in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file 
 (#430) becomes the original total of the bill and is sent to MEDICARE 
 minus the values of these two new data elements.  These two new fields 
 are sent from IB to AR at the time when the secondary claim (from MRA 
 Request) is authorized.  They are displayed on the Profile of Accounts 
 Receivable and the Full Account Profile.
  
 As a result of the change to the ORIGINAL AMOUNT (#3) field in the
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430), the auto-verify logic within the EDI 
 Lockbox Worklist had to be changed to check the payer's reported amount of
 the claim against the total of the ORIGINAL AMOUNT field (#3) plus the
 values in the 2 new fields instead of just checking the ORIGINAL AMOUNT 
 field alone.
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 IB passes two variables, as part of the PRCASV array, to REL^PRCASVC so 
 that AR can capture them; the Medicare Contractual Adjustment and the
 Unreimbursable Medicare Expense.
  
 The routines PRCADR1 and PRCAATR have been modified to print Medicare 
 Contractual Adjustment and Unreimbursed Medicare Expense.
  
 The routine PRCASVC has been modified to allow for capture and storing of 
 the two New data elements that are passed from IB.
  
 The routine RCDPEV has been modified to use the new logic for 
 calculating the VistA original bill amount to match to the original billed
 amount from the payer (on the ERA) for auto-verification of EEOB data 
 within the ERA Worklist.
