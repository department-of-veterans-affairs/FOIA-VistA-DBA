 ;;Narrative:  An examination of hearing impairment must be conducted by a
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",10,0)
 ;;state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",11,0)
 ;;discrimination test (specifically, the Maryland CNC recording) and a
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",12,0)
 ;;pure tone audiometry test in a sound isolated booth that meets American
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",13,0)
 ;;National Standards Institute standards (ANSI S3.1.1991) for ambient noise.
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",14,0)
 ;;Measurements will be reported at the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000,
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",15,0)
 ;;and 4000 Hz.  The examination will include the following tests: Pure tone
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",16,0)
 ;;audiometry by air conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",17,0)
 ;;8000 Hz, and by bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",18,0)
 ;;4000 Hz, spondee thresholds, speech recognition using the recorded
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",19,0)
 ;;Maryland CNC Test, tympanometry and acoustic reflex tests, and, when
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",20,0)
 ;;necessary, Stenger tests.  Bone conduction thresholds are measured 
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",21,0)
 ;;when the air conduction thresholds are poorer than 15 dB HL.  A modified
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",22,0)
 ;;Hughson-Westlake procedure will be used with appropriate masking.  A
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",23,0)
 ;;Stenger must be administered whenever pure tone air conduction
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",24,0)
 ;;thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz differ by 20 dB or more
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",25,0)
 ;;between the two ears.  Maximum speech recognition will be reported with
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",26,0)
 ;;the 50 word VA approved recording of the Maryland CNC test.  When speech
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",27,0)
 ;;recognition is 92% or less, a performance intensity function will be
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",28,0)
 ;;obtained with a starting presentation level of 40dB re SRT.  If necessary,
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",29,0)
 ;;the starting level will be adjusted upward to obtain a level at least 5 dB
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",30,0)
 ;;above the threshold at 2000 Hz.  The examination will be conducted without
"RTN","DVBCWAU5",31,0)
 ;;the use of hearing aids.  Both ears must be examined for hearing

"RTN","DVBCWME7",121,0)
 ;;           purposes, means that the veteran, because of injury or disease,
"RTN","DVBCWME7",122,0)
 ;;           is not capable of managing benefit payments in his or her best
"RTN","DVBCWME7",123,0)
 ;;           interest. In order to assist raters in making a legal determination
"RTN","DVBCWME7",124,0)
 ;;           as to competency, please address the following:
"RTN","DVBCWME7",125,0)
 ;;             - What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability
"RTN","DVBCWME7",126,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",127,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",128,0)
 ;;               payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
"RTN","DVBCWME7",129,0)
 ;;               and handling the payment prudently? Does the veteran handle
"RTN","DVBCWME7",130,0)
 ;;               the money and pay the bills?
"RTN","DVBCWME7",131,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWME7",132,0)
 ;;             - Based on your examination, do you believe that the veteran is
"RTN","DVBCWME7",133,0)
 ;;               capable of managing his or her financial affairs?
"RTN","DVBCWME7",134,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",135,0)

 ;;               If you believe a Social Work Service assessment is needed before
"RTN","DVBCWME7",137,0)
 ;;               you can give your opinion on the veteran's ability to manage his
"RTN","DVBCWME7",138,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",139,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",142,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",144,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",145,0)
 ;;              or testing, please indicate why. If the requested opinion cannot
"RTN","DVBCWME7",146,0)
 ;;              be expressed without resorting to speculation or making improbable
"RTN","DVBCWME7",147,0)
 ;;              assumptions say so, and explain why. If the opinion asks "...is it
"RTN","DVBCWME7",148,0)
 ;;              at least as likely as not..?", fully explain the clinical findings
"RTN","DVBCWME7",149,0)

"RTN","DVBCWME7",150,0)
 ;;
