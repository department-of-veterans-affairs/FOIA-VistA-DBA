Description: 
============

 A new sub-menu "Manage orderable items [ORCM ORDERABLES MENU]" will be 
 added to the Order Menu Management [ORCM MGMT] option menu with this 
 patch, replacing the single "Enter/edit orderable items [ORCM 
 ORDERABLES]" option which will now be moved to this new menu instead.  
 Two other new options will be created in this menu as well, as described 
 below.
  
 PROBLEMS and Related NOIS:
 ==========================
 1. MAR-1201-20370   INPT MED ORDERS DISPLAY IN THE WRONG GROUP
    E3R #17634       SELECTIVE RESTRICTION OF PHARM ORDERABLES TO Q.O.S
 This patch adds the ability to mark certain medication or laboratory
 orderable items for use in quick orders only; these items would then be
 screened out of the listbox presented in the standard order dialog.  This
 may be done by type, so for example an item that is orderable as both an
 IV Fluid Additive and IV Medication may only be restricted to QO-use as an
 IV Additive and not as a medication.  A new option will be available on
 the "Manage orderable items [ORCM ORDERABLES MENU]" option menu to allow
 items to be selected by type, then marked for QO-use only; This
 designation may also be undone via the same option.  A post-init will loop
 through the Order Dialog file #101.41 and update the screen logic for all
 orderable item prompts to look for this new flag.
  
 2. E3R #14113       SEARCH & REPLACE TOOL FOR ORDERABLE ITEM.
 This patch adds a utility to search, and replace if desired, orderable 
 items within quick orders and order dialogs.  An item may be entered to
 search for, and all quick orders or dialogs that contain the item will be
 displayed; if desired, a new item may be entered and any or all of the
 listed quick orders or dialogs may be selected to have the item replaced
 with the new one.
