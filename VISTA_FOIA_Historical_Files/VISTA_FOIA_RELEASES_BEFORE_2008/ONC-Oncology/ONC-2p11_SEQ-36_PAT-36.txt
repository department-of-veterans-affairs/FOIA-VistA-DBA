 This patch will implement the FACILITY ONCOLOGY REGISTRY DATA STANDARDS 
 (FORDS).
 
 In addition implementing FORDS, this patch also contains the following items:
 
 A) PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER
    CANCER #1
    CANCER #2
    CANCER #3
    CANCER #4
 
    The following changes have been made to the PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER
    dialog:
 
    a) If a CANCER #1-3 value was deleted, the subsequent cancers were also
       automatically deleted.  e.g.  If CANCER #3 was deleted, CANCER #4 was
       also deleted.  This feature has been removed.
 
    b) The value NOT APPLICABLE has been added as a choice for CANCER #1-4.
  
    c) If there is no default value available for CANCER #1-4, the default
       value will be NOT APPLICABLE.
 
 B) DATE CASE COMPLETED (165.5,90)
    REPORTING DATE      (165.5,94)
 
    At the National Coordinator of VA Cancer Programs request the following
    changes have been made:
 
    1) ABSTRACT DATE has been renamed DATE CASE COMPLETED and moved in the
       abstract dialog.  It now appears after ABSTRACT STATUS (165.5,91).  
    2) REPORTING DATE has been removed.
 
 C) [TD Print Suspense List by Month/Terminal Digit (132c)]
 
    The "Print Suspense List by Month/Terminal Digit" option has been 
    modified to include a patient count and SUSPENSE MONTH subcount.
 
 D) SCREENING OUT NON-ANALYTIC CASES
    [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
      [CC Create State Data Disk]
      [SR Create a report to preview State output]
 
    An additional prompt has been added to the NAACCR State Record Layout
    dialog which will allow the registrar to include or exclude non-analytic
    cases from the extract.
 
    e.g.
 
    Select *..Utility Options Option: CC  Create State Data Disk
     DISPLAY/PRINT on-line instructions? No//   NO
 
     Available record layouts:
 
     1) VAACCR Record Layout Version 9.1 (VA Registry)
     2) NAACCR State Record Layout Version 9.1
 
     Select record layout: 2  NAACCR State Record Layout Version 9.1
 
     Hospital ACoS Number: 211145// 
     Select start date: 1/1/2002  (JAN 01, 2002)
     Select end date: 12/31/2002  (DEC 31, 2002)
     Analytic cases only? YES// YES
 
     These are your current settings:
 
     Record layout.......: STATE EXTRACT V9.1
     Hospital ACoS Number: 211145
     Start date..........: 1/1/02
     End date............: 12/31/02
     Analytic cases only.: YES
 
     Answering "YES" will screen out non-analytic cases (CLASS OF CASE 3-9)
     from the extract.
 
     VAACCR extracts will automatically have non-analytic cases screened 
     out.
 
 E) HEPATITIS C (165.5,1010)
 
    HEPATITIS C has been added to the "Cancer Identification" portion of the
    abstract.  The HEPATITIS C prompt will only appear for LIVER cases.
 
 F) CLARIFICATIONS TO THE AJCC CANCER STAGING MANUAL, 6TH EDITION
 
    AJCC has published a list of changes to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual,
    6th Edition.  After reviewing this list it was determined that
    the following changes were necessary to the VISTA ONCOLOGY package.
 
    a) C10.3 POSTERIOR WALL OF OROPHARYNX can now be staged.
       It was previously being stuffed with T88 N88 M88.
 
    b) C14.0 PHARYNX, NOS
       C14.2 WALDEYER'S RING
       C14.8 OVERLAPPING LESION OF LIP, ORAL CAVITY AND PHARYNX

       C70.9 MENINGES, NOS
         will now be stuffed with T88 N88 M88 and STAGE GROUP 88 (NA).
 
    c) The SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA staging table has been modified.
     
       New table:
