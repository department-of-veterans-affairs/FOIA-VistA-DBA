Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*281 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA  
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*281 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*281 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none. 
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes 
 made,no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation of 
 this patch.
 ***********************************************************************
 Due to extensive historical data transmission requirements and mandated 
 setups required for such, a phased installation and implementation of this 
 patch will be utilized for release of this patch.  The software download 
 information will be made available to sites attending one of the following 
 national audioconference training calls:
 
 Tuesday, June 8 at 1:00 - 3:00 PM EST for VISNs 1-2-3-4-5-6 
 Thursday, June 10 at 3:00 - 5:00 PM EST for VISNs 7-8-9-10-11 
 Tuesday, June 15 at 4:00 - 6:00 PM EST for VISNs 12-15-16-17-23 
 Wednesday, June 16 at 2:00 - 4:00 PM EST for VISNs 18-19-20-21-22 
 Thursday, June 17 at 2:00 - 4:00 PM EST for those unable to attend the 
 other calls. 
 
 The VANTS telephone number is 1 800 767-1750 and the access code for all 
 calls is 13143.
 
 This patch will involve reseeding of the EPI databases for each site to 
 allow the new data created by this patch to be captured.  It is imperative 
 each site attend an audioconference prior to installation and 
 implementation of LR*5.2*281.
 
 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SEEDING THE HISTORICAL DATA:
  
 Historical data must be gathered from October 1, 2000 through June 14, 
 2004.  Use the Lab EPI Manual Run (Enhanced) [LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN] 
 option to run/gather and transmit 6 manual runs (consecutive runs) at 
 a time.
  
 ** Sites DO NOT transmit on June 16 or July 4 to avoid Austin Automation 
 Center (AAC) capacity limitations. **
  
 Batch #1: October 1, 2000 -March 31, 2001
 Batch #2: April 1, 2001 - September 30, 2001
 Batch #3: October 1, 2001 - March 31, 2002
 Batch #4: April 1, 2002 - September 30, 2002
 Batch #5: October 1, 2002 - March 31, 2003
 Batch #6: April 1, 2003 - September 30, 2003
 Batch #7: October 1, 2003 - March 31, 2004
 Batch #8: April 1, 2004 - June 14, 2004 
  
 Sites will run 8 batches of reports. Each batch should contain 6 separate 
 monthly extracts which are tasked separately by month, i.e., OCT 2000, NOV 
 2000, DEC 2000, JAN 2001, FEB 2001, MAR 2001 = 1 batch and will generate 
 six separate processing reports back to the station and transmit them over 
 a five week period June 10, 2004 - July 12, 2004.
 You do not have to wait for one monthly extract to run before starting the 
 next in a batch.
 You do not have to wait for one batch to complete running before queuing 
 the next batch.
 If you receive any fatal errors and the monthly extract is rejected, you 
 will need to fix the error and retransmit that month.
  
  
 Sites may transmit reports to AAC on evenings and weekends following this 
 schedule:
 1. VISNs with odd numbers are asked to transmit batches on Tuesday & 
 Thursday during the PM hours and Saturdays.
 2. VISNs with even numbers are asked to transmit on Monday & Friday during 
 the PM hours and Sundays.
  
 **  NO Sites may transmit on June 16 or July 4 due to AAC limitations. **
 
 The EPI Enhancement patch, LR*5.2*281, contains enhancements and 
 modifications to the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) software.
 The enhancements and modifications included in this patch are:
 
 1) New EPI Summary Verification Report of EPI Extracted Data from Site:
    The new Verification Summary Report of EPI Extracted Data from Site   
    replaces the existing Emerging Pathogens Verification Report.  This 
    new summary report consists of the following functionality:
         1) Summary report automatically generated at the sites and sent    
            to the EPI-REPORT mail group on the 15th day of each month
         2) Summary pages are displayed in a human readable format used 
            for quick viewing
         3) Displays reporting site name and station number
         4) Summary report is only 1-2 pages long
         5) Summary report displays emerging pathogens total number of
            occurrences during the monthly processing cycle
         6) Summary report displays emerging pathogens total number of
            persons with occurrences during the monthly processing cycle
         7) Displays Resolution of Risk Assessment number of persons 
            with the nationally rolled-up resolution Hepatitis C that 
            occurred during monthly processing cycle
 
 2) New Detailed Verification Report is a detailed pathogen-specific report 
 for validation purposes.  The Print Detailed Verification Report [LREPI 
 VERIFICATION REPORT] option prints this report.  This report is 
 automatically generated when your site does an automated or manual run and 
 data is sent to Austin Automation Center.  Six months of previous reports 
 are kept as well as the current month for printing.
 
 3) Sites now have the ability to capture and manipulate EPI data into a 
 report or spreadsheet-delimited format.  A site can also add pathogens for 
 local use and generate reports or capture data in a spreadsheet format for 
 local use.
 
 4) Additional data will be sent to Austin.  Including:
         LOINC codes
         Master Patient Index
         County and State for patient demographics
         MIC values
         The new Race and Ethnicity fields
 
 5) Provide the ability to capture 6 new pathogens:
         All Staphylococcus aureus (Reference #18)
         Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
         (Reference #19)
         Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA)
          (Reference #20)
         Vancomycin-Resistant Coagulase Negative Staphylococci/Staph epi   
         (VRSE)(Reference #21)
         All Streptococcus pneumoniae (Reference #22)
         All Enterococci (Reference #23)
 
 6) EPI is also enhanced to capture the approved newer Legionella Urinary 
 Antigen test.
 
 7) A bug is fixed with the date handling for start and stop date.
 
 8) The new field PREVIOUS CYCLE (#19) in the Lab Search/Extract file(#69.5) 
 contains a numeric entry which defines the number of previous cycles to 
 search.  These findings will be reported in a separate message.  This field 
 is set to 1 for TUBERCULOSIS.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for
       them.
  
   2.  Use the 'Load a Distribution' option to load the Host file on your
       system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport   
       global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify 
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the   
       following options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a 
       Transport Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the  
       routines in your production account to the routines in the patch  
       by using the 'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' 
       option.
  
   7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*281'.
  
       If prompted ' Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? YES//' choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?  
       YES// ' choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
   8.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
   9.  Routine LR281 will be deleted after successful patch installation.
