Subject: LASER LABEL CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. A site reported a problem with printing labels with long SIGs. If 
 there were no spaces in the SIG, the label print would get into an 
 infinite loop. This patch corrects this problem by making the SIG print 
 break on spaces and commas. If there are no spaces and no commas, the SIG 
 print will break on a character basis. 
 NOIS: SAM-0703-21864, SAM-0703-21873, IND-0703-41198, FAV-0603-70287, 
 MUS-0603-70207, SBY-0503-32205, CTX-0803-71468
  
 2. A site reported a problem when printing multiple copies of labels that 
 contained SIG instructions that ran over one label. On the 2-n copies, 
 not all of the SIG printed correctly. This patch corrects this problem by 
 appropriately printing all of the SIG information on all copies.
 NOIS: MON-0703-50217, MAD-0603-41794, SPO-0603-50792, MAC-0803-60872
  
 3. A site reported a problem that long mailing addresses were being 
 truncated on the mailing label. This patch corrects this problem by 
 adjusting the font size lower until the entire address will print. 
 NOIS: NIN-0803-40514
  
 4. A site reported a problem with a long drug name overflowing onto the 
 warning label section. This patch corrects this problem by adjusting the 
 font size down until the drug name fits on the bottle label. In addition, 
 a utility is included to build the information into the TERMINAL TYPE 
 file (#3.2) for bolding the drug name at different fonts. Once the patch
 is installed, run the routine PSOLLU3 in programmer mode. Once you have
 updated all current laser label devices, the routine may be deleted.
 NOIS: TOM-0503-41452 
  
 5. A site reported a problem with receiving an error if there was a TAB 
 character in the SIG text. This patch corrects this problem by handling 
 the entry of non-visible characters. NOIS: BRX-0703-12341, 
 WPB-0703-32079, SBY-0703-30153
  
 6. A site reported a problem with the printing of the Method of Pickup 
 information. It was being truncated if it was over about 20 characters. 
 This patch corrects this problem by adjusting the font and allowing this 
 information to print on multiple lines. NOIS: ANN-0503-42213 
  
 7. A problem was discovered with printing the narrative information on 
 the label. Under certain conditions, the text would not wrap correctly. 
 This patch corrects this problem by wrapping on the character size if the 
 text between spaces is too long for the allocated area on the label.
  
 8. A site reported a problem with adjusting the left margin of the laser 
 label print. The 'Qty' header wouldn't properly adjust. This patch 
 corrects this problem by adding the ability to move the line that prints 
 quantity information. NOIS: IRO-0503-40327
  
 9. A site reported a problem of no physician name or an incorrect name 
 printing on the bottle label. This happened if the SIG was too long to 
 fit on the bottle label, but was not too long to fit on the filling 
 document. This patch corrects the problem. NOIS: SHR-0703-72297, 
 CLL-0803-41010

 take less than 1 minute.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.

     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*141):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*141.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
   
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  9. Once the patch is installed, run the routine PSOLLU3 in programmer
     mode. Once you have updated all current laser label devices, the
     routine may be deleted.
