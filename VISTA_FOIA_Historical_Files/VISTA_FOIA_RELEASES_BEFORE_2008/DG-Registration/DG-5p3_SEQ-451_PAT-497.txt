   OVERVIEW
   ========
  
   The purpose of the Geographic Means Testing Phase II project is to define
   the functionality required to implement automation to support the concept
   of a new category of veterans being termed User Enrollees.
  
   Veterans who do not utilize the VA health care system will not be required
   to submit financial information on an annual basis.  Assessment of
   financial status is only considered necessary for veterans who are
   actually utilizing their health care benefits, that is - receiving care
   through VA.  VHA will establish the concept of the "User Enrollee" to be
   utilized for enrollment communication purposes.
  
   This project addresses the identification of the User Enrollee and
   subsequent changes to reflect the business process of only sending MT
   renewals and GMT conversion communications to those veterans identified as
   User Enrollees.
  
   The Geographic Means Testing Phase II project will flag veterans who are
   actively using the system through appointments, Fee Basis authorizations,
   or Encounters as User Enrollees.  The user enrollee information will be
   shared with the Health Eligibility Center, who will share the same
   information with all sites of record.  Means Test renewal letters and GMT
   conversion letters will only be sent to veterans who are designated as user
   enrollees by the site that so designated the veteran.
  
   A one-time seeding of the user enrollee data by each site will be done.
   A Z07 HL7 message will be sent to the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) for
   each veteran designated as a User Enrollee.  After the HEC receives the one-
   time seeding from all VISTA sites, the user enrollee data will be 
   synchronized with all sites of record by triggering a Z11 HL7 message for
   each veteran.
  
   The software for this patch, DG*5.3*497, and associated patches,  are
   being distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file 
   DG_53_P497.KID). This patch contains the informational portion of
   DG*5.3*497 and provides field personnel with instructions on how to
   acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
  
   The enhancements are being distributed in several patches that will be
   installed in three phases as outlined below:
  
   NOTE: The 1st install has been completed.

   FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
   ======================
   Modifications to the Z07/Z11 HL7 message background process will be made

   will not be visible to users.
  
  
  
   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
   =====================
   1. Modifications to the Z11 HL7 receiver process to support the new User
      Enrollees fields.
  
   2. Modifications to the Z07 HL7 message builder process to include the new
      fields added for User Enrollees data.

   *                                                                         *
   * It is recommended this patch be installed outside of normal business    *
   * hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.    *
   * This patch contains a post install routine for initial seeding of User  *
   * Enrollee data which will go through each patient and determine their    *
   * User Enrollee status by checking inpatient/outpatient encounters,       *
   * scheduled appointments and Fee basis authorizations. The post install   *
   * process will queue itself. The process run time will vary from site to  * 
   * site  dependent upon the number of records that exist in the patient    *
   * file, the number of Veterans determined as User Enrollees and system    *
   * performance. The times below will give you an estimation of how long    *
   * the post install process will take.                                     *
   *                                                                         *

   The following post install routine run times are taken from a few test
   sites used for determining approximate number of User Enrollees per
   site.

   This patch should NOT be installed while the IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM
   BACKGROUND JOB] is running.
  
  
  
   In order to prevent missing HL7 traffic, TaskMan should be placed in a wait
   state while the installation process runs. The post install routine will
   be invoked at the end of the installation process and queue itself via
   Taskman. At that time Taskman should be returned to its normal state.

      Installation Steps:
     ==================
  
     1. Download the KIDS file DG_53_P497.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
        directory of either Albany, Hines, or the Salt Lake CIOFO to the
        appropriate directory on your system.
  
     2. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS INSTALLATION
        menu, and enter:  DG_53_P497.KID
  
     3. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
        ROUTINE SUMMARY section of patches EAS*1*25, DG*5.3*497, IVM*2*75,
        or FB*3.5*54 are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set
        at this time.
  
     4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
     5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
        prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*497).
  
        a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
  
        d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
     6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select DG*5.3*497.
  
     7. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is
        recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
        rebuilt the next time the system does this task.
  
     8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT Logon's during the install?
        YES//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
     9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
        options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
            IVM BACKGROUND JOB
  
    10. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 3, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
  
    11. Return TaskMan to it's normal state.
  
    12. If you unscheduled the IVM Background Job, please reschedule it.
  
   Post Install routine process:
   =============================
  
   This host file contains a post install routine for the initial seeding
   of User Enrollee data to HEC via Z07 HL7 messages. The post install 
   routine will queue itself in Taskman. It will send a mailman message to
   the installer after the process has completed successfully. It can be
   stopped via taskman while it is running.
  
   To stop the process:
   ====================
  
   Select OPTION NAME: TASKMAN USER  XUTM USER     TaskMan User
   TaskMan User
  
   Select TASK: 684309  USER ENROLLEE INITIAL DETERMINATION PROCESS
  
                 Taskman User Option
  
                      Display status.
                      Stop task.
                      Edit task.
                      Print task.
                      List own tasks.
                      Select another task.
  
                 Select Action (Task # 684305): ST  Stop task.
  
   Following mailman message is generated and sent to the user when 
   the process is requested to stop.
