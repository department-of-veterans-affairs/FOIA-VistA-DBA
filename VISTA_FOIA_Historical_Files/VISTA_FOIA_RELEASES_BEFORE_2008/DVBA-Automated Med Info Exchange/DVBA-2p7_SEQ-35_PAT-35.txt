Description: 
============

 I. DESCRIPTION
  
 This patch introduces changes to the VistA Automated Medical Information
 Exchange (AMIE) module.  The patch exports the (M)UMPs server side of the
 Compensation & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) which is a Graphic User
 Interface (GUI) for the VistA Automated Medical Information Exchange 
 (AMIE II) menu options.
  
 The purpose of this patch description is to provide an overview of
 the functionality that will be delivered in this patch and to provide
 field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and implement
 the patch software.
  
 II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 Compensation & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) is a Graphic User
 Interface (GUI) for VistA Automated Medical Information exchange (AMIE II)
 menu options.  The CAPRI Project is a One VA cooperative effort with
 objectives of creating, testing, and nationally implementing a graphical
 user interface to enhance the retrieval and dissemination of data from
 VistA AMIE II menu options. This patch will install the VistA server
 portion in order to facilitate the sharing of clinically valuable C&P
 examination results with multiple users of the Text Integrated Utility
 file.
  
 CAPRI is an adjunct to VistA's AMIE-II.  It duplicates all Regional Office
 AMIE-II functionality in a GUI format.  This patch introduces software
 that supports VistA patient data access by the CAPRI GUI client software
 and provides no new or enhanced functionality to the VistA system.
  
  
 For more information regarding Compensation & Pension Record Interchange
 (CAPRI), please refer to the AMIE-II website at

 V.  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
 The VISTA server portion of the CAPRI application is distributed in a
 PackMan message through the National Patch Module.  The KIDS build is
 DVBA*2.7*35.
  
 * AMIE Users can be on the system and working during this installation.
  
 * The installation of the server software takes less than 5 minutes.
  
  
 1. Send the PackMan patch message to the account in which you wish to
    install the build.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option from the
    PackMan menu.  This will load the PackMan KIDS build.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu, select
    the installation menu.
  
 3. You may now elect to use the following options (when prompted for
    INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*35).
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT backup
       any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
       installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
       templates, etc.).
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*35.
  
 5. The install will ask if you wish to rebuild menu trees.  It is
    recommended that you answer NO to this prompt.  The trees will be
    rebuilt next time the system performs this task.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs' during the install?
    YES//', it is recommended that you answer NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols?  YES//', answer NO.
  
 8. At the 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install Messages'
    prompt, you can direct output to your desired device.
  
 VI. POST-INSTALLATION ACTIVITIES
  
 USER ACCESS TO CAPRI
 CAPRI users without the @ sign and programmer access will have to be
 assigned an option context to use an option.  The security aspect of CAPRI
 is that it looks for option context DVBA CAPRI GUI in the user's menu
 structure (part of a primary menu or on a secondary menu).  So if the
 option is not assigned in some fashion, the user will get a message that
 they do not have access to CAPRI.
  
 There are two ways to grant a user access to CAPRI.
  
    * You can add CAPRI GUI Broker [DVBA CAPRI GUI] as an ITEM in the
      OPTION file on a user's assigned primary menu.
  
    * You can place CAPRI GUI Broker [DVBA CAPRI GUI] on a user's
      individual secondary menu.
