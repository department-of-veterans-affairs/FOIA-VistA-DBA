Description: 
============

  
   ** You need to install Kernel Patch XU*8*50 before installing this patch **
  =============================================================================
   -This patch now allows you to transport a Global Package correctly. This bug
    was introduced with patch 44.
   -The input transform for the Name field in the Build file has been changed
    to allow sites to create local patches. It now allows 6 digit patch numbers
     i.e.  XU*8.0*662001
   -Kernel 8 patches will now contain the sequence number in the Patch
    Application History multiple of the Package file.
   -HL LOGICAL LINK entries were not being cross-referenced.
   -The post-install routine XQP50 will update the Patch Application History
    multiple with the information about patch 50. The DATE APPLIED and APPLIED
    BY fields will be the same as this patch. 
  
  =============================================================================
                      **** INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ****
  =============================================================================
  
   This patch can be installed with users on the system, but no other users
   should be using KIDS while you install this patch.
   Since this patch is an update to KIDS, no other patches should be installed
   during the installation of this patch.
  =============================================================================
    
  INSTALLATION:
    1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the Transport
        global.
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3  Print Transport Global
           4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5  Backup a Transport Global
           6  Install Package(s)
    5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
