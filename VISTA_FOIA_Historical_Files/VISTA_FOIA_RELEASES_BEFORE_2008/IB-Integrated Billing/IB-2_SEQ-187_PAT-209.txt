Subject: OUTPUT TRANSFORM FIX IN BILL/CLAIMS FILE

Category:

  file directly through FileMan.

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
  1.  AUG-1102-31748     ERROR TRYING TO PRINT FILEMAN REPORT 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the FileMan Print, Search and Sort functions on the
    BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file, there are 4 fields which will cause the
    process to halt with a MUMPS "Undefined" error.  The problem is
    with the Output Transform code which tries to use the variable
    DA and expects it to represent the IEN of the current Bill/Claims
    record.  In the FileMan functions mentioned above, the IEN is
    stored in the variable D0 (D-zero) not in DA. 
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects the issue by modifying the four output transforms
    to use D0 if DA is not available.
   
  TECHNICAL:
  ==========
  1.  The Output Transforms for four fields in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file
      have been altered as follows:
   
      112  --  PRIMARY INSURANCE POLICY
      113  --  SECONDARY INSURANCE POLICY
      114  --  TERTIARY INSURANCE POLICY
      136  --  BILL PAYER POLICY
   
      from:  S Y=$$TRANS^IBCNS2(DA,Y)
        to:  S Y=$$TRANS^IBCNS2($G(DA,D0),Y)
