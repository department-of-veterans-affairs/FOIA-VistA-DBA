Subject: ADD PMIS SECTION DELETE FIELD

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 project to add Patient 
 Medication Information (PMI) print to labels, the ability to delete 
 certain PMI sections from label output is required. In order to 
 accomplish this a new field, PMIS SECTION DELETE (#15), has been added to
 the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). This will allow the Pharmacy Benefits
 Manager to mark certain PMI sections to delete them from printing on
 labels. This patch adds this new field and populates it appropriately.
