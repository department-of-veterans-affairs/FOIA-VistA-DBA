Subject: FIX FOR INACTIVATED STOP CODE 101

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch SD*5.3*500, which was nationally released on March 8, 2007, 
 inactivated stop code 101 (Emergency Unit) and activated stop code 130 
 with the new name "Emergency Dept" in the Clinic Stop (#40.7) file.
 The effective date for each was March 1, 2007. This caused multiple 
 encounters, with dates of March 1, 2007 through the date of patch 
 installation, to fail the validation check during the nightly Ambulatory
 Care transmission process for error code A020. The validation logic 
 includes a check for the stop code activate/inactivate effective date.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD182394 - SD*5.3*500 inactivated 101
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Patch SD*5.3*500, which was nationally released on March 8, 2007, 
    inactivated stop code 101 (Emergency Unit) and activated stop code 130 
    with the new name "Emergency Dept" in the Clinic Stop (#40.7) file.
    The effective date for each was March 1, 2007. This caused multiple 
    encounters, with dates of March 1, 2007 through the date of patch 
    installation, to fail the validation check during the nightly
    Ambulatory Care transmission process for error code A020.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch contains post-init routine SD53P511, which will read
    through the Outpatient Encounter (#409.68) file, for all encounters
    created on or after March 1, 2007, and any encounters that contain
    the pointer (Internal Entry Number - IEN) for Stop Code 101, will be
    updated with the IEN for Stop Code 130.
  
    Additionally, routine SD53P511 will generate a Mailman message to the
    user who installs this patch, containing a list of all encounters that
    were updated. The message will be From: EMERGENCY PATCH SD*5.3*511
    with the Subject: STOP CODE UPDATE FROM 101 TO 130.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
