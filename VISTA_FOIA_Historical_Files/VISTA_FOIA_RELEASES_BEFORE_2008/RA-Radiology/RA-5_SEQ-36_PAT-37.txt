Description: 
============

 This patch provides new options for generating Performance Indicator 
 reports.
  
 There are two types of reports, Summary and Detail. 
  
 The Summary report displays counts of hours elapsed from EXAM DATE to DATE
 REPORT ENTERED and from EXAM DATE to VERIFIED DATE.  The counts are 
 placed under columns of 24 hour increments, from ">0-24", ">24-48", etc.
 to ">240".  The last column is "Pending", which is used for cases that
 have no data entered for DATE REPORT ENTERED and/or VERIFIED DATE.
  
 The Detail report lists data from individual cases:  Patient Name, Case #,
 Date/Time Registered, Date/Time Transcribed, Hrs, Date/Time Verified, Hrs,
 Radiologist, Category of Exam, Report Status, and Imaging Type.
  
  
 Routines Added
 --------------
  
     Routines RAPM, RAPM1, RAPM2, and RAPM3 are new.  They are used by 
 the new Performance Indicator options.
  
 Field Added
 ----------- 
 The following multiple field has been added to File #79, RAD/NUC MED
 DIVISION:
  
         175  PERFORM INDICATOR MAIL ADDRESS subfile 79.0175 [1;0]
              .01  PERFORM INDICATOR MAIL ADDRESS  [0;1]
  
  
 Options Added
 -------------
  
 A new menu option has been placed under the 'Management Reports Menu':
  
        Performance Indicator ... [RA PERFORMIN MENU]
           Enter/Edit OUTLOOK mail group [RA PERFORMIN MAIL GROUP ENTRY]
           Summary/Detail report [RA PERFORMIN RPTS]
  
 The 'Enter/Edit OUTLOOK mail group' option allows the site to enter one or
 more OUTLOOK mail groups that are to receive the output of the Summary 
 report.  If no OUTLOOK mail group is entered, then the user will not be 
 asked if the Summary report should be sent to OUTLOOK.
  
 The 'Summary/Detail report' option will prompt for Report Type (summary,
 detail, or both), Starting and Ending dates, Division, and Imaging Type.
  
 If the Report Type is "summary" or "both", then the user will be asked if
 the summary output should also be sent to the new local mail group, "G.RAD
 PERFORMANCE INDICATOR", and to any OUTLOOK mail group(s) defined with the 
 new 'Enter/Edit OUTLOOK mail group' option.
  
 If the Report Type is "detail" or "both", then the user will be asked
 which item should be used to sort the listing:  Case Number, Category of
 Exam, Imaging Type, Patient Name, Radiologist (Primary Interpreting
 Staff), Hrs. to Transcrip., or Hrs to Verif.
  
 The Date Range is 91 days maximum for the Summary report and 31 days 
 maximum for the Detail report.  In addition, the Ending Date for the 
 Summary Report must be at least 10 days before the day that the option was
 run (today.)
  
 Mail Group Added
 ----------------
  
    A new Radiology mail group, RAD PERFORMANCE INDICATOR, has been 
 added to the Mail Group file.  The Coordinator of this new mail group
 should enter names of local users who should receive the Summary Report.
