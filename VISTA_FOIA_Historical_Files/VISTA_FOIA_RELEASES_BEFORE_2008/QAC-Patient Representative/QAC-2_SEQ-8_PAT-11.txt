Subject: Y2K ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Danville, using a test system set for the year 2000, discovered that new
 Reports of Contact could not be entered on that system.  The problem is in
 the way the Report of Contact number is determined.  This patch changes
 how the new Report of Contact number is assigned so that it will still
 function properly after year 2000.  This problem is addressed in NOIS
 DAN-0499-40888.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message:
  
 DAN-0499-40888 
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu option (File #19) be disabled to prevent possible 
 conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VistA users will not 
 be affected.
  
                Enter New Contact               [QAC NEW]
  
  
 Install Time - less than 2 minutes
