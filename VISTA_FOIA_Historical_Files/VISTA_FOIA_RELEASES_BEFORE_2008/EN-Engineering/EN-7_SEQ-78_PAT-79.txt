Subject: DATA CLEANSING REPORTS FOR 6929 FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch exports a series of reports that will be used to prepare the
 data in the AEMS/MERS ENG EMPLOYEE (#6929) file for conversion to the
 CoreFLS system.
    
 This patch adds a new menu option, Engineering Employee - 6929 [ENH
 ENGINEERING EMPLOYEE], to the CoreFLS AEMS/MERS Data Cleansing Reports
 [ENH DATA CLEANSING] menu. This menu option requires the security key ENH
 DATA CLEANSING and contains the following options:
     Summary Report [ENH 6929 SUMMARY REPORT]
     Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6929 REQUIRED RPT]
     Lookup Fields w/ Invalid Data Report [ENH 6929 LOOKUP RPT]
     Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report [ENH 6929 NON-REQUIRED RPT]
    
  The reports examine the following four fields: 
     NAME (#.01)
     SHOP (#.3)
     CLASSIFICATION SERIES (#10.5)
     CLASSIFICATION TITLE (#12)
  
 If any field is empty or has invalid data, it is included on one of the 
 reports.
  
 This patch includes four reports, one summary and three detailed:
  
 1.  Summary Report - lists all the fields examined and a count of how many
     times each field is either empty or contains invalid data.
  
 2.  Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each required field in the
     ENG EMPLOYEE (#6929) file that is empty. (A field is defined as
     required when the empty field causes functionality problems for
     CoreFLS.)
  
 3.  Lookup Fields with Invalid Data Report - lists each field in the ENG
     EMPLOYEE (#6929) file that contains invalid data.
  
 4.  Non-Required Fields Missing Data Report - lists each non-required
     field in the ENG EMPLOYEE (#6929) file that is empty. Because the
     fields are not required, they may be left empty, but populating these
     fields with data will improve functionality after conversion to
     CoreFLS.
