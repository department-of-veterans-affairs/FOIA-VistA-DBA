Subject: RESTORE FORWARDER & HEADERLESS PRINTOUTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description: 
============

 The following problems are corrected with this patch:
  
     XMA2 -  A previous change mistakenly dropped the code which retained
 the name of the forwarder of a message (if other than the author).  The
 dropped code is reinserted.
  
     XMA0 -  Pagination between multiple headerless prints was lost. I.e.
 if multiple messages (from a single basket) were printed without headers,
 there used to be a page break between them.  However, after the change,
 there would NOT be a page break between multiple headerless messages. The
 mechanism for denoting headerless prints was changed and this code was
 overlooked; the patch adjusts it to perform as it used to.
  
  
 INSTALLATION PROCEDURES:
  
  
 NOTE :  Save a copy of XMA0 and XMA2 either before you begin this
         installation or when requested to do so during the unloading of
         the specified PackMan message.  There are no differences in the
         installation on a VAX, ALPHA or MSM platform. This patch can be
         installed while users are on the system without damage to any
         files -- at worst, a user could get a "no source" error and have
         to re-enter the mail system (and this is highly unlikely).
  
 1. Check mapped routine set and unmap the appropriate MailMan routines.
 Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed. ***NOTE:
 If these routines are not included in your mapped routine set, please
 disregard this step.
  
 2.  Load the PackMan message into your production account.
  
 3.  Execute CHECK^XTSUMBLD to compute checksums for XMA0 and XMA2.
  
     * Stop installation, reload the original routines and call your
       supporting ISC if these values do not match those supplied below.
  
                 CHECK^XTSUMBLD Results
    Routine Name      Before Patch    After Patch    Patch List
      XMA0              9665614          9701230         15
      XMA2             10088518         10106075       5,6,10,15
  
  
 4. Remap any routines unmapped in step 1.
  
 5. It takes about 1 minute to install this patch.
