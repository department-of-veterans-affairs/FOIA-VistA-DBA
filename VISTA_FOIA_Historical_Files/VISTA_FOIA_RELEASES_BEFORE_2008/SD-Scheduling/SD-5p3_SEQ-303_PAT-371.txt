Subject: MODIFICATION TO NATIONAL ROLLUP OF ADDITIONAL ENCOUNTER PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch modifies National Rollup functionality for Additional
 Performance Measures (TIU) for national reporting. The routine SDPMHLS 
 included in patch SD*5.3*313 has been modified to now include the values 
 for encounters without progress notes and encounters that have progress 
 notes pending signatures. Additionally, this patch now ensures that the 
 totals for unique encounter providers and unique stop codes for the 
 division, now match the sum of these categories for the individual
 facilities.
  
 This patch also removes the 'DSS' reference in the mail group description
 in 'SD PM NOTIFICATION TIU' rolled out with patch SD*5.3*313. You will 
 need to know the name of the coordinator for this mail group during 
 installation, and it is suggested to verify this information prior to 
 actually installing the patch.
  
 This patch also checks the autostart flag in the HL7 SDPM Logical Link, 
 if it is not set, it will change it so that when system restarts are done,
 the logical link will automatically restart.

          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
