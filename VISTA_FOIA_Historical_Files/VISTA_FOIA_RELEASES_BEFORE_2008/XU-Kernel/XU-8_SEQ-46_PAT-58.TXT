Subject: KIDS fixes

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  
   Prerequisites: none
  =========================================================================== 
   This patch contains the following features and corrections:
   -An undefined error when installing data and the user said 'NO' to install
    the Data Dictionary.  Since the Data Dictionary is not present, the user
    gets an error.
   -Duplicate FileMan templates were not being installed, even if they were
    for two different files.
   -The question, 'Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine', will only be
    asked if the Build has an Environment Check Routine.
   -FAV-1096-72757  Restarting an Install ignores the variable XPDNOQUE, when
    the variable is set in an Environment Check Routine.
   -The Option 'Compare Transport Global to Current System' will now let you
    compare just routines or just the 2nd line of routines.
   -An Option or Protocol can now have an 'Action Type' of 'ATTACH TO MENU' or
    'DISABLE DURING INSTALL'.
   -The user will now be prompted for the Mail Group Coordinator if an Install
    is sending Mail Group(s).
   -Developers can now send Options and Protocols with the OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE
    field already set. The Options and Protocols will remain out of order after
    the install has completed.

                      **** INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ****
  =============================================================================
  
   This patch can be installed with users on the system, but no other users
   should be using KIDS while you install this patch.
   Since this patch is an update to KIDS, no other patches should be installed
   during the installation of this patch.
  =============================================================================
    
  INSTALLATION:
    1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the Transport
        global.
    4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and installed
        at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3  Print Transport Global
           4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5  Backup a Transport Global
           6  Install Package(s)
    6.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
  ===========================================================================
    
  ROUTINES:
     Checksums obtained using CHECK^XTSUMBLD
     The second line of the routine now looks like:
         ;;8.0;KERNEL;**[patch list]**;Jul 10, 1995

  DOCUMENTATION:
   1.  PARTIAL DD: BUILD #9.6
           SUB DD: ENTRIES #9.68
            FIELD: ACTION #.03
              0        SEND TO SITE

              4        ATTACH TO MENU
              5        DISABLE DURING INSTALL
  
   2. The 'Compare Transport Global to Current System' will now let you compare
      just the Routines or just the 2nd line of the Routines.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
  
  Select Installation Option: Compare Transport Global to Current System
  
  Select INSTALL NAME: TEST 2.2      Loaded from Distribution  2/26/97@13:04:56
       => TEST  ;Created on Feb 24, 1997@12:44:26
  
       Select one of the following:
  
            1         Full Comparison
            2         Second line of Routines only
            3         Routines only
  
  Type of Compare: 2  Second line of Routines only
  DEVICE: HOME// 
  
   3. When adding Options or Protocols to a Build, you now have 2 new 'Action
      Types': 4  ATTACH TO MENU and 5  DISABLE DURING INSTALL.
      ATTACH TO MENU should be used to attach an Option or Protocol that you
      are not exporting to a Menu you are exporting.
      DISABLE DURING INSTALL should be used to designate all the Options and
      Protocols that you are not exporting, but you want them put out of order
      during the install process.
  
   4. When a Mail Group is exported with KIDS, the installing user will be
      asked for the Mail Group Coordinator when they use the install option.
      The Coordinator will only be added to the Mail Group if the Mail Group
      is new or there is currently not a Coordinator.  The Mail Group Coordinator
      is optional.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
  
  Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
  Select INSTALL NAME:    TEST 2.2        Loaded from Distribution
  
  This Distribution was loaded on Feb 27, 1997@08:11:04 with header of
