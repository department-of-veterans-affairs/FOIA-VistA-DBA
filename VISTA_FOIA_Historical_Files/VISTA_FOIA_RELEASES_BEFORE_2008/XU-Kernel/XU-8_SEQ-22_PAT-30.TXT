  INSTALLATION:
    1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s)
    5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
