 Introduction to VistAWeb
 ========================
 The current version of the Remote Data Views (RDV) application is accessed 
 from within CPRS. Users are provided a display, which contains the sites 
 where the patient has previously received care. The RDV functionality allows 
 clinicians to view clinically relevant data contained within the patient's 
 record, documented at other VA or DOD facilities. Remote data is accessed 
 utilizing a visitor account with permission set within CPRS. Remote data is 
 retrieved and the data is displayed in either a textual report format (for 
 Health Summary) or in a table format (for Clinical Reports), that allows 
 the data display to be sorted by columns. 
  
 The RDV functionality is used by all VistA sites. Retrieval of remote data 
 occurs through use of a Task Mananager utility with Remote Procedure Broker 
 (RPC) calls using HL7 Messages. While the current approach for retrieving 
 remote data provides added security and control over network utilization, 
 response time may be slow for patients with large records and for patients 
 with records at multiple sites. RDV's usage is discouraged by slow response 
 times, especially  for large records or retrieval of  multiple records 
 documented at multiple sites. RDV does, however, limit the number of queries 
 at the remote sites and monitors the visitor requests for remote data 
 ensuring sensitive patient data is protected.
  
 VistAWeb explores an alternative to RDV. VistAWeb, much like RDV, requires 
 users to access their local VistA system utilizing a system account, which 
 must be assigned the secondary menu option (OR CPRS GUI CHART) used to 
 control CPRS access. Users are authenticated and initially authorized against
 their local VistA system.  All VistAWeb connections use visitor accounts. 
 VistAWeb requests look to a site almost exactly like local CPRS requests. The
 only way the site could distinguish between the two is by noting ("seeing") 
 the data retrieval is accomplished utilizing a visitor account. There is no 
 method in place to monitor visitor account remote access queries within 
 VistAWeb. Nor is there an identified developed mechanism to limit the 
 number of queries to remote systems.
  
 VistAWeb is accessible through the CPRS Tools menu and will permit VistAWeb 
 users to retrieve data from other VistA systems utilizing a web interface.  
 VistAWeb permits access to two classifications of users:
 (1) CPRS Users and (2) "Special Users", e.g., administrators, researchers 
 and clerks.  A list of individuals who are granted "Special User" status 
 is maintained in the VistAWeb server located at the Silver Spring Office of 
 Information in Silver Spring, MD.  VistAWeb only manages the authorization 
 of the "Special User" access.
  
 Existing VistA Fileman and Kernel conventions for data storage and job 
 tasking is used.  VistAWeb times out after 15 minutes of non-use with a 
 2 minute warning message before emptying the contents of the browser.
  
 Any VistAWeb page that would otherwise leave patient identifiers or 
 patient data in the Temporary Internet Files folder, has its cache shut off 
 to prevent leaving this sensitive data on client machines.

 Instructions
 ============
 This patch contains instructions on how to add VistAWeb to the CPRS Tools 
 Menu. Further instructions are provided on how to add a link on the Windows 
 Desktop to VistAWeb.
  
 A. Adding CPRS User Hyperlink to the CPRS Tools Menu
  
   1. There are two paths available to add the VistAWeb hyperlink to the 
        CPRS Tools Menu
      Path #1
        a. At Select OPTION NAME: <type> ORMGR
        b. From Select CPRS Manager Menu Option: <type> PE (CPRS        
           Configuration (Clin Coord) ...)
        c. From Select CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) Option: <type> GP
           (GUI Parameters...)
        d. From Select GUI Parameters Option: <type> TM (GUI Tool Menu 
           Items)

        b. From Select General Parameter Tools Option: <type> EP (Edit  
           Parameter Values)
        c. From Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: <type> ORWT TOOLS MENU
   2. From the list of parameter entities displayed, choose 4 to set the CPRS 
        GUI Tools Menu at the System level
   3. At the "Select Sequence:" prompt enter '?' to view the current items on
        the CPRS GUI Tools Menu
   4. Enter an appropriate sequence number.  For example, in the 
        following situation you would choose '5' for the new sequence 
        number:
  
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Sequence  Value
 --------  -----
 1         &Time=Clock.exe
 2         &Calculator=Calc.exe
 3         &Windows Introduction=WinHlp32 Windows.hlp
 4         &Notepad=Notepad.exe
  
  
  
 Select Sequence: 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
   5. Enter 'YES' when asked "Are you adding ## as a new Sequence? Yes//"
   6. At the "Name=Command:" prompt enter VistAWeb="Hyperlink"' where 
        "hyperlink" is the string given to your site.
   7. Now you can exit the option and verify that the Menu item shows up.
  
  
 B. Adding the Stand Alone Hyperlink
  
   1. VistAWeb can be directly accessed by opening Internet Explorer and 
        entering the URL given to you for VistAWeb in the address bar.
  
   2. To add a link to VistAWeb onto the Windows Desktop perform the 
        following: 
  
        a. Access VistAWeb by performing the instructions given in B.1.
        b. On the Internet Explorer Menubar choose File...Send...Shortcut 
                to Desktop
        c. Go to the Windows Desktop and look for the new Internet Explorer 
                Icon
        d. Right click on the icon and select Rename from the popup menu
        e. Rename the icon to VistAWeb.
  
 !!IMPORTANT!!
 The VistAWeb application utilizes pop-ups.  Field facilities who have 
 chosen to turn off pop-ups on desktops will need to follow the steps 
 below to allow pop-up windows in VistAWeb to open.  These steps do not 
 require the field  to "turn on" all pop-ups on workstations, but pop-ups 
 for the VistAWeb application only.  Sites can allow pop-up windows to open 
 in a Web site by adding the Web site to the Allowed sites list by following 
 these steps. 
  
 1. Click Start, point to All Programs, and then click Internet Explorer.
 2. On the Tools menu, point to Pop-up Blocker, and then click Pop-up Blocker   
        Settings.
 3. In the "Address of Web site to allow" box, type the address of the Web 
        site, and then click Add. 
 4. Click Close.
   
 
 VistAWeb is CCOW Compliant
 ==========================
 If VistAWeb is launched on a PC without CCOW Client Components a message 
 will be displayed that states:  VistAWeb is CCOW compliant and has been 
 unsuccessful in locating a CCOW vault.  Please contact your local IRM for 
 assistance.   The application (VistAWeb) will then Exit.
