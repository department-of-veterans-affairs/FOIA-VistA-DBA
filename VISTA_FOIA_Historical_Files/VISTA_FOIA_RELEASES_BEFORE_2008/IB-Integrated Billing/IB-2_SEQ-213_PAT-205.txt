Subject: THIRD PARTY FOLLOW-UP REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to address a request from the Veterans
 Affairs Central Office, (VACO), to generate data for the Third Party
 follow-up reports from the date of care to the date the report is run.
  
 VACO has requested an additional prompt be added to the generation of the
 Third Party Follow-up reports, allowing the report be run for outstanding
 AR that will calculate from the date of care or discharge date, to the
 date the report is run. The report will look at the STATEMENT TO field of
 file 399 BILL/CLAIMS, where the date filed is the date of care for an
 outpatient event and the discharge date for an inpatient stay. The report
 will calculate from that date to the date the report is run.
  
 Currently, the Third Party Follow-up report measures the percentage of
 claims by the age of the claims.  The age is determined by calculating the
 date the bill became active in AR to the date the report is run. It has
 been decided to keep this date calculation also, to measure time in AR.
  
 An additional prompt has been added to the Third Party Follow-up Report
 and the Third Party Summary Reports allowing the user to choose how the
 report should be generated, either by date of care or active in AR.
 Routines IBJDF1,IBJDF11,IBJDF12,IBJDF1H and IBJDF2 have been modified for
 this purpose. 
  
 Changes have been made to the following fields in file 351.7.
  
 Fields          1            INPUT VARIABLE  (multiple)
 Subfield:       1            INPUT STATEMENT
 Variables:                   IBSDATE
