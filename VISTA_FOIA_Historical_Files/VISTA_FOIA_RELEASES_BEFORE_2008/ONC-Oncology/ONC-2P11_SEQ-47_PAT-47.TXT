 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator.
 
 This patch will implement the EDITS API.  
 This patch satisfies IT Service Request #20050803.
 
 When the registrar attempts to set the ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91) to 3
 (Complete), three things will occur:
 
 1) The program will first check to make sure that all of the "required"
    data items have been filled in.  This is currently being done.
 
 2) Once all of the "required" data items have been filled in, the program
    will pass the abstract through a series of local inter-field edit checks.
    This is also currently being done.
 
 3) Once all of the local inter-field edit checks have been resolved (or
    overridden), the program will invoke the EDITS API and pass the abstract
    through the EDITS application.  This feature is new with this patch.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Example:
 
 ABSTRACT STATUS: Incomplete// Complete
 
  All required data fields have been entered.
 
  Beginning inter-field edit checks...
 
  No inter-field edit check warnings.
 
  Calling EDITS API...   <--new with this patch
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 If the EDITS API encounters errors the error messages will be displayed
 followed by the following message:
 
    EDITS errors were encountered. ABSTRACT STATUS is unchanged.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Example:
 
  Calling EDITS API...
 
   1. Date of Last Contact, Date of Diag. (NAACCR IF19)
     E:Date of Diagnosis and Date of Last Contact conflict 
         Date of Diagnosis (283)             = 12092004 
         Date of Last Contact (1294)         = 09052003 
 
 RETURN to continue, '^' to exit, or Edit# for help:
 
 Edit Set                                            Errors  Warnings
 --------------------------------------------------  ------  --------
 Veterans Administration                                  1         0
 
 EDITS errors were encountered. ABSTRACT STATUS is unchanged.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTE:
 Each error will be numbered sequentially.  If the registrar wishes to see
 additional information about a specific error, he/she may enter the sequential
 error number after the "RETURN to continue, '^' to exit, or Edit# for help:"
 prompt for additional error information.
 
 If EDITS errors are encountered, the registrar should then review the error
 messages and resolve any data conflicts.
 
 If the EDITS API does not encounter any errors the program will do the
 following:
 
   -ABSTRACT STATUS will be set to 3 (Complete)
   -A unique checksum value will be computed for the abstract
   -DATE CASE COMPLETED will be set to the current date
   -ABSTRACTED BY will be set to the registrar who 'completed' the abstract
 
 The following messages will be displayed:
 
  No EDITS errors or warnings.
 
  ABSTRACT STATUS.......: Complete
  DATE CASE COMPLETED...: 03/21/2007
  ABSTRACTED BY.........: REGISTAR,TEST
  DATE CASE LAST CHANGED: 
  CASE LAST CHANGED BY..: 
 
  Computing checksum value for this abstract...
 
 Once an abstract has successfully passed through the EDITS API and its ABSTRACT
 STATUS set to 3 (Complete), if the registrar makes a change which will affect
 the abstract's NAACCR record, he/she will see the following message:
 
  You have made a change to a 'Completed' abstract.
  This abstract needs to be re-run through the EDITS API.
 
  Calling EDITS API...
 
 If no EDITS errors are encountered the registrar will see the following
 message:
 
  No EDITS errors or warnings.  ABSTRACT STATUS = 3 (Complete).
 
 If EDITS errors are encountered the registrar will see the following message:
 
  EDITS errors were encountered.
 
  The ABSTRACT STATUS has been changed to 0 (Incomplete).
 
 Each time a 'complete' abstract is changed the abstract will be date-stamped
 with the date of the most recent change and the name of registrar making the
 change.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In addition to implementing the EDITS API this patch contains the following
 enhancements and problem resolutions:
 
  1) NAACCR Version 11.1
 
     NAACCR Version 11.1 has been implemented with this patch.  To support this
     implementation the following additions/modifications have been made:
 
     a) The following new data items have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY
     (#165.5) file:
 
     AMBIGUOUS TERMINOLOGY DX (#165.5,159)
     DATE OF CONCLUSIVE DX    (#165.5,193)
     MULT TUM RPT AS ONE PRIM (#165.5,194)
     DATE OF MULTIPLE TUMORS  (#165.5,195)
     MULTIPLICITY COUNTER     (#165.5,196)
 
     These data items have been placed in the "Cancer Identification" section of
     the abstract and will only appear for 2007+ cases.
 
     b) STATE AT DX (#165.5,16)
 
     The description of code ZZ has been changed:
      Old description: US, NOS; Canada, NOS; Unknown
      New description: Residence unknown
 
     Two new codes have been added:
      CD (Resident of Canada, NOS)
      US (Resident of United States, NOS)
 
     c) MANAGING PHYSICIAN (#165.5,2.2)
 
     With the implementation of FORDS in patch ONC*2.11*36, data item MANAGING
     PHYSICIAN was discontinued.  This data item is being reactivated to support
     NAACCR Version 11.1 data item NPI--PHYSICIAN-MANAGING [2465] 2595-2604.
     MANAGING PHYSICIAN is required for cases diagnosed on or after January 1,
     2007.
 
  2) STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC (#165.5,88) computation using CLINICAL M
     Following message was received from Jerri Linn Phillips, the Manager --
     Information, Technology, and Data Standards Section, National Cancer Data
     Base, Commission on Cancer:
 
     "The experts on the AJCC Executive Committee agreed without exception that
     the intent is that staging for metastatic disease is 'clinical' unless
     there is pathologic information confirming he presence of distant
     metastases.  There are no circumstances of 'pM0.'  Further, the assumption
     should be 'cM0' unless there is clinical or pathological evidence of
     metasteses.  There are extremely few if any circumstances of 'Mx' disease. 
   
     For computing pathologic stage, use pT and pN.  Then, if pM is 1, 1A, 1B,
     1C, or 1M use it; otherwise use the value of cM (whether it is blank, cMX,
     cM0, cM1, cM1a, cM1b, cM1c or 88) to calculate pathologic stage group."
 
     As per these instructions, the algorithm for computing STAGE GROUP
     PATHOLOGIC has been changed to use CLINICAL M in lieu of PATHOLOGIC M in
     the event that PATHOLOGIC M is not 1, 1A, 1B, 1C or 1M.  If CLINCIAL M is
     used the following message will be displayed:
 
     CLINICAL M will be used to calculate PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUPING.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Example:
 
     CLINICAL T: T1 2 cm or less in greatest dimension
     CLINICAL N: N0 No regional lymph node metastasis 
     CLINICAL M: M0 No distant metastasis
 
              Computed CLINICAL STAGE GROUPING: I (T1 N0 M0)
 
     PATHOLOGIC T: T1 2 cm or less in greatest dimension
     PATHOLOGIC N: N0 No regional lymph node metastasis
     PATHOLOGIC M: MX Distant metastasis cannot be assessed
 
              CLINICAL M will be used to calculate PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUPING.
 
              Computed PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUPING: I (T1 N0 M0)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  3) Duplicate entries in COUNTY (#5.1) file      
 
     There were two SAN DIEGO entries in the COUNTY file for the state of
     California.  The duplicate entry has been deleted.  Any abstracts with a
     COUNTY AT DX (#165.5,10) value which pointed to the deleted entry have had
     their COUNTY AT DX values converted to the remaining SAN DIEGO entry.
 
  4) OTHER STAGING SYSTEM (#165.5,39)
 
     a) In patch ONC*2.11*45 we retired the data item OTHER STAGE for all 2006+
     cases.  This was done as per the NAACCR 2006 Implementation Guidelines
     and Recommendations.  It has been requested that this data item be
     reactivated for all cases for VACCR use.
 
     b) In order to be consistent with NAACCR terminology the data item OTHER
     STAGE has been renamed OTHER STAGING SYSTEM.
 
     c) For 2007+ cases the OTHER STAGING SYSTEM choices are restricted to the
     C-D-S, RAI, D-S, FAB, EXTENSIVE and LIMITED choices.
        
     d) OTHER STAGING SYSTEM has been added to VACCR EXTRACT V11 record layout in
     columns [1513-1527].
 
  5) No AJCC TNM staging
 
     a) LENTIGO MALIGNA MELANOMA (8742/3)
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*44 "no staging" stuffing logic was added for LENTIGO
     MALIGNA (8742/2) and LENTIGO MALIGNA MELANOMA (8742/3).  This stuffing was
     incorrect for 8742/3.  LENTIGO MALIGNA MELANOMA (8742/3) is stageable.
     LENTIGO MALIGNA (8742/2) is not.  8742/3 has been removed from the "no
     staging" stuffing logic.
 
     b) Carcinoid tumors
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*43 we implemented "no staging" stuffing for carcinoid
     tumors of the following sites:
 
     C16.  STOMACH
     C17.  SMALL INTESTINE
     C23.9 GALLBLADDER
     C24.  EXTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCTS/AMPULLA OF VATER
     C25.  EXOCRINE PANCREAS
 
     This list has been expanded in this patch to include:
 
     C18.  COLON
     C19.9 RECTOSIGMOID JUNCTION
     C20.9 RECTUM NOS
     C21.  ANAL CANAL
       
     This change will mimic the Collaborative Staging TNM coding/staging
     computation for carcinoid tumors of these sites.
    
     c) GIST of PANCREAS, HEAD (C25.0)
 
     There is no TNM coding or staging schema for AJCC 6th Edition PANCREAS,
     HEAD (C25.0) cases with an HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) value of GIST
     (GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL) (8936/0, 8936/1, 8936/2 or 8936/3).
     For these cases the TNM and staging fields will be stuffed with the
     "no staging" values.
 
     d) PANCREAS, ISLETS (C25.4)
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*44 we implemented "no staging" stuffing for PANCREAS,
     ISLETS (C25.4) cases combined with specific histology values.  In this
     patch we are removing the histology test.  All PANCREAS, ISLETS (C25.4)
     cases will now be stuffed with the "no staging" values.
 
     e) MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES (9700/3) AND SEZARY DISEASE (9701/3) OF SKIN, VULVA,
     PENIS, SCROTUM
     C44.0-C44.9, C51.0-C51.9, C60.0-C60.9, C63.2
      
     Sixth Edition Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Disease of Skin, Vulva, Penis
     and Scrotum cases have a TNM staging schema.  These cases were being
     stuffed with "no staging" values.  This was incorrect.  These cases may be
     staged.
 
     NOTE: Pre-Sixth Edition Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Disease cases and
     Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Disease cases with primary sites other than
     Skin, Vulva, Penis or Scrotum do not have a TNM staging schema.  Their TNM
     fields will be stuffed with the appropriate "no staging" values.
 
  6) Excluding sensitive patient data from the Complete Abstract (132c)
 
     When the registrar chooses to print the Complete Abstract (132c) he/she will
     now see the following prompt:
 
     Exclude sensitive patient data? No//
 
     If the registrar answers "YES", the following data item values will be
     masked from display:
 
     PATIENT NAME
     SSN
     HOME STREET ADDRESS
     HOME CITY
 
     ADDRESS AT DX
     ADDRESS AT DX - SUPP
     CITY/TOWN AT DX
     TELEPHONE
     NEXT OF KIN
 
  7) DATE DX (#165.5,3)
 
     According to FORDS (page 89), DATE DX should be coded 99999999 "when the
     date of initial diagnosis is unknown".  The registrars were not allowed
     to enter a DATE DX value of 99/99/9999.  This has been fixed.
 
  8) FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA, GRADE 3 (9698/3)
 
     For FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA, GRADE 3 (9698/3), if GRADE/DIFF/CELL TYPE was not
     1 (Grade 1), the following inter-field edit warning was displayed when the
     registrar set the ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91) to 3 (Complete).
 
     WARNING: HISTOLOGY = FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA, GRADE 3
              GRADE/DIFF/CELL TYPE must be 1 (Grade 1)
 
     This inter-field edit has been removed.
 
  9) FOL *..Follow-up Functions ... [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU]
      FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ... [ONCO FOLL PROCEDURE MENU]
       PL Print Follow-up Letter [ONCO FOLL-PRINT LETTER]
 
     If the registrar selected a second patient within a single [PL Print
     Follow-up Letter] session, the LAST FOLLOW-UP CONTACT (#160,15.1) value
     from the first patient would be carried over to the second patient.  This
     has been fixed.
  
     This item resolves Remedy ticket #173364.
 
 10) SEQUENCE NUMBER--CENTRAL [380] 281-282
 
     The NAACCR data item SEQUENCE NUMBER--CENTRAL was being extracted with a
     value 88 or 99 (depending on BEHAVIOR CODE).  This was incorrect.
     SEQUENCE NUMBER--CENTRAL should have a value of <BLANK>.  This has been
     fixed.
 
     NOTE: This change backs out part of item 8 of patch ONC*2.11*46.
 
 11) [UTL *..Utility Options ...]
       [CC Create State/VACCR Data Download]
 
     The [CC Create State/VACCR Data Download] has been enhanced.  The registrar
     may now use either DATE CASE COMPLETED or DATE CASE LAST CHANGED for the
     Start/End date range.
 
     e.g.
     Select *..Utility Options Option: CC  Create State/VACCR Data Download
     DISPLAY/PRINT on-line instructions? No//   NO
 
     Available record layouts:
 
     1) VACCR Record Layout v11.1 (VA Registry)
     2) NAACCR State Record Layout v11.1
 
     Select record layout: 1  VACCR Record Layout v11.1
 
     Facility Identification Number (FIN): 6211145// 
     Select date field to be used for Start/End range: ?
 
     Select the date field you wish to use for this download's Start/End 
     range prompts.
 
      Select one of the following:
 
           1         Date Case Completed
           2         Date Case Last Changed
 
 12) New inter-field edit checks
 
     New inter-field edit checks have been added which will check for the
     presence of codes 88 and 88/88/8888 in the following data items and,
     if found, prohibit the registrar from 'completing' the abstract.
 
     The following data items will be checked for code 88 (Recommended, unknown
     if admin):
 
     CHEMOTHERAPY
     CHEMOTHERAPY @FAC
     HORMONE THERAPY
     HORMONE THERAPY @FAC
     IMMUNOTHERAPY
     IMMUNOTHERAPY @FAC
     HEMA TRANS/ENDOCRINE PROC
 
     The following data items will be checked for date values of 88/88/8888:
 
     DATE RADIATION STARTED
     RADIATION @FACILITY DATE
     DATE RADIATION ENDED
     CHEMOTHERAPY DATE
     CHEMOTHERAPY @FAC DATE
     HORMONE THERAPY DATE
     HORMONE THERAPY @FAC DATE
     IMMUNOTHERAPY DATE
     IMMUNOTHERAPY @FAC DATE
     HEMA TRANS/ENDOCRINE PROC DAT
 
 13) TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE (#165.5,1.2)
     DATE OF NO TREATMENT (#165.5,124) stuffing
     REASON NO SURGERY OF PRIMARY (#165.5,58)
 
     If TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE = 6 (Autopsy only) or 7 (Death certificate
     only) and a DATE OF NO TREATMENT has been entered, the program will now 
     stuff REASON NO SURGERY OF PRIMARY with 9 (Unknown).
 
 14) TIMELINESS REPORT
 
     A new option, [TIME Timeliness Report], has been added to the [UTL
     *..Utility Options...] menu.  This option will compute the percentage of
     cases within the selected date range which have an ELAPSED DAYS TO
     COMPLETION value less than 180 days.
