Subject: NEW PATIENT RECORD INCOMPLETE 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ******************************************************************
 NOTE:  A 10-day compliance is requested because of the impact this
        problem is causing to the MPI Exception processing.
 ******************************************************************
  
 This patch concerns a situation where an incomplete patient record
 is temporarily created when adding a new patient, and incorrect
 text in the definition of an option.   
  
 ASSOCIATED NOISes:
 ==================
 ISB-0804-31946     Creation of PATIENT file record with just the .01
 PUG-0604-51690     Inconsistency purge not working

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 1) ISB-0804-31946     Creation of PATIENT file record with just the .01
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When adding a new patient using the Registration options, after the 
 basic identifier prompts have been answered, the message "patient
 being added" is displayed and the user is offered the option to modify
 the patient name components. But by then the patient file stub record
 has already been created with the name that was initially entered, and 
 if there is a delay in responding to the patient name components,
 automatic background processes will start with only the initial name
 in the record. One such process is the MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES option 
 which needs the other identifiers to properly process the record. 
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine DPTLK2 will be modified to file a complete record before
 the user is offered the option to modify the patient name components.
  
 2)  PUG-0604-51690     Inconsistency purge not working
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The description text of the option DG CONSISTENCY PURGE does not agree
 with the text displayed by the routine it invokes.  The option
 description implies that appointment data is looked at when it is not.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The description text of the option will be changed from:
  
 "the option will check each patient to see if he she has been admitted,
  registered or had an appointment since that past date."
  
 to:
  
 "the option will check each patient to see if he/she has been admitted 
  or registered since that date.

 INSTALLATIONS INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the 
 impact on users of the Registration package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*615):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*615.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? YES//', answer NO
  
 7.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

     you would like to place out of order, enter:
      Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
  
 9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
