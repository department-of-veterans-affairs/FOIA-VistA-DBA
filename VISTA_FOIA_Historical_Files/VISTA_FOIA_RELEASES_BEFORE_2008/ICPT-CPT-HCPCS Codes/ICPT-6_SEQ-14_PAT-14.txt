   This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
   Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
   routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
   the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
   implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
   and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
   This patch is one of three installs contained in a combined KIDS 
   distribution:
  
       CSV UTIL 1.0
  
           LEX*2.0*25
           ICD*18.0*6
           ICPT*6.0*14
  
   The combined distribution consist of both a KIDS host file and a data
   global host file:
  
       KIDS Distribution        CSV_UTIL_1_0.KID
       Data Global              CSV_UTIL_1_0.GBL
 
   Installing the CSV UTIL 1.0 build provides all of the updates
   listed below.  Sites will use the Multi-Build Distribution to
   ensure the proper order of installation for the LEX, CPT, and
   ICD utilities.
 
   This update includes additions and modifications to entries in the
   CPT file (#81), and the CPT MODIFIER file (#81.3).

   NEW PROTOCOL
   ============
 
       ICPT CODE UPDATE EVENT has been added to notify subscribing
       applications of a CPT Code Update.
  
  
   NEW APIs
   ========
 
 
       The following APIs are nationally supported.  Refer to DBIA #1995,
       and DBIA #1997 for details concerning input parameters and output
       of the calls.
   
 
       $$CODEC^ICPTCOD
       Extrinsic function call converts an Internal Entry Number into a
       CPT or HCPCS code.
   
       $$CODEN^ICPTCOD
       Extrinsic function call converts the CPT or HCPCS code into an
       Internal Entry Number.
   
       $$STATCHK^ICPTAPIU
       Extrinsic function call returns whether or not a given CPT or
       HCPCS code is active or inactive on a given date.
   
       $$NEXT^ICPTAPIU
       Extrinsic function call returns the next CPT or HCPCS Code
       (active or inactive).
   
       $$PREV^ICPTAPIU
       Extrinsic function call returns the previous CPT or HCPCS Code
       (active or inactive).
   
       $$HIST^ICPTAPIU
       Extrinsic function call returns the activation history of a
       CPT or HCPCS Code.
   
       PERIOD^ICPTAPIU
       Function call to retrieve the activation/inactivation pairs
       of a CPT Code.
   
   
   MODIFIED APIs
   =============
 
       $$CPT^ICPTCOD and $$MODT^ICPTMOD
       --------------------------------
 
       The output of the function call has been augmented to contain the
       Inactivation Date, the Activation Date, and an alert that Code text
       may be inaccurate.
   
   
       $$CPTD^ICPTCOD
       --------------
 
       The output of the function call has been augmented to contain an
       alert that Code text may be inaccurate.
