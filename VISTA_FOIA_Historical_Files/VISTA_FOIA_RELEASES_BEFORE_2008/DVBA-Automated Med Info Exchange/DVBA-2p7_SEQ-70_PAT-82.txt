 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1)  ISP-1004-N2098   NEW GENITOURINARY EXAM WORKSHEET
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Dr. Audrey Tomlinson (VACO) has requested an update to the current
     AMIE worksheet for GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION, to change one of the
     existing paragraphs on the worksheet.
  
     Resolution:

     a)  Created post-install routine DVBA82PI which will deactivate the
         current GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION worksheet in the AMIE Exam
         file (396.6 - IEN 107) and create and activate the new
         GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION entry in file 396.6 (IEN 194).
     b)  Created routine DVBCWGE3 that contains the text for the new
         GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION worksheet.
     c)  Created routine DVBCWGE2 to access the text routine in b), and
         print the new GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION worksheet.
