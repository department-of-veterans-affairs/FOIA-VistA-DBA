 PROJECT OVERVIEW
 ================
   This IB patch addresses changes required by The Interim Address 
 Enhancements (IAE) project. 
   The patch DG*5.3*522 that was issued as a part of the Interim Address 
 Enhancements (IAE) project introduced a new API call EN^DGREGAED 
 (Integration Agreement #4198) that allows the user to edit patient's
 address. The new API call handles selection of multiple cities for a
 single zip code. 
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
 ======================
   This INTEGRATED BILLING patch modifies the IB software to use the new
 API call EN^DGREGAED to edit a patient address thru the IB menu option [IB
 EDIT BILLING INFO] Enter/Edit Billing Information. The modification allows
 the user to select a city from the list of cities for the zip code
 specified. Also it automatically populates COUNTY and STATE fields.
  
 Here is an example of the updated user interface for address edit:
  
 <RET> to CONTINUE, 1-7 to EDIT, '^N' for screen N, or '^' to QUIT: 5
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1]: STR LINE 1// STR LINE 1
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2]: STR LINE 2// STR LINE 2
 STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3]: STR LINE 3// STR LINE 3
 ZIP+4: 72003// 01002
