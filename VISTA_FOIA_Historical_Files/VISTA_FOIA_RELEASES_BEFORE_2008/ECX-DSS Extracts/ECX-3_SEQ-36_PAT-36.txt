Subject: CORRECTIONS TO PROSTHETICS REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  I.  FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   This patch will correct two DSS Prosthetics reports which were not
   working correctly due to the addition and realignment of fields in the
   PROSTHETICS EXTRACT file (#727.826) which was part of the DSS FY 2001
   software release. The patch will allow current fiscal year data to be
   calculated and displayed correctly.
  
   1)  The Prosthetics (PRO) YTD Laboratory Report [ECX PRO LAB REPORT] was
       no longer printing values for the cost of transaction, lab labor
       cost, and lab material cost.
  
       This was reported in NOIS SDC-0201-61689.
  
  
   2)  The Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit Report [ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT]
       was not printing single line item information within the report.
  
       This was reported in NOIS HUN-0201-20549 and NOIS NOL-0301-70167.

         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
