Subject: FIX BOILERPLATE 'TRY' FUNCTION AND PROMPTS IN TIU REVIEW SCREEN MRT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 problems. 1) Fixes the "TRY" protocol when editing 
 TIU document boilerplate text. If a document returns a multiple value it 
 can in certain cases create a <SYNTAX> error. This was fixed in the main 
 boilerplate RPC with TIU*1.0*201. That same fix is being applied to the 
 "TRY"protocol. 2) In the Multiple Patient Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN 
 MRT] option the user can not "^" back to the STATUS prompt from the
 CLINICAL DOCUMENTS prompt if they have already entered a value at the
 CLINICAL DOCUMENTS prompt and returned to that prompt by entering an "^"
 at the Start Entry Date prompt.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED E3R(S):
 =================
 N/A 
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ==================
 133386: Prompts do not correctly handle '^"
 134556: Error in rare cases running the TRY protocol for boilerplate text
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 Problem 1:
    A progress note that containing 2 objects on one line of boilerplate 
 text, where 1 of the objects returns a multiple value can under certain 
 circumstances either error with a <SYNTAX> error or not display one of 
 the objects data.
  
 Solution 1:
    Improve the way the code parses the incoming result from the object so 
 that it can handle these situations properly.
  
 Problem 2:
    In the option Multiple Patient Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MRT] the
 user can not "^" from the prompt Select CLINICAL DOCUMENTS Type(s): to
 move back to the STATUS prompt if they have already moved forward to the
 Start Entry Date prompt and entered "^" to return to the CLINICAL DOCUMENT
 prompt. Instead they move forward to the Start Entry Date prompt
 regardless of their response. 
  
 Solution 2:
    Allow the user to move backwards from this prompt as they can from the 
 others.
