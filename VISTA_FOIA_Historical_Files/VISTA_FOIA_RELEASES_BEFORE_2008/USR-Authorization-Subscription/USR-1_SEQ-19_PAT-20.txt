Subject: Correct Business Rule, Expand Interdisciplinary message

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 ==============
  
 This patch provides the following two changes to the Authorized 
 Subscription System:
  
      1.  NOIS:  MIN-0601-40662.  The logical "OR" operand in an 
      Authorized/Subscription business rule is not working correctly.
  
      2.  E3R:  15978.  Spell out "ID" note in interdisciplinary error 
      message to the user.
   
 Change 1.  Correct Problem with "OR" logic in business rules.
 -------------------------------------------------------------
  
      When the routine USRLA was evaluating the "OR" logic the evaluation 
      process would stop after it evaluated the user class.  In the following 
      business rule the only person that would have been able to 
      "IDENTIFY SIGNERS" would have been the SURGICAL ROTATOR.
  
      A COMPLETED (TITLE) SURGERY CS CONSULT may HAVE SIGNERS IDENTIFIED by a 
      SURGICAL ROTATOR OR an AUTHOR/DICTATOR
  
      After the installation of this patch either the SURGICAL ROTATOR or the 
      AUTHOR/DICTATOR will be able to HAVE SIGNERS IDENTIFIED.
  
 Change 2.  Spell out "ID" note in interdisciplinary note error 
            message to the user.  
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  
      With the introduction of Interdisciplinary Notes and addition of 
      additional error messages presented to users it has been felt that the 
      more descriptive an error message can be the better, especially for 
      clinicians not at all involved with Interdisciplinary Notes.  The 
      following error messages have been expanded to replace "ID" with 
      "Interdisciplinary".
  
      You may not ATTACH this COMPLETED REHAB CHILD NURSE NOTE to an 
      interdisciplinary note.
  
      You may not ATTACH AN INTERDISCIPLINARY ENTRY TO this COMPLETED REHAB 
      PARENT TREATMENT PLAN.
