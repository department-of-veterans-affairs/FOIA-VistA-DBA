Subject: ACOS Annual Call for Data 1996 Extract

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch will enhance Oncology 2.11 to support the Commission on
 Cancers 1996 Annual Call for Data extract and will include the 1995 
 Bladder Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) for the National Cancer Database.
 The following modifications have been made.
           
      1)  The Option "Create ACOS Data Disk" (ONCO #SITE-CREATE ACOS 
          DISK) has been enhanced.
          a)  This option has been enhanced to include the 1995 
              Bladder PCE.
          b)  The patch includes a new data dictionary and data for file
              160.16 (ONCOLOGY DATA EXTRACT FORMAT).
          c)  Twelve new routines name spaced ONCACD* have been added 
              to support the Commission on Cancer Annual Call for Data 
              report.
       
      2)  Transfer of the data to disk has been improved.
          a)  The pre-installation routine ONCPRE9 will remove data
              from file 160.2 (FORMS/INSTRUCTIONS) so that the instructions
              can be updated correctly.
          b)  File 160.2 (FORMS/INSTRUCTIONS) has been modified 
              to reflect the new data help instrutions displayed/printed
              when creating the ACOS data disk.
          c)  The data will no longer need to be run through the 
              QBASIC conversion routine.
       
      3)  The option "Create a report to preview ACOS output" (ONCO
          #SITE-CREATE ACOS REPORT) has been modified to reflect the 1996
          North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR)
          data layout.
          a)  The new report will use the new fields in file 160.16 
              (ONCOLOGY DATA EXTRACT FORMAT).
          b)  The improved report will display all the new data fields
              to show an accurate representation of the database.
      
      4)  Two options have been modified to use the new files.
          a)  The option "Create ACOS Data Disk" (ONCO #SITE-CREATE 
              ACOS DISK) has been changed to use the new Annual 
              Call for Data routines.
          b)  The option "Create a report to preview ACOS output"
              (ONCO #SITE-CREATE ACOS REPORT) has been changed 
              to use the new Annual Call for Data routines.
