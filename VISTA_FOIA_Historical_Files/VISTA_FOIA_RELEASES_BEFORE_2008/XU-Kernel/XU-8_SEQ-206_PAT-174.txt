Subject: MODIFY FORWARDING OF UNREAD ALERTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 Alerts are used to send time sensitive notifications for information or
 for further processing.  When created, some alerts may specify a number of
 days for forwarding to a supervisor or to e-mail surrogates.  If the alert
 remains unread after this period of time the alert is forwarded, if
 possible, to a supervisor or e-mail surrogate as indicated.  A problem has
 been reported when after the alert has been forwarded to the backup
 individual, it is repeatedly reforwarded on following days until the alert
 is removed either manually or as a result of normal alert removal
 (SHR-0100-70069).  This patch corrects this behavior, so the alert will
 only be forwarded once.
  
 In addition, there have been some who wanted these unread alerts forwarded
 to a specific individual, e.g., someone in QA, who would monitor unread
 alerts and could insure forwarding to proper individuals if they could not
 process them fully (ASH-0100-31970).  To assist in this capability, the
 current patch also adds a 'DAYS FOR BACKUP REVIEWER' (#.15) field to the
 'ALERT DATE/TIME(#1)' subfile of the 'ALERT(#8992)' file.  In addition, it
 adds an 'XQAL BACKUP REVIEWER' entry in the PARAMETER DEFINITION 
 (#8989.51) file, and an option, Set Backup Reviewer for Alerts [XQAL SET
 BACKUP REVIEWER] on the Alert Management [XQALERT MGR] menu.
  
 If an alert is generated with a number of days specified in the variable
 XQAREVUE, after the specified number of days has passed if the alert
 remains unread, and if a valid entry is present in the ALERT BACKUP
 REVIEWER parameter for the User, Service, Division, or System 
 entities, the alert will be forwarded to the indicated individual
 at the lowest level found for processing.

 Installation Instructions:
  
      1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
      installation.
  
      2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
      3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
      System) package onto your system.
  
      4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
      5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options:
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
  
            Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":
            Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                =======
             Install Package(s)
             Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*174
                                  ==========
  
         Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES//
         NO 
         ==
         Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
                                                               ==
         Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
         YES// NO
               ==
  
      6.  AXP Sites - Answer 'NO' to the question 'Want to MOVE
      routines to other CPUs?'.
  
      7.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
