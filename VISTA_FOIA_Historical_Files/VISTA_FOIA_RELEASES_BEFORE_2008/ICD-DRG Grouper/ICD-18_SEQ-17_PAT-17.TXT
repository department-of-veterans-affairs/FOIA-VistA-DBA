  TICKET OVERVIEW:
  ================
  
 1) HD 66607    PTF grouping to wrong DRG in VistA
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE codes 36.12, 36.13 or 36.14 gives 
 DRG 470 UNGROUPABLE.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The IDENTIFIER (#2) field in ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1) 
 was modified to include a "6".  
  
 2) HD 64460    PUG-1204-50050  DRG Grouper Error
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Bone marrow transplants are generating the wrong DRG.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Use of ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE codes 41.00 thru 41.09 should give
 DRG 481 regardless of the diagnosis being used because bone marrow
 transplants are "pre-MDC".  Routine ICDDRG0 has been modified.
  
 3) HD 87443    DRG Problems
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of primary diagnosis 309.81 gives DRG 429 instead of 427.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The diagnosis code has been corrected by removing the October 1,2004 
 entry for DRG Grouper Effective Date and the 2004 entry for
 MDC Effective Date.
  
 4) HD 65287    Incorrect DRG link
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of operation/procedure code 51.23 (LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY)
 with a primary diagnosis within MDC 7 (Major Diagnostic Category
 of HEPATOBILIARY & PANCREA) does not give DRGs 493/494. 
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The identifier field (#2) in ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1)
 was changed back from "Nz" to "TT" to signify a laparoscopic
 cholecystectomy.
 Routines ICDGTDRG and ICDREF were also modified, such that if the 
 MDC is not found under the DRG Grouper Effective Date for the 
 effective year, the software will look in the prior year.
  
 5) HD 66528    DRG Grouper produces incorrect DRG's
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 Operation code 80.51 had a superfluous entry under the DRG Grouper
 Effective Date for October 1,2004.  This could result in DRG 243
 being assigned instead of DRG 500.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The superfluous entry was removed.
  
 6) HD 93777    DRG problems on PTF
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of operation/procedure code 81.61 is causing the Grouper to 
 give DRG 496 instead of 497/498 because the IDENTIFIER (#2) field
 of the code contains an "F" signifying "combined spinal fusion".
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The "F" was removed.
  
 7) HD 89251    DRG codes not correct
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Use of operation/procedure code 96.72 within Respiratory System (MDC 4)
 gives DRG 79 instead of 475.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routines ICDGTDRG and ICDREF were modified as explained in Problem (4).
  
 8) HD 86329    DRG should be 124 but calculates to 125
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When diagnosis code 402.91 is used with cardiac cath procedures,
 it gives DRG 125 instead of 124. The same is true for diag 428.32.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 An "X" was added to the IDENTIFIER (#2) field of each diagnosis.
 "X" signifies "cmplx/cmplctd".
  
 9) HD 96330   Trouble with DRGs
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Using operation/procedure code 01.59 without implant chemotherapy agent
 and without an acute complex cns principal diagnosis is giving DRG 543
 instead of DRG 1/2.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 In addition to DRG 543, DRGs 1/2/3 were added under the DRG
 Grouper Effective Date for October 1, 2004 for code 01.59.
  
 We also took the opportunity to review the assignment of DRGs 1,2,3,
 528 and new DRG 543 and made the following adjustments:
 a) made the same change done for code 01.59 to all other op codes
    in DRG 543;
 b) added a "K" to the IDENTIFIER (#2) field of diagnoses
    430., 431. and 432.9 so as to give DRG 528 instead of 543
    because of surgical hierarchy;
 c) added a "K" to the IDENTIFIER (#2) field of all op codes
    in DRG 528;
 d) modified routines ICDTLB1A, ICDTLB6A and ICDDRG1.  
    
 10) HD 97370  Problem with grouping
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Diagnosis 250.70 with secondary 785.4 with op/pro code 84.11 is
 giving DRG 7 instead of 114.
 When the description was changed for diagnosis 250.70, the MAJOR 
 DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORY (MDC) (#5) field was inadvertently changed from 
 5 (Circulatory System) to 1 (Nervous System).  
  
 Solution:
 =========
 The MDC field has been corrected to 5 (Circulatory System) and the
 DRG Grouper Effective Date entry for October 1, 2004 has been deleted,
 resulting in DRG 114.
  
 11) HD 99384   DRG ungroupable
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Diagnosis 428.0 is giving DRG 470 - Ungroupable.
  
 Solution
 ========
 Data related to the DRG Grouper Effective Date and MDC Effective Date
 was added to the record.  Use of the code (without others) now gives
 DRG 127.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   =========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.
   Installation should take less than 5 minutes.
  
   1. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   2. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*17)
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global. Routines ICD1817* can be removed once 
          the patch is installed.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
   3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*17.
  
   4. When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES//', respond NO
  
   5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
   6. Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
 DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs option in order to make the transfer DRGs
 correspond to the appropriate grouper.  This option updates/recalculates
 the transfer DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal year
 (since 10/1/2004).  
 The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
 is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for current
 FY.
  
   7. All routines ICD1817* can be deleted after the patch has been
      successfully installed.
