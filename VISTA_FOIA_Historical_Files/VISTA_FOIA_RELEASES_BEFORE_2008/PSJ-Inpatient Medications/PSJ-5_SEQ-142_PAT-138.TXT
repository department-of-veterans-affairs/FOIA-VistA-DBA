Subject: PROBLEM WITH UNIT DOSE COPY, IV ORDER EDIT, AND NV MAR LABEL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  1. An error occurs when an attempt is made to print a MAR label for a
  non-verified order. The error occurs when the software attempts to
  retrieve clinic appointment information from the non-verified order. Once
  the order is verified the MAR label prints without producing the error.
  This patch corrects this issue by correctly processing non-verified
  orders without appointment information. HD0000000068851
  
  2. Immediately after copying a unit dose order, if the order's schedule
  is edited, administration times and schedule frequency from the new
  schedule do not default into the copied order. This patch corrects this
  issue by using the administration times and schedule frequency from the
  newly entered schedule. HD0000000102178
  
  3. When changing an IV order's schedule from a continuous schedule to a
  one-time schedule with no frequency defined in the ADMINISTRATION
  SCHEDULE file (#51.1), the order's schedule interval is not updated,
  resulting in the order's IV labels printing based on the frequency of
  the original schedule. For example, if an IV order's schedule is changed
  from Q6H to ONCE, IV labels will continue to print based on the Q6H
  schedule, or 4 labels per day. This patch will require an order's
  schedule interval to be updated with the frequency from the new schedule.
