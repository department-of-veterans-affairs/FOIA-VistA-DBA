 REMEDY OVERVIEW:

 Remedy ticket:
 --------------
  HD0000000114675: Subscript error in PCE API ENCEVENT^PXKENC.
    Duplicates: HD0000000114639, HD0000000114933
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Subscript errors post CIDC patch PX*1.0*124 as a result of attempts
  to perform CIDC updates for encounters with null visit numbers.
  
 Resolution:
  ----------
  Changes were made to routines which prevent calling the PCE API
  ENCEVENT^PXKENC in the instance of null PCE visit numbers.
   
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Remedy ticket:
 --------------
  HD0000000113587: Exclusions required for the CIDC Missing Data Report(MDR).
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Encounter defects appear on the CIDC Missing Data Report which should not
  be listed.  The encounter defects and encounters that should be excluded
  from the MDR include:
    Historic encounters
    Test patients
    Child encounters
    Non-count clinics
    Missing Clinical indicators for Stop Codes in file #409.45
    Missing SC/EI classifications for Stop Codes in file #409.45
  
 Resolution:
  ----------
  Modify the MDR routines to exclude the above listed encounter defects
  and encounters from the MDR.
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Remedy ticket:
 --------------
  HD0000000113534: Missing disabilities during the clinical indicator prompts..
  
  Problem:
  --------
  In the cases where the number of disabilities exceed four, the scrolling
  window provided to display disabilities at the beginning of the
  clinical indicator classification prompts needs to be expanded.
  
 Resolution:
  ----------
  The solution is to provide for a full screen window to display the multiple
  disabilities, which includes elevator side bars to scroll back for
  disabilities which scroll off of the top of the display.
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Remedy ticket:
 --------------
  HD0000000115301: Environmental indicators AO, IR, and EC are retained when
                   editing NSC encounters to be SC.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When editing an encounter which has been identified as Non-Service
  Connected(NSC), if the encounter becomes Service Connected(SC), the
  Environmental Indicators(EI) Agent Orange(AO), Irradiation(IR), and
  Environmental Contaminants(EC) are being retained when they should
  not display.
  
 Resolution:
  ----------
  Force a delete of the classifications AO, IR and EC if an edited
  encounter switches from NSC to SC.
 Remedy ticket:
 --------------
  HD0000000115033: PCE encounters that are edited by DATA2PCE with new diagnoses
                   are having missing diagnosis SC/EI classifications defaulted
                   from the encounter level.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When an encounter already exists in PCE, for example, through a scheduled
  appointment, and DATA2PCE is used to added diagnoses, if the diagnoses
  are missing SC/EI classifications, these classifications are being
  incorrectly defaulted from the encounter level.
  
 Resolution:
  ----------
  Change the DATA2PCE routine that updates the diagnoses to retain any null
  clinical indicator SC/EI classifications that are being passed in by DATA2PCE.
  PCE will continue to perform error checking and not permit invalid data, and
  will continue to set to null AO, IR, and EC for SC diagnoses.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
  that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
      2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
         be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
      3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
      4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PX*1.0*174)
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
        d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
      5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
         PX*1.0*174.
  
  
      6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//" respond NO.
  
      7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
      8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
         returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
         completion.
  
   
   NOTE: Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided
         during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install
         File Print option on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation
         and Distribution System.
