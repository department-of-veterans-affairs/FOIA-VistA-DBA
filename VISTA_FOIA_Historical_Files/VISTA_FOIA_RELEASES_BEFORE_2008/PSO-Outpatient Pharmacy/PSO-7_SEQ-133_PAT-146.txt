Description:
============

 This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch for the Transitional Pharmacy
 Benefit Project (TPB) Phase II.
  
 1. An Environment check routine is included in the patch, and the install 
 will be aborted if either of the following 2 conditions are met. If you
 already have an entry named NON-VA in the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53),
 the install will be aborted, because this patch exports an entry with that
 same name. If you have not created an entry in the DOMAIN file (#4.2) 
 named "TPB-AUSTIN.MED.VA.GOV", the install will be aborted, because that
 domain is needed for the Health Level Seven (HL7) extracts of the TPB
 Patient information.
  
  
 2. A Post-Install routine is included that will scan the TPB ELIGIBILITY
 file (#52.91) and check each patient to see if that patient is flagged
 with a DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) entry in the PATIENT file (#2). If that
 patient has a DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) entry, and the patient is still
 active in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91), that patient will be marked
 inactive in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). The TPB Rx (Prescription) 
 Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY] option is a new stand-alone option for allowing 
 entry of TPB prescriptions. This option is sent out disabled and will not 
 be enabled until the Post-Install routine has run to completion.
  
  
 3. A new NVA code has been added to the SC/A&A/OTHER/INPATIENT field 
 (#6) of the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53). This code is used to distinguish
 prescriptions entered as part of the TPB project. The NVA code will 
 automatically be assigned to the NON-VA Rx Patient Status entry that is 
 being exported with this patch. This patch will change the field name to 
 the following: SC/A&A/OTHER/INPATIENT/NVA.
  
  
 4. A new field named TPB RX field (#201) has been added to the 
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The software will automatically set this field 
 to Yes for any prescription that meets all of the TPB requirements.
  
  
 5. The following fields were added to the NEW PERSON file (#200) by Kernel
 patch XU*8*311:
  
 53.91     NON-VA PRESCRIBER
 53.92     TAX ID
 53.93     EXCLUSIONARY CHECK PERFORMED
 53.94     DATE EXCLUSIONARY LIST CHECKED
 53.95     ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST
 53.96     EXCLUSIONARY CHECKED BY
  
 The following Outpatient Pharmacy options have been modified to allow the 
 editing of these new fields in the NEW PERSON file (#200):
  
 Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD]
 Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]
 View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] 
    
  
 6. The following fields have been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file 
 (#59.7). These fields will be used by the HL7 extracts of TPB Patient 
 information:
  
 46.1    TRANSMISSION START DATE
 46.2    TRANSMISSION END DATE
 46.3    BATCH CONTROL ID
 46.4    NUMBER OF MSH COUNT
 46.5    NUMBER OF LINES COUNT
  
 The HL7 extract will automatically be done on all patients upon initial 
 patch install, then the job will be automatically queued to run every 
 evening at 6:00pm, and the extract will check the day of the week, and 
 only send data on Sundays. In addition to the fields listed above, the 
 patch also exports the following to enable the HL7 extracts:
  
 OPTION:
    Queue Background Jobs [PSO AUTOQUEUE JOBS] 
    TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT]
  
 PROTOCOL:
    PSO TPB EV 
    PSO TPB SUB
  
 HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER:
    PSO TPB-AAC   
    PSO TPB-PHARM
  
 HL LOGICAL LINK:
    PSOTPBAAC   
  
  
 The TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option has 
 been added to the jobs that can be re-queued from the Queue Background 
 Jobs [PSO AUTOQUEUE JOBS] option.
                                   
  
 7. A new stand-alone option, TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX
 ENTRY], is being exported with this patch. This option will provide the
 capability to enter TPB prescriptions for TPB eligible patients. Included
 in this option will be the ability to enter/edit Provider Information, and
 the ability to enter/edit Allergy information. Only patients eligible for
 the TPB benefit will be selectable through this option. When entering the
 prescription information, the Rx Patient Status must be NON-VA, and the
 Provider that is selected for the prescription must meet the following 2
 criteria: the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field (#53.91) in the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) must be set to Yes, and the ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST field (#53.95)
 in the NEW PERSON file (#200) must be set to No. Any prescription entered,
 verified, or completed through this option will be flagged as a TPB RX.
  
  
 8. When patients or prescriptions are selected or presented in the 
 following options, and the patient is eligible for the TPB benefit, a 
 warning will be given that this patient is eligible for the Transitional 
 Pharmacy Benefit. This warning is given because any new order created 
 through these options for a patient eligible for the TPB benefit will not 
 be flagged as a TPB prescription, since the new option, TPB Rx
 (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY] option was not used:
  
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
 Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT]
 Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
  
  
 9. Anytime a prescription is discontinued, a check will be done on that 
 prescription and patient. If the prescription is a TPB prescription, and 
 the patient is still eligible for the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit, and
 that patient has no more active TPB prescriptions, then the INACTIVATION
 OF BENEFIT DATE field (#2) of the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) will
 automatically be set to the current date, making that patient ineligible
 for the benefit. Also, the INACTIVATION REASON CODE field (#3) of the TPB
 ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) will automatically be set to ALL RX'S INACTIVE.
  
  
 10. Anytime a patient is inactivated in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file 
 (#52.91), a check will be done on the default Rx Patient Status for that 
 patient on the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file 
 (#55), and if that Rx Patient Status is NON-VA, it will be set to null.
  
  
 11. When entering new prescriptions through either the Patient 
 Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option or the Complete
 Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the Rx Patient Status of NON-VA
 will not be selectable, since these orders cannot be flagged as TPB
 prescriptions.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, use the List Tasks [XUTM INQ] option on the
 Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu to list currently running tasks.  
 This patch should be installed when there are no Outpatient Pharmacy
 users on the system, and also when Outpatient Pharmacy orders are not
 being acted upon through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). 
 Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes.
  
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
    Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*146) 
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, 
        DDs, templates, etc.).  
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.  
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*146.
  
 6. When prompted, "Queue the Post-Install to run at what Date@Time:" 
    respond with the appropriate date and time.
  
 7. When prompted, "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? YES//" respond NO.  
  
 8. When prompted, "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//" 
    respond NO.
  
 9. When prompted, "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 10.When prompted,"Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 11. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
