Subject: CAT C'S NOT CONVERTING BACK TO CAT A ON FUT MT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When a new means test is preloaded for a patient, current rules state 
 that if the new means test is to the patient's benefit, the means test 
 becomes effective immediately.  If it's not, it will become effective on 
 the patient's Centralized Anniversary Date (CAD) and the patient's "old" 
 means test will remain effective until that date.  
  
 As reported in the below listed NOIS, when a means test is preloaded at a 
 site, the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) and the CURRENT MEANS TEST 
 STATUS, Field #.14, in the PATIENT File (#2) are updated and the Patient 
 Inquiry [DG PATIENT INQUIRY] will display the "new" means test.  However, 
 when the HEC determines the "new" means test does not benefit the patient 
 and adjusts the CAD, when the adjusted means test is transmitted back to 
 the site, the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) is updated for both the 
 future means test and the previous primary means test (both tests are 
 made NOT PRIMARY).  However, the CURRENT MEANS TEST STATUS Field (#.14), 
 in the PATIENT File (#2), is not updated (it should revert back to the 
 status of the "old" means test).  As a result, the Patient Inquiry [DG 
 PATIENT INQUIRY] will display the incorrect means test from the CURRENT 
 MEANS TEST STATUS Field (#.14) in the PATIENT file, while processing is 
 accomplished using the correct primary means test from the ANNUAL MEANS 
 TEST File (#408.31).  
  
 Functionality
 =============
 This patch modifies the VistA patient lookup to update the CURRENT MEANS 
 TEST STATUS Field (#.14), in the PATIENT File (#2) with the current means 
 test from the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31) if a discrepancy exists 
 between the two fields.  This check occurs whenever a call is made to the 
 DIS^DGMTU procedure to "Display patients current means test status".  This
 will ensure the CURRENT MEANS TEST STATUS Field (#.14) reflects the
 current primary means test.  When this call is made from VistA, the value
 of the entry in the CURRENT MEANS TEST STATUS field (#.14) is compared to
 the primary means test from the ANNUAL MEANS TEST File (#408.31).  If the
 two do not match, $$UPD^DGENDBS is called to update the CURRENT MEANS TEST
 STATUS field (#.14) with the primary means test status.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 Because this patch modifies the patient lookup, it should be loaded when 
 there are few if any users on the system.  This patch should be installed 
 during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users.  Installation will 
 take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  [Note: TEXT 
 PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the patch text 
 only.]
  
 2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the Routine 
 Summary section of this guide are mapped, they should be removed from the 
 mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the 
 Installation menu.  
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when 
 prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*476):
  
     a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a 
        backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It
        will NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b) Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option 
        will allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
        the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
        patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are 
        in the transport global.
  
     d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
        the components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*476.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
 respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8. If routines were unmapped as part of Step 2, they should be returned 
 to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
