Subject: ROLLUP OF DATA TO NATIONAL DATABASE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  
 *******************************NOTE***************************************
 This patch is being distributed as a hostfile, as it contains data
 dictionary additions to the QUALITY ASSURANCE SITE PARAMETER file (#740.)
 The hostfile will be distributed as QAC*2*4, and will include QAQ*1.7*6.
 **************************************************************************
  
 Patch QAC*2*4 collects data from each local site and puts it into a
 mailman message.  This message is sent to the national database for the
 Patient Representative package.  The rollup is done daily.  A post-install
 routine, QACMAIL0, will queue the roll-up and task it for it's first run.
  
 A new field is being added to the CONSUMER CONTACT file (#745.1).  This
 field (#41, Roll-Up Status) will hold a status of "1", 'Rejected' if the
 record has no Issues Code(s), a status of "2", 'Sent - Open' if the record
 has been Rolled Up, but has not been closed, and a status of "0",
 'Cleared' if the record previously had a status of "1" or "2" but is now
 closed and transmitted.  The field is cross-referenced for look-ups.
  
 This patch has an environment check, ENV^QACMAIL1, to make sure the
 domain included in patch XM*DBA*133 has been established. Patch XM*DMA*133
 contains instructions for the creation of the mail domain required for the
 transmission of the Roll-Up messages to the database.  The description
 text for the domain entry describes the database rollup as occurring
 quarterly.  Since the release of the DBA patch, that specification has
 been changed to a daily rollup.  You may want to make that change in your
 domain file, in the Notes field.  Shown here is a screen dump of this
 edit.

 In patch QAQ*1.7*6, which is being distributed with this patch in hostfile
 QAC_2_4.KID two fields are being added to file #740 (QUALITY ASSURANCE
 SITE PARAMETERS file).  The first is field #753 (QAC LAST RECORD) which
 will hold the internal entry number of the last record (from file #745.1 -
 CUSTOMER CONTACT file) sent to the national database.  The second is field
 #754 (QAC ROLLUP TASK which will hold the task number of the currently
 tasked job, if there is one.  It will enable the code to check to see if
 the job is already on the future task list, and prevent multiple copies on
 the task list.
