Subject: CORRECTLY VALIDATE NEW RACE VALUES IN PTF

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch fixes the validation logic PTF uses for race.  The logic
  implemented by patch DG*5.3*415 (RACE AND ETHNICITY, 1997 STANDARDS)
  did not allow a value of UNKNOWN BY PATIENT to be used.  This patch
  modifies the validation logic so that UNKNOWN BY PATIENT is
  recognized as a valid race.
  
  This was reported in the following NOIS IDs:

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  This patch affects the PTF data entry and transmission processes.  This
  patch can be installed with users on the system, however it should be
  installed during off hours to minimize disruption to users.
  
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
  Note: DG*5.3*415 is a REQUIRED build for this KIDS distribution. KIDS
        will not allow the installation of this patch without the prior
        installation of it.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
      patch text only.]
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*493):
  
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*493.
