Description: 
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 This patch initiates changes to the Consult/Request 
 Tracking package to update the REQUEST SERVICES file 
 (123.5) when a user is terminated from the system.  
 In addition, a clean-up process will run to remove already-
 terminated users from the following REQUEST SERVICES file 
 fields:
  
      SPECIAL UPDATES INDIVIDUAL (field #123.5)      
      SERVICE INDIVIDUAL TO NOTIFY (field #123.08)
      UPDATE USERS W/O NOTIFICATIONS (multiple #123.55, field #.01)
      ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USERS (multiple #123.33, field #.01) 
      INDIVIDUAL TO NOTIFY (multiple #123.2, field #1) 
  
 This functionality was requested in the following NOIS 
 and E3R entries:
  
      NOIS               E3R
      --------------     -----
      PUG-0798-52084     6687
      PUG-0298-50734     11509
      BIR-0699-32498     11350
  
 The following steps were taken to ensure the appropriate 
 removal of terminated users from the fields listed above: 
  
 1)  A new option, GMRC TERMINATE CLEANUP is installed and 
     attached to KERNEL's XU USER TERMINATE option.  The 
     GMRC TERMINATE CLEANUP option will not appear on any 
     menus, but will be called automatically when a user is 
     terminated from the system using KERNEL menu options.
  
 2)  A partial Data Dictionary for the REQUEST SERVICES 
     file is included, without data.  Modified fields and 
     additional cross-references are included.  Screens have 
     been added where appropriate to preclude entry of 
     terminated or inactive users in the REQUEST SERVICES 
     file.  
  
 NOTE:  Please ensure that XUAUTODEACTIVATE is scheduled to 
        run nightly at your local site to ensure continued 
        clean-up of terminated or inactive users in the 
        REQUEST SERVICES file.  XUAUTODEACTIVATE will look 
        for entries in the NEW PERSON file that have a 
        termination date up to the current date and will, 
        in turn, call GMRC TERMINATE CLEANUP to ensure all 
        terminated users are removed from consult service 
        setups.

 NOTE: Installation of this patch SHOULD BE TASKED, and 
 scheduled to run at non-peak hours.  Installation time 
 will vary greatly depending on the number of REQUEST 
 SERVICES file entries and the number of users associated 
 with the affected fields.  
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
 2.  On the KIDS menu, under the INSTALLATION menu, select the 
     following options:
  
        Print Transport Global                        optional
        Compare Transport Global to Current System    optional
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global          optional
        Backup a Transport Global                     optional
        Install Package(s)                            REQUIRED
  
 3.  When prompted for INSTALL NAME enter GMRC*3.0*9.

     are no longer needed:
  
         GMRCYP9
         GMRCYP9B
  
 8. If mail is running in the account, the installation 
    process will send a bulletin reminding the installer 
    about the deletion of the post-install routines and 
    noting the number of pointers removed from each file.  
  
 9. Following installation, information on deleted pointers 
    may be found in the INSTALL file (#9.7) with the entry 
    for GMRC*3.0*9.  The KIDS Install menu option Install 
    File Print [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] may be used to 
    view or print this information.
