Subject: PROBLEMS WITH ERROR REPORTS FROM RCCP TRANSMISSIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues. The first issue is a problem which occurs
 when a transmission to Austin is not completed.  A specific error does not
 generate a message to the site sending the transmission when
 they run the Transmit CCPC Messages [RCCPC TRANSMIT] option. The second
 issue is that a T40W transmission error message is created when
 a build file takes over 24 hours to complete.

 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
 1. MAR-0303-20197  CCPC-Failed trans Station 641 VA Maryland HCS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    After transmitting a build file to Austin, the site found that Austin
    didn't receive the transmission and the site didn't receive a message
    to confirm the transmission status after running the Transmit CCPC
    Messages [RCCPC TRANSMIT] option.
   
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCCPCML. An error message will be sent to the 
    RCCPC STATEMENTS mail group when a certain error is encountered in
    the transmit [RCCPC TRANSMIT] option. It will occur if the site has
    no valid data to transmit to Austin.
    
    transmit to Austin.
  
 2. HWH-0403-41518  CCPC transm error each month
  
    Problem:
    --------
    One Site discovered that a T404W is generated if the build file
    takes over 24 hours to complete. They have many files and large
    entries that really need to take more than one day to build the
    CCPC file. The software only allows one day to build
    the file and transmit it. As a result, the site often has to
    manually re-transmit the file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCCPCBJ. The software will reset the transmission 
    for the CCPC build file if it needs more than 24 hours to complete.
    Also, an error message will be sent to the mail group if the build  
    file is not able to complete when the system starts the background job
    for the CCPC transmission.
