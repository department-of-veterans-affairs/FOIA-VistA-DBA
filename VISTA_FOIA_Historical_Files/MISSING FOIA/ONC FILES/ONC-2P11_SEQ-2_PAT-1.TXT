Subject: ROADS UPDATE

Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 The following issues have been addressed, corrected or enhanced by this patch:
  
 1. The required data standards and data sets necessary to bring the DHCP tumor
    registry module into compliance with the Registry Operations And Data
    Standards (ROADS) 1996 specifications approved by the Commission on Cancer
    were implemented.
 
    These modifications include the following changes to the Oncology 
    Primary file (165.5):
  
    -Accession Year (.07) has been expanded to 4 digits. (E3R #7178)
    -The address portion of Patient Identification - II has been broken out 
     as:
     Patient Address at Diagnosis (8)
     City/Town at Diagnosis (8.1)
     State at Diagnosis (16)
     Postal Code at Diagnosis (9)
     County at Diagnosis (10)
     These fields will be stuffed with data from the MAS Patient file (2) but
     will allow for editing.
    -Primary Payor at Diagnosis (18) has been added. (a new field for Oncotrax)
    -Date DX (3) has been moved to be the first prompt in the Cancer
     Identification portion of the abstract.
    -Reporting Hospital (.03) is now a stuffed field importing data from the
     Oncology Site Parameters file.
    -Pointers to institution contacts have been converted to pointers to the
     new ACoS Number file (160.19).  
    -Type of Reporting Source (1.2) has been added. (a new field)
    -Staged By (19) has been added. (a new field)
    -Surgery has been split into two separate fields: Non Cancer-Directed    
     Surgery (58.1) and Cancer-Directed Surgery (58.2).
    -Other Physician 1 has been changed to Managing Physician (2.1).
    -Other Physician 2 has been changed to Following Physician (2.2).
    -Class of Case (.04) code 6 has been added. (a new code)
    -Nodes Positive (32) code 98 has been corrected from None to No Nodes
     Examined.
    -Surgical Approach (74) has been added. (a new field)
    -Reconstructive Surgery (23) has been added. (a new field)
    -Reason for No Radiation/Chemotherapy/Hormone (75/76/77) fields have been
     added. (new fields)
    -All references to "Biological Response Modifier" have been changed to
     "Immunotherapy".
    -New Type of First Recurrence (71) codes have been added.
    -Subsequent Course of Treatment (60) dates will be bypassed if the treatment 
     codes equal 0.
  
 2. The ability to complete the 1995 Patient Care Evaluation Study of Cancers
    of the Urinary Bladder has been added to the abstracting process.  If the
    primary being abstracted meets the criteria for the Bladder PCE, the user
    will be asked if they would like to fill out the survey.
  
 3. Two options have been added to the Utility Options menu:
  
    CT  Create ACoS Data Disk - This option will allow for the creation of a
    diskette to be submitted to the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) in 
    response to the annual Call for Data.  This option searches the Oncology
    Primary file (165.5) and the Oncology Patient file (160) for the necessary
    information.  The user will be prompted for Accession Year and ACoS number.
    This program must be rerun if more than one year is to be searched.
    Information is validated as it is retrieved.
  
    CC Create State Data Disk - This option will allow for the creation of a
    disk to be submitted for state reporting purposes. This option searches the
    Oncology Primary file (165.5) and the Oncology Patient file (160) for the
    necessary information. The user will be prompted for Accession Year, a start
    date and end date for abstract completion and ACoS Number.  The data items
    and record layout follows the American Association of Central Cancer
    Registries (ACCR) Standards: Full Central requirements.
    E3R #4084, E3R #3216
  
 NOIS RESOLUTIONS
  
 4. The sequence number problem reported concerning benign tumors has been
    corrected.
    NOIS MAN-1194-10317   
  
 5. The problem with Soft Palate (C05.1) being assigned to Oral Cavity instead
    of Pharynx at the Site/Gp prompt has been corrected.
    NOIS WAS-0196-21119
  
 6. The N-code prostate for N-2 has been corrected.
    NOIS WAS-0196-21122
  
 7. Two entries have been added to the ICDO Morphology file (164.1):
    Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) 9715/3 and T-cell rich B-cell
    Lymphoma 9688/3.
    NOIS WAS-1295-21814
  
 8. The spelling of the term "carcinomatosis" has been corrected in the 
    Metastasis 1 (34), Metastasis 2 (34.1) and Metastasis 3 (34.2) fields. 
    NOIS SUX-0694-40867

 Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': ONC*.
 
 The installation should take approximately 15 minutes.    
  
 Part of the Post-Install process is a conversion of pointers to the 
 Oncology Contact file (165) to pointers to the new ACoS Number file 
 (160.19).  If pointer conversion exceptions are encountered follow the
 Post-Install instructions to correct the exceptions and re-run the conversion
 by entering D ^ONCOPST1.
