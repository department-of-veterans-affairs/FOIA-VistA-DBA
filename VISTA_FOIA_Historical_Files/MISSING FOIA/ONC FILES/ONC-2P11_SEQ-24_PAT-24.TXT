 DET-0100-41610  Patch #23 ONCPRE23 missing
 
 This patch contains the following items:
   
  1) National Cancer Data Base Annual Call for Data, 1988/1993/1998
     
     The Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) studies of prostate cancer, early
     stage breast cancer and melanoma have been added to the Annual Call
     for Data format version 6.  The prostate and breast formats are for
     the 1998 Annual Call for Data.  The melanoma format will be used for
     the 1999 Annual Call for Data.
   
  2) NOIS LIT-0699-72565 FACILITY DEFAULTS NOT ACCEPTED
   
     If the default values for the following fields exceeded 30 characters
     and were accepted by the user, the application would reject the default
     and return "??".
   
     DX FACILITY                   (165.5,5)
     SURGERY HOSPITAL              (165.5,50.1)
     RADIATION HOSPITAL            (165.5,51.1)
     RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS HOSP (165.5,52.1)
     CHEMOTHERAPY HOSPITAL         (165.5,53.1)
     HORMONE THERAPY HOSPITAL      (165.5,54.1)
     IMMUNOTHERAPY HOSPITAL        (165.5,55.1)
     OTHER TREATMENT HOSPITAL      (165.5,57.1)
   
     The defaults for these fields will now be truncated to 30 characters.
   
     NOTE: We have also removed the "...OK?" prompt when selecting a 
     facility. 
   
  3) NOIS ALN-0799-12615 ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (RAD) OPTION PROB
   
     SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...
       RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search
   
     The Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND 
     (RAD)] option searches the DIAGNOSTIC CODES (78.3) file for codes which 
     contain the string "MALIG" (e.g. POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY, FOLLOW-UP NEEDED).
     Once it had found a code containing "MALIG", the search would stop.  
     Subsequent codes which contained "MALIG" were not found.  This resulted
     in an incomplete casefinding search.
   
     The Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search has been modified to search
     for all DIAGNOSTIC CODES which contain the string "MALIG".
   
  4) NOIS ALB-0899-50820 Error while re-indexing file 160
   
     Oncology Site Manager Menu
       RI Reindex Data Files (160,165.5,165)
   
     While re-indexing the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (160) file, an "undefined 
     variable D0" error would occur.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  5) NEW FACILITY (160.19) FILE ENTRY
   
     The following entry has been added to the FACILITY file:
   
     361345 SALISBURY VA MEDICAL CENTER  SALISBURY, NC
   
  6) ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       BA Print Abstract-Brief (80c)
   
     The user prompt for the above option was:
   
       Select ONCOLOGY PRIMARY SITE/GP:
   
     At the users' request this prompt has been changed to:
   
       Select ONCOLOGY PATIENT NAME:
   
  7) MULTIPLE MYELOMA
    
     The ICDO MORPHOLOGY (164.1) code 9730/3 has been discontinued.  The
     correct code for MULTIPLE MYELOMA is 9732/3.  All 9730/3 values have
     been converted to 9732/3.
   
  8) TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE (165.5,1.2)
   
     Code 1 contained a spelling error ("Hosptial").
   
     This has been fixed.
   
  9) TUMOR MARKER 3       (165.5,25.3)
     PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION (165.5,30.1) 
   
     TUMOR MARKER 3 pertains only to testicular cancer (C62.0, C62.1,
     C62.9).  All non-testicular cases will now be stuffed with a TUMOR
     MARKER 3 value of 9 (Unknown or no information).
   
     PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION pertains only to prostate (C61.9) cases.  All
     non-prostate cases will now be stuffed with a PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION
     value of 99 (Unknown).
   
 10) UTL *..Utility Options ...

        The above data items were not being extracted correctly.  They have
        been fixed.
   
     b) Version 5.1 of the VAACCR record layout has been updated to version
        6.0.
   
     c) Data item "Linkage Name Sum" (1524-1525) has been removed from the
        version 6.0 Annual Call for Data, State Reporting and VACCR layouts.
        It remains only in the version 5.1 State Reporting layout.
   
 11) AUTOPSY (160,22.9)
     AUTOPSY (165.5,83)
   
     There were two AUTOPSY fields, one in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file (160)
     and one in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (165.5).  Logically, AUTOPSY
     should only reside in the ONCOLOGY PATIENT file.
   
     Also, the codes associated with AUTOPSY (160,22.9) were not ROADS
     compliant.  The codes associated with AUTOPSY (165.5,83) are the
     correct ROADS codes (0,1,2,9).
   
     To resolve this problem we have done the following:
   
     a) The ONCOLOGY PRIMARY AUTOPSY field (165.5,83) has been deleted and
        all references to it have been changed to AUTOPSY (160,22.9).  
     b) The AUTOPSY (160,22.9) codes have been modified to be ROADS 
        compliant.
   
 12) NOIS PUG-0999-52556 CAN NOT READ HEADINGS IN CROSS-TAB REPORT
   
     STA *..Statistical Reports ...
       CI Cross Tabs (ICDO-Site) - Total Registry
         12 TREATMENT
   
     The TREATMENT column headings on the TREATMENT Cross Tabs report were
     truncating to a length of 8.  This was causing ambiguous column 
     headings for primaries with more than 4 treatments.
   
     Instead of using TREATMENT (165.5,43) as the source of treatment data,
     this option now uses TX SEQ (165.5,42) which has been renamed TREATMENT
     PLAN.  This field uses shorter treatment abbreviations which allow for
     more unique column headings.
   
 13) INSTITUTION ID NUMBER (160.1,27)
     REPORTING HOSPITAL    (165.5,.03)
   
     The DATA TYPE for these fields was FREE TEXT.  This permitted the
     entry of any 6-digit number regardless of its validity.
   
     The DATA TYPE for these fields has been changed to POINTER TO A FILE.
     They are now pointers to the FACILITY (160.19) file.  The FREE TEXT
     data values have been converted to pointer values. 
   
 14) NOIS LIT-1099-70033 JUMP+7^ONCMPC5, LINER, Undefined line label
     NOIS LIT-1199-72698 JUMP+7^ONCMPC5, Undefined line label  
 
     When the user tried to "jump" directly to items 78 (TYPE OF FIRST
     RECURRENCE) or 79 (OTHER TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE), an "Undefined
     line label" error would occur.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
 15) PS Patient Index-Site (80c)
     PE Patient Index-EOVA (132c)
   
     The above options were incorrectly displaying all ONCOLOGY PATIENT
     (160) records.  They should only display ONCOLOGY PATIENT records
     which have primaries associated with them.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
 16) NOIS BHH-1199-41841 Unable to access ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU
     NOIS MOU-1299-31596  Follow-up problem  
 
     FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...
       PF Post/Edit Follow-up
       RF Recurrence/Sub Tx Follow-up
   
     Due to a FileMan change the above options were not allowing the user
     to successfully select a patient for follow-up or recurrence.
   
     This has been fixed.
   
 17) NOIS DET-0100-41610 Patch #23 ONCPRE23 missing
 
     The default ACCESSION NO. (165.5,.05) value for year 2000 cases
     was being computed incorrectly.
 
     This has been fixed.
