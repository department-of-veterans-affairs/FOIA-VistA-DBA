  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charges (CMAC) charges were redesigned 
 beginning with 2005 charges.  This redesign included categorizing the CMAC 
 charges into Facility and Non-Facility charges.  This patch is an update 
 to allow the sites access to the 'Non-Facility' CMAC charges.
                         
 The patch IB*2*307 CMAC 2005 was released July 2005 to allow the new CMAC 
 charge structure to be uploaded into the Charge Master.  At that time, it 
 was understood that all VA sites met the criteria of a CMAC 'Facility'. 
 Therefore, IB*2*307 only allowed the CMAC 'Facility' charges to be loaded 
 into the Charge Master.
                         
 However, it has since been determined that many VA Community Based 
 Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) sites fit the criteria of the CMAC 
 'Non-Facility' category.  Therefore, this patch is being released as 
 an update to the original CMAC 2005 patch to allow the sites the 
 ability to load the 'Non-Facility' CMAC charges.
                         
 With the installation of this patch and the load of the CMAC charges, all 
 CMAC 2005 charges will be available for use on a bill.  The 
 'Facility/Physician' charges will be the default category used for all 
 bills.  Therefore, if the 'Non-Facility' or 'Non-Physician' charges are 
 needed, they must be manually selected (Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB 
 EDIT BILLING INFO], screen 6/7, option 6)
                         
 Special Note:  Implementation of CMAC 2005 is a two step process.  The 
 first step is installation of this patch, which is mandatory.  The second 
 step is uploading CMAC charges and is optional, depending on if your site 
 uses the CMAC.  
                         
 Patch IB*2*307 allowed the loading of the Category 1, Facility/Physician 
 and Category 3, Facility/Non-Physician CMAC charges.  Patch IB*2*329 will 
 allow the loading of all CMAC charges, including the Category 2, Non-
 Facility/Physician and Category 4, Non-Facility/Non-Physician CMAC 
 charges.
                     
                     
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 General Description of CMAC 2005 now available at sites:
                              
 The CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charges (CMAC) charges were redesigned 
 in 2005 to define 4 Categories of charges:
                              
 Category 1, Facility/Physician: Services of MDs, DOs, optometrists, 
 podiatrists, psychologists, oral surgeons, occupational therapists, speech 
 therapists, physical therapists, and audiologists provided in a facility 
 setting.
                              
 Category 2, Non-Facility/Physician: Services of MDs, DOs, optometrists, 
 podiatrists, psychologists, oral surgeons, occupational therapists, speech 
 therapists, physical therapists, and audiologists provided in a non-
 facility setting, including provider offices, home settings.
                              
 Category 3, Facility/Non-Physician: Services of all other providers not 
 found in category 1, provided in a facility setting
                              
 Category 4, Non-Facility/Non-Physician: Services of all other providers 
 not found in category 2, provided in a non-facility setting.
                                        
 Four Charge Sets will be created in the Charge Master corresponding to the 
 four CMAC categories and will be set up as Professional charges:
 -  CMAC xxx FAC/PHYS charges correspond to category 1.  Default.
 -  CMAC xxx FAC/NONPHYS charges correspond to category 3
 -  CMAC xxx NONFAC/PHYS charges correspond to category 2
 -  CMAC xxx NONFAC/NONPHYS charges correspond to category 4
                              
 Category 1, Facility/Physician charges will always be the default charges 
 on a bill.  Therefore, if any of the other 3 categories need to be applied 
 to a bill, they must be manually selected on screen 6/7, option 6 of 
 Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
                              
 Designation of VA CBOC's:
 -  Non-Facility:  When care is provided in a VA Community Based Outpatient 
    Clinic (CBOC) using Place of Service (POS) 11 you should use the Non-
    facility CMAC rates under categories 2 & 4.  The CBOC's with POS 11 
    should not bill a separate facility charge when using Non-facility 
    rates under categories 2 & 4.
                   
 -  Facility:  VA Institutions that qualify as Facility sites of services 
    when billing TRICARE should be downloading CMAC charges under 
    categories 1 (physicians) and 3 (non physicians) when services are 
    being billed.
                        
 The effective date of the CMAC 2005 charges is 04/01/05.
                              
 Beginning with the CMAC 2005, the upload of the charges will automatically 
 create the correct Charge Sets, ask for the associated divisions, and 
 assign those charge sets to the Rate Schedules that already have any CMAC 
 charges assigned.

 5.   UPLOAD CMAC 2005 Charges for Non-Facility charges
      -------------------------------------------------
      Follow the instructions below, if needed.
                                       
                                       
 ****************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *******************
                                                         
 Upload of the CMAC charges is required only if your site uses the CMAC.  
 Two subsections for loading of the charges have been provided: one section 
 for loading only the 'Non-Facility' charges and a general section for  
 loading all CMAC charges.
                                       
 A.  Determine if CMAC charges are needed at your sites.
     Only continue if your site does use CMAC.
                                       
 B.  If your site already loaded the CMAC 2005 after the release of 
     IB*2*307 and only needs to upload the CMAC 2005 'Non-Facility' 
     charges, then follow the 'NON-FACILITY CMAC 2005 INSTALLATION 
     INSTRUCTIONS'.
                                       
     If there exists within the Charge Master a Charge Set 'CMAC xxx 
     FAC/PHYS', then there are CMAC 2005 charges for locality xxx.
                                       
 C.  If you need to install a new complete set of CMAC 2005 charges, then 
     follow the 'CMAC 2005 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS'.
                                       
                                       
 ========== NON-FACILITY CMAC 2005 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==========
                               
 Complete the following steps to load the CMAC 2005 'Non-Facility' charges 
 for localities that already have the CMAC 2005 'Facility' charges loaded.
                                                                     
 Set-Up Steps
 ------------
                                       
 1.  Compile the list of localities CMAC charges are needed for.
     As this is basically a re-load to get additional charges for existing 
     sets, you may determine which localities are needed by searching for 
     sets already in the Charge Master.
                                       
     In the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER] option,  
     action CS - Charge Set, then action RG - Billing Region.  Find all 
     Billing Regions 'CMAC xxx'.  Note the xxx 3 digit CMAC locality number 
     and identify the zip code of that locality by the associated 
     Divisions.
                                       
     This 3 digit locality number and zip code will be needed to identify 
     the proper charges to obtain.
                                 
 2.  Obtain the sets of CMAC charge files required, in ASCII.  
     It is possible the files used initially to load the CMAC 2005 are 
     still available locally on your system, '2005CMACxxx.TXT'.  If these 
     are available, they may be used, otherwise complete the following:
                                         
     The CMAC files are available at:  http://vaww.cf.webdev.va.gov/vadod
                                         
     Select CMAC Rates, then CMAC Rates.  Enter the zip code of a primary 
     site that requires CMAC charges.  A file of CMAC charges will be 
     created for the Locality which contains the entered zip code.  Right 
     click on the 3-digit code in the Locality Code column and save the 
     file to your local system.  This 3-digit code is the Locality the 
     charges apply to.
                                         
     Be sure the 3-digit code locality is one already loaded on your site, 
     from the list obtained in step 1.
                                         
     Complete the process for each division zip charges are needed for.
                                  
     The CMAC files created will be named:  2005CMACxxx.TXT w/xxx is 
     locality.
                                       
 3.  If new files were obtained in step 2, then move these CMAC files to a 
     directory accessible to VISTA.  Use ASCII format.
                                          
                                       
 Load CMAC 'Non-Facility' Charges into VISTA:
 --------------------------------------------
                                       
 4.  Enter Charge Master IRM Menu [IBCR CHARGE MASTER IRM MENU] option, 
     then Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option.
                                         
 5.  Select 1.1  Load CMAC into XTMP.
                                         
     If there are any CMAC files already loaded, then they will be listed.
     Delete them and continue.
                                 
 6.  Enter the correct Path where the CMAC files were placed in 3.
                                         
 7.  All available CMAC files will be displayed.  Enter the file to load.
     Be sure this is one of the localities identified in step 1.
                                         
 8.  If component charges are desired, then enter the appropriate Modifier.
                                         
     Professional Component Modifier: // 26
     Technical Component Modifier: // TC
                                         
 9.  Calculate and Compile CMAC charges into Charge Master form.
                                         
     Enter Yes to 'Proceed with upload now'
     The required Charge Master elements will be automatically created.
                                       
     Note the following example illustrates that this locality had 
     previously been loaded for the 'Facility' charges and the previously 
     existing Charge Set is used.  But the 'Non-Facility' charges are 
     new, since it adds new Charge Sets.
                                       
       Proceed with upload now? YES
          >> CMAC 348 FAC/PHYS Charge Set used                 <<<
          >> CMAC 348 FAC/NONPHYS Charge Set used              <<<

 10. Delete 'Facility' Charges
     Because the 'Facility' sets of charges are already loaded they must be 
     deleted before loading into the Charge Master to ensure no duplicate 
     charges are created.
                                       
     Select 5 Delete XTMP files, then delete the 'FAC' Subfiles: 1-6.
                                       
     The result is the set of 'Non-Facility' only charges to be loaded:

 11. Check Data Validity of charges created
     Select 3 Check Data Validity and print the result.  It is expected 
     that there will be 14 Wxxxx procedure charges that can not be 
     found.  This is ok.
                                       
 12. Load charges into the Charge Master
     Select 4 Load into Charge Master.  Select a device to print the 
     result.  The results should be a clean load except for one duplicate
     and the 14 Wxxxx procedures which can not be loaded.  This is ok.
                                         
 13. Repeat Steps 5-12 for each CMAC Locality file needed, after the load 
     is completed and the results report is printed.

 ========================================================================
                                  
 ================== CMAC 2005 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
                                       
 Complete the following steps to load the CMAC 2005 charges for any 
 locality.  Upload of the CMAC charges is required only if your site uses 
 the CMAC.
                                                                   
 Set-Up Steps:
 -------------
                                         
 1.  Determine if CMAC charges are needed at your site.  
     Only continue if your site does use CMAC.
                                         
 2.  Compile the list of Divisions CMAC charges are needed for.  
     This list should include both the Division number and the zip code of 
     the location of the division.
                                         
 3.  Obtain the sets of CMAC charge files required, in ASCII.  
                                         
     These files are available at:  http://vaww.cf.webdev.va.gov/vadod
                                         
     Select CMAC Rates, then CMAC Rates.  Enter the zip code of a primary 
     site that requires CMAC charges.  A file of CMAC charges will be 
     created for the Locality which contains the entered zip code.  Right 
     click on the 3-digit code in the Locality Code column and save the 
     file to your local system.  This 3-digit code is the Locality the 
     charges apply to.
                                         
     The CMAC charges are based on a Locality code.  Many zip codes are 
     contained within each Locality.  Therefore, it is likely that one set 
     of CMAC charges will be applicable to several divisions.  
                                         
     Complete the process for each division zip code charges are needed 
     for.  If the same file, as identified by the 3-digit code, is created 
     for multiple division zip codes, then only one is needed, but make 
     note of all the divisions that are contained within that locality.
                                         
     The CMAC files created will be named:  2005CMACxxx.TXT w/xxx is 
     locality.
                                         
 4.  Move the CMAC files to a directory accessible to VISTA.  Use ASCII.
                                         
                                            
 CMAC Upload into VISTA:  
 -----------------------
                                         
 5.  Enter Charge Master IRM Menu [IBCR CHARGE MASTER IRM MENU] option, 
     then Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option.
                                         
 6.  Select 1.1  Load CMAC into XTMP.
                                         
     If there are any CMAC files already loaded, then they will be listed.
     Delete them and continue.
                                 
 7.  Enter the correct Path where the CMAC files were placed in 4.
                                         
 8.  All available CMAC files will be displayed.  Enter the file to load.
                                         
     Note:  CMAC 2005 files name format:  '2005CMACxxx.TXT'
            CMAC files pre-2005 format:   'CMACxxx.TXT'
                                         
 9.  If component charges are desired, then enter the appropriate Modifier.
                                         
     Professional Component Modifier: // 26
     Technical Component Modifier: // TC
                                         
 10. Calculate and Compile CMAC charges into Charge Master form.
                                         
     Enter Yes to 'Proceed with upload now'
     The required Charge Master elements will be automatically created:
     -  Billing Region (there will be a warning about no division)
     -  Charge Sets (4) will be created if not already defined.
        >> CMAC xxx FAC/PHYS
        >> CMAC xxx FAC/NONPHYS
        >> CMAC xxx NONFAC/PHYS
        >> CMAC xxx NONFAC/NONPHYS
     -  The Charge Sets will be added to Rate Schedules that already have 
        other CMAC charges assigned.  
        >> If there are no Rate Schedules with CMAC assigned then these 
           will have to be added manually. (see step 14)
     -  Division will be asked.  Enter all Divisions whose zip codes are 
        covered by the Locality, as determined in step 3.
        >> These charges will only be applied to the divisions added.  
           Therefore, if no division or not all needed divisions are added 
           here then they must be added after the upload.  (see step 15)
                                         
     The end result of this step is a set of temporary VISTA files 
     containing the CMAC charges in a form appropriate for loading into the 
     Charge Master.
                                         
 11. Check Data Validity of charges created
     Select 3 Check Data Validity and print the result.  It is expected 
     that there will be one duplicate charge and 14 Wxxxx procedure charges 
     that can not be found.  This is ok.
                                         
 12. Load charges into the Charge Master
     Select 4 Load into Charge Master.  Select a device to print the 
     result.  The results should be a clean load except for one duplicate
     and the 14 Wxxxx procedures which can not be loaded.
                                         
 13. Repeat Steps 6-12 for each CMAC Locality file needed, after the load 
     is completed and the results report is printed.
                                                              
 14. Add new Charge Sets to Rate Schedules, if necessary.
     When the charges are set up in step 10, it will add the new Charge 
     Sets to any Rate Schedule that already has CMAC charges assigned.  If 
     none were found, then the following message is displayed and the links 
     must be manually set.
      *** Warning: CMAC 359 FAC/PHYS not added to any Rate Schedule,
          set manually using Enter/Edit Charge Master option.
     Add the new Charge Sets to Rate Schedules for the Billing Rates that 
     should be billed using CMAC:
     Use the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER] option
     Select Action RS - Rate Schedule, then add the new Charge Sets to the 
     appropriate Rate Schedule.  The 'FAC/PHYS' Set should be AUTO = Yes.
     All others should be AUTO = BLANK.
                                       
 15. Add Divisions to new Billing Regions, if necessary.
     When the charges are set up in step 10, it will add the new Billing 
     Region that defines the divisions that may use the charges.  If no 
     division or not all necessary divisions were added, then they need to 
     be assigned after the upload.  Any division not assigned to a CMAC 
     Billing Region will not be able to use the CMAC charges.
                                       
     Add all divisions covered by a CMAC locality to the corresponding 
     Billing Region:
     Use the Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER] option
     Select Action CS - Charge Set, then Select Action RG - Billing 
     Regions then add the Divisions to the appropriate CMAC Billing Region.
                                       
 16. Optional:  Add Revenue Code - CPT links for CMAC.
     The CMAC charges may be set up so the charges for specific procedures 
     are associated with specific revenue codes.  To do this use the 
     Revenue Code - CPT links functionality.  There are two options:
                                       
     a.  Use the Standard Revenue Code Links already defined.
                                       
     If the Revenue Code CPT links already defined will work for the CMAC, 
     then assign the CMAC to the current set.
                                       
     In the Charge Master Main Menu, use the Print Option V-Rev Cd Links to 
     print out the existing links to determine if these will work for the 
     CMAC.
                                       
     If the existing links are ok, then assign the CMAC to the existing 
     special group:  in the Enter/Edit Charge Master, SG - Special Groups, 
     ED - Edit Special Groups:
                                       
           Select Action: Quit// ED   Edit Special Groups  
                                       
           Enter/Edit a Special Group: 
                                       
           Select BILLING SPECIAL GROUPS NAME: STANDARD RVCD LINKS
             REVENUE CODE LINK
                                       
           This was exported Nationally, only the assigned Billing Rates 
           may be edited.
           This group has associated Revenue Code Links.  Type can not be
