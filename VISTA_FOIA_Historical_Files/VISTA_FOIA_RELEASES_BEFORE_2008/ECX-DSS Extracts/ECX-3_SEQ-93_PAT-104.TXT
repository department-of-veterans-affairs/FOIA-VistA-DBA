 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000172247:        Nutrition Division Worksheet Delivery Locations 
                         doesn't show when the IEN of the Service Point
                         is greater than 1 digit
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The user entered the delivery location information in option 1 Enter/Edit 
 Nutrition Division Worksheet, but the print report doesn't seem to recognize 
 it.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECXNUTDP was modified so that delivery location information is 
 printed on the Delivery Location Report.
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000161052:        Pharmacy Unusual Volumes Report in DSS doesn't
                         show all the fills of the same drug
  
 Problem:
 --------
 PHARMACY UNUSUAL VOLUMES REPORT -- Is there someone who can help me with
 the pharmacy unusual volume report? 554 has a patient that received 6
 fills in August of the same drug and the same qty but only one fill shows
 on the report.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines ECXAPHA2 AND ECXAPHA were modified to allow the same drug and the 
 same quantity on a given date to be printed on PHARMACY UNUSUAL VOLUMES 
 REPORT. 
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000170503:        The Lab blood bank extract was not providing the 
                         appropriate division for blood bank products
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Lab blood bank extract was not providing the appropriate division for 
 blood bank products. We are a multidivisional site. Our DSS manager
 reported that the extract has a blank space for division for Brooklyn
 patients and the NY patients are populated with 630. Also a request was
 made by the Decision Support Office (DSO) to change the FEEDER LOCATION
 (#17) field to have the letters "BB" concatenated with the PRODUCTION
 DIVISION CODE (#27) field in the BLOOD BANK EXTRACT (#727.829) file.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ECXLBB was modified to correct the PRODUCTION DIVISION CODE (#27)
 field in the BLOOD BANK EXTRACT (#727.829) file and to change the FEEDER
 LOCATION (#17) field to have the letters "BB" concatenated with the
 PRODUCTION DIVISION CODE (#27) field in the BLOOD BANK EXTRACT (#727.829)
 field.
