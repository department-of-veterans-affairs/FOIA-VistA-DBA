Subject: ACRP Performance Monitor Report

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently, the Ambcare Performance Monitor Report excludes all appointment
 types other than 'Regular'.  A new appointment type, 'Service Connected',
 was recently created and added to the Appointment Type file (409.1) with
 patch SD*5.3*394.  Encounters with this new appointment type need to be
 included on this report so, the report will be modified to exclude all
 appointment types except for 'Regular' and 'Service Connected'.
 This patch will also correct a formatting problem with the Encounters 
 Transmitted with MT Status of U Report.  And finally, this patch will
 correct an existing problem with the Ambcare Ad Hoc report.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD146834 - Performance Monitor Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The existing software for the ACRP Performance Monitor Report excludes
     encounters with any appointment type other than 'Regular'.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDPMUT2 will be modified so that encounters with an
     appointment type of 'Service Connected' will also now be included on
     the ACRP Performance Monitor Report.
  
  
 2)  HD114781 - Encounters Transmitted with MT Status of U Report - output
                error
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When printing the Encounters Transmitted with MT Status of U Report,
     if a patient has multiple encounters and a page feed occurs, the
     patient's next encounter data starts printing on the following page
     concatenated to the last line of the Header information.  Also, the
     patient's name does not reprint on the following page, making the
     report difficult to read.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SCRPW81 will be modified so that when a patient has multiple
     encounters and a page feed takes place, a proper line feed will occur,
     the patient's name will be reprinted (for readability), followed by
     the next encounter data.
  
  
 3)  HD124002 - ACRP Adhoc Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user runs the ACRP Ad Hoc report, selects a report perspective
     of Outpatient Encounter and an Outpatient Encounter category of
     Status, if they enter a question mark at the prompt - Select
     APPOINTMENT STATUS NAME - they are presented with a list of all status
     types contained in the Appointment Status file (409.63).
     Currently, four cancellation types which cannot be used with this
     report are included in the selection list. 
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SCRPW23 will be modified, so that when applicable, an
     additional variable will be defined - DIC("S") - so that when
     Fileman API ^DIC is called, it will screen out the four different
     cancellation types which cannot be selected.
