  - Routine

Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*20 is a required build for patch RG*1*30.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
  or subscribers.
   
  1.) The Link & Process Status Display [RG LINKS & PROCESS DISPLAY]
  option is used to monitor the status of MPI/PD related functions and
  messaging.  The data can also be generated from the Master Patient
  Index (MPI), via a remote procedure call, for use by the MPI Data
  Quality Management team.  Refinements have been made to provide more
  data for the remote procedure call.  Specifically the following
  detailed information will be returned:
   - any Logical Links used for MPI/PD messaging that don't have an
     INSTITUTION defined.
   - any Logical Links used for MPI/PD messaging that have an incorrect
     INSTITUTION defined.
   - any Non-MPI/PD Links that have an INSTITUTION definition of the
     local site.
   
  The routines involved in this functionality are RGMTMONT, RGMTMONX,
  and RGMTETOT.
     
  2.) NOIS MAC-0403-60317 requested a refinement to the Patient Audit
  File Print [RGMT AUDIT PRINT] option.  The option allows you to enter
  more than one patient.  If you enter only one name and there was no
  audit data in the selected date range you are told this on the printout.
  If you enter multiple names it only prints those that had an audit in
  the selected date range.  The other names are not displayed on the
  report (i.e. there is no message indicating there was no audit data.)
  Code was changed in routine RGMTAUDP to display a message for each
  patient selected for whom no audit data is available.
   
  3.) NOIS UNY-0303-10304 reported a problem when using the Edit
  Patient Data functionality within the ListManager portion of the MPI/PD
  Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option for a patient marked
  sensitive.  This problem was corrected in routine RGEX03.
     
  4.) NOISes ROS-0403-50584 and PRE-0403-60535 reported a problem with
  the Patient Audit action within the Patient Data Review [VAFC EXCEPTION
  HANDLER] option.  After the installation of patch RG*1*20, Patient Audit
  only prompts for date range without displaying audit data.  This problem
  was corrected in routine RGMTAUD.
