Subject: CHANGES FOR END OF MONTH ACCOUNTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Department of the Treasury has directed all federal agencies to 
 accelerate SF 224 (Statement of Transactions), and other external
 reporting at the End of the Accounting Month (EOAM). To comply with these
 external reporting changes, VA's Financial Management System (FMS) EOAM
 processing cycle will be changed so that the workday overlap will be
 eliminated. This requires changes in the schedules for producing
 interfacing files that are needed in FMS at the end of the month to
 provide for accurate and timely EOAM financial reporting.  Beginning with
 September 2003, EOAM will be processed on the last workday of the calendar
 month, and all interfacing EOAM files must be received at the Austin
 Automation Center (AAC) by 8 PM (CT) on the last workday of the month.
  
 To accomplish this, it has been determined that VA medical facilities will
 have to cut off their monthly processing 3 workdays from the end of the
 month. This will allow them the time they need to generate data and 
 reports, as well as reconcile the data, in order to meet the submission 
 deadline. This cutoff only affects the VistA Accounts Receivable (AR) 
 application package. Any AR processing that occurs after the cutoff date 
 will be held up within VistA and not sent to the AAC until the first day 
 of the following month. This is necessary to allow medical centers to 
 close their monthly processes. The accounting month in AR will now 
 encompass the last three workdays of the previous month, and up to the
 last three workdays of the current month.
  
  
 This enhancement will modify Accounts Receivable as follows:
  
 1. A cutoff date will be imposed.  The cutoff date is midnight before the
    third workday from the end of a month.  For example, for the month of
    June 2003, the cutoff would be midnight on June 25.  This would leave
    three workdays - June 26, 27, and 28 - before the end of the month.
  
 2. A tool will be created that will calculate the cutoff date.
  
    Routine RCRJR has been modified to include the utility to figure out
    the cutoff date for the current month.  The utility is $$LDATE^RCRJR.
  
 3. The Accounts Receivable Data Collector (ARDC) process will be modified
    so that it runs on the morning after the cutoff date.
  
    Routine ^RCRJRCO has been modified to accommodate this change.
  
 4. The ARDC will collect the last three workdays of data from the previous
    month through the cutoff date in the current month.
  
    Routine RCRJRCO has been modified to accommodate this change.
  
    Other routines that have been modified to accommodate changes to the
    ARDC and reports generated by the ARDC are as follows:
  
     RCRJRCO2
     RCRJRCOL
     RCRJRCOR
     RCXFMSSV
     RCXFMSTX
     RCXFMSWR
  
 5. The OIG Extract will run on the same schedule as the ARDC, and will
    encompass the same data collection period.
  
    Routine RCRJRCO has been modified to accommodate this change.
  
 6. The Bad Debt Report process will run on the same schedule as the ARDC, 
    and will encompass the same data collection period.
  
    Routine RCRJRBDR and RCRJRBDT and RCRJRCO have been modified 
    to accommodate the changes to the Bad Debt report.
  
 7. The Bad Debt Report Accrual Over-Ride process will encompass the same 
    data collection period as the ARDC.  The users may over-ride the Bad
    Debt Report from the day after the EOAM to, and not including, the
    second to last work day of the calendar month.
  
    Routine RCRJRBDE has been modifies to accommodate the changes to the
    Bad Debt Accrual Over-Ride.
