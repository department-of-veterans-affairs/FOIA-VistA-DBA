Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are generating extracts for FY1999 data.
   
   ****************************************************************
    
   This patch corrects a problem when attempting to generate or
   purge the Prosthetics (PRO) extract as reported in NOIS issue
   CTX-0199-71796.  The problem is caused by a missing or incomplete
   record for Prosthetics in the EXTRACT DEFINITIONS file (#727.1).
   
   It was found that a number of sites have a degraded file #727.1
   that prevented proper file update to occur in patch ECX*3*8. The
   file degradation appears to have been caused by incorrect use of
   the Define Extract Schedule [ECXDEFINE] option, which added
   erroneous stub entries to file #727.1.
   
   File #727.1 has become increasingly important in DSS EXTRACTS v3
   and it is therefore important that it be correct and consistent
   at all sites.  This patch will repair the file, and place a high 
   level of FileMan security on it for future protection.
   
   Additionally, option ECXDEFINE is being place out-of-service
   until time permits further revision.  Sites should use the
   appropriate option on the Package Extracts [ECXMENU] menu to
   setup and queue extract generation.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
    
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
     
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
     
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*18):
    
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
          transport global.  
     
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*18.
    
   6.  If you do not intend to queue the installation to run after normal
       business hours, then answer "NO" to the following prompt:
   
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
   
       If you answer "YES", then the installation will require much more 
       than 2 minutes to run due to the menu rebuild process. 
   
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
       Extract Manager's Options      [ECXMGR]
    
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
   9.  After this patch has been successfully installed, please delete
       routine ECX318PR.
