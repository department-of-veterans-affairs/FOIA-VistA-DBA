    i. Potential Cost Recovery Rpt (Outpatient, Pharm, CH/CNH, Ancillary)
         Potential Cost Recovery Report [FB PCR]
  
 2. Add new report to list unauthorized EDI claims that were disapproved.
  
    This patch creates a new report to the unauthorized claims module. The
    new report lists unauthorized claims that are an EDI claim from the 
    FPPS system and have been dispositioned within the specified period as
    Disapproved, Cancelled/Withdrawn, or Abandoned. 
  
    The new option is Disapproved EDI Claim Report [FBUC DISAPPROVED EDI].
    It is attached to the Outputs for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC OUTPUTS]
    menu.
  
    Here is a sample screenshot of the resulting output:
  
    Select Outputs for Unauthorized Claims Option: Disapproved EDI Claim

       Beginning Date:  Jan 01, 2004// 1/1/03  (JAN 01, 2003)

 3. Update VA fee schedule compilation to consider units for claims with a
    date of service in FY 2004.
    
    When the VA Fee Schedule (75th Percentile) is compiled with a
    Beginning Date in fiscal year 2004 or later, the software will divide
    the amount claimed by the number of units and use the result (amount
    claimed per unit) to determine the 75th percentile amount that is
    stored in the FEE BASIS FEE SCHEDULE file for that year. Payments are
    selected based on the date of service and only invoices with a date of
    service in fiscal year 2004 or later will have been entered into the
    computer after it has been updated to ask for units.
  
    The following option is modified:
      Compile Fee Schedule [FBAA CALCULATE SCHEDULE]
  
 4. Modify Selection Capability for Suspension Letters Module.
  
    This patch adds new sort/selection options for Suspense Letters. 
    Below is the new added prompt and the associated help text:   
  
    Only print letters for claims that were submitted via 
    (EDI/NON-EDI/ALL):ALL// ?
  
    Enter EDI to just print suspension letters for EDI claims from the FPPS
    system.
    Enter NON-EDI to just print suspension letters for claims that are not
    EDI.
    Enter ALL to print suspension letters for both EDI and NON-EDI claims.
  
  
      Select one of the following:
  
           1         EDI
           2         NON-EDI
           3         ALL
  
    Only print letters for claims that were submitted via 
    (EDI/NON-EDI/ALL):ALL//
  
    The following options are modified:
      Suspension Letter Print [FBAA SUSPENSION LETTER PRINT]
      Individual Suspension Letter Print [FBAA SUSPENSION LETTER INDIV]
