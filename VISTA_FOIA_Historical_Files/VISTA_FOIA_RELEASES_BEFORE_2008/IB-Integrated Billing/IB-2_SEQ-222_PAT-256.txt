Subject: IB INSURANCE API

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch is to standardize existing VistA Integrated Billing calls.
 All direct IB touch points will be replaced with standard API's
 available to all VistA packages. This patch is introducing a new API
 call INSUR^IBBAPI that returns Insurance information.
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
  
 This INTEGRATED BILLING patch provides an API to allow for seamless
 transition from the current IB system to a different authoritative
 source for insurance information.  Insurance Information is returned
 inside an array to be used by the calling package where applicable. 
 Values sent include the Patient's DFN, the Insurance Active Date,
 Status filters, the array to retain the returned data, and a list of
 fields to return.
  
 DOCUMENTATION
 ================
  
 The following documentation is available and includes information for
 this Integrated Billing API.
