 NSR: Backup Reviewer for Unprocessed Alerts NSR 20070201
 E3R: 19699
  
  
 Issue:
 Backup reviewer report needed. This report was reviewed by the OI Patient 
 Safety Work Group PSI-06-024 The parameter XQAL BACKUP REVIEWER (Backup 
 Reviewer for Unprocessed Alerts) is used to define the individual who 
 will be forwarded unprocessed alerts for the specified entity that remain 
 unprocessed by the original recipients. If a provider is identified as a 
 backup reviewer and leaves the VA (for example) there is a risk that 
 those alerts may never get processed or there will be a delay in 
 processing the alerts.  It is true that if there is no identifiable 
 BACKUP REVIEWER entry, alerts will be sent to members of the "XQAL 
 UNPROCESSED ALERTS" mail group, however it is not a timely solution to 
 the problem and the reporting site is requesting a pro-active solution be 
 implemented.  
  
 What is being requested is a report be developed to list the ORES and 
 ORELSE key holders who do NOT have a backup reviewer identified, so as to 
 take actions to identify a backup reviewer for these individuals and 
 prevent future problems.
  
 Fix: 
 Created an option XQAL NO BACKUP REVIEWER to run a report that generates 
 a list of active users/providers that hold the ORES key and backup 
 reviewers for ALERTS.
  
  
  
 Option Name: No Alert Backup Reviewer[XQAL NO BACKUP REVIEWER]
