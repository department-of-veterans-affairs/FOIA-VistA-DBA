  Server Installation Instructions:
  =================================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Surgery users are processing orders.
  
  Installation will take about 5 minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
       be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*145)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*145
  
    6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//" respond NO.

       Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
    8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
