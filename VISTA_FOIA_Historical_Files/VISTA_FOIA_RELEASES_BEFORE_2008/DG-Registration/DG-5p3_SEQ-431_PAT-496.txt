Subject: MODIFY ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM FIELD IN PATIENT FILE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch will address <UNDEF(ECODE)>DEFACK+3^HLCSIN:5 reported in
 HUN-0203-20067 and BAY-0103-32423.
  
 The above two NOIS deal with the ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM (field #.118 of
 the PATIENT (#2) file).  Currently the #.118 is set up as a Date/Time data
 type with the time value required.  The NCOA data contained in the RF1
 segment of Z05 messages coming from the AAC only contains a date.  This 
 discrepancy is causing the error noted by the two NOIS listed above.
 After the installation of this patch, field #.118 of the Patient file 
 (#2) will accept data consisting of a Date or a Date/Time.

 Routine Summary:
 ================
  
 There are no routines in this patch.  It contains only a Data Dictionary 
 change to the ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM (field #.118 of the PATIENT (#2) file).
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 This patch can be installed with users on the system and will take
 less than a minute to install.  It is also recommended placing Taskman
 in a wait state until after the installation is complete.  This will
 prevent the potential loss of patient data.  If Taskman is not placed
 in a wait state it is recommended that this patch be installed at a time
 when there are not many users on the system.
  
   1. Since there are no routines included in this patch there is no 
      reason to review your mapped set.
  
   2. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
   4. From this menu, you need only  to use the following option (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*496).
  
      a. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      DG*5.3*496.
  
   6. When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//' answer NO.
