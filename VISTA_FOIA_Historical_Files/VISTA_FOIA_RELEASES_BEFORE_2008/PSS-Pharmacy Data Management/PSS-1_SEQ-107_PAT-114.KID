1. In response to a patient safety issue, the Computerized Patient Record 
"BLD",5720,1,2,0)
System V. 1.0 was modified to no longer always use a default in the 
"BLD",5720,1,3,0)
medication ordering dialog. Therefore, sites are required to enter a 
"BLD",5720,1,4,0)
default in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). However, in support 
"BLD",5720,1,5,0)
of the previous business logic, a default of ORAL was not allowed. This 
"BLD",5720,1,6,0)
patch changes this requirement and allows ORAL as a default medication 
"BLD",5720,1,7,0)
route. HD 144208, PSI-06-063
"BLD",5720,1,8,0)
 
"BLD",5720,1,9,0)
2. In order to assist sites in assigning a new default medication route, 
"BLD",5720,1,10,0)
a utility is provided to allow assignment of a route to multiple 
"BLD",5720,1,11,0)
orderable items, based on the dosage form. A new menu option has been set 
"BLD",5720,1,12,0)
up for this feature. The new menu option is [PSS ADD DEFAULT MED ROUTE] 
"BLD",5720,1,13,0)
and will be removed in a future patch.
