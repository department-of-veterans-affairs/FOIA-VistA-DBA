Subject: UNDEFINED VARIABLE IN IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY

Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch fixes problems associated with the questions asked during
 the Maintenance Utility for Active/Inactive Codes [IBDF UTIL
 MAINTENANCE UTILITY] option. The primary purpose of this option
 is to allow users to validate the items that are printed on an encounter
 form and are not inactivated.  The following changes have been made:
  
     When the user attempts to select the type of data to be validated,
     they will be presented with a list of only those items that have
     validating logic.  Previously, the list was longer and contained items
     that could not be validated.
  
     The user will only be allowed to search for Active CPT and ICD
     related data, including the "Type of Visit", a subset of valid CPT
     codes.  This change will prevent an <UNDEF>error from occuring
     when attempting to search for other types of active items, such as
     Clinical Lexicon entries.
    
  This patch resolves NOIS LON-0398-61712.
    
   If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
   following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
   disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
   Other DHCP users will not be affected.
