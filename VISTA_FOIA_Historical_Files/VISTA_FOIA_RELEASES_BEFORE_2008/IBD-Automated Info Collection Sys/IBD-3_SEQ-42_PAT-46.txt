Subject: PROBLEM PRINT EF TO HOST FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Problems have been found with printing Encounter Forms to a VMS Queue
 using Host Files.  When the first Encounter Form is printed and the print
 is "reset" to the original settings in the specified terminal type, a
 second VMS file is opened.  When the final printing is completed, the
 first VMS file is closed leaving the second VMS file open.  Therefore,
 unless the second VMS file is manually closed or forced to print, it will
 not print.  This problem is resolved by resetting the printer with a
 direct call to the %ZIS global instead of a call to the ^%ZIS routine.
