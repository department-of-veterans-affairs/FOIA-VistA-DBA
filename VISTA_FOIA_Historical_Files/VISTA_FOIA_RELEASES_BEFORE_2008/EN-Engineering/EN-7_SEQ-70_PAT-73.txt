Subject: File 6914 Equipment Inventory, field #11 Purchase Order Number

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses the problem of entering a Purchase Order Number
 containing an "E", which the system fails to accept.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1.  DUR-0601-32547     DD file# 6914
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The system language, in some cases, treats the "E" in a number string as
    an exponential notation (For instance "1E3" would equate to "1000").
    Due to this "E" exponential notation, the value of the Purchase Order
    Number becomes too large for the system to handle and the system issues
    the error "illegal number".  See Example below:
  
          1      New Inventory Entry
          2      Multiple Inventory Entry
          3      Inventory Edit

       PURCHASE ORDER #: 1E123456 
       %DSM-E-NUMBER, illegal number
       %DSM-I-ATLABEL, IT+3^DIR1:1     . X $P(%B3,U,5,99)
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Correct the input screening of the Purchase Order Number to view the
    entry as a character string and not as a numeric value.  Hence, not
    evoking the exponential logic which expanded the Purchase Order Number.
    
    Example: 
          1      New Inventory Entry
          2      Multiple Inventory Entry

 TECHNICAL:
 --------- 
 In "MUMPS math operations" the "E" in a number string denotes an
 exponential notation.  (For instance "1E3" would equate to "1000").  The
 INPUT TRANSFORM for the PURCHASE ORDER # (#11) field in the EQUIPMENT INV.
 (#6914) file contains a math operation (X<0) (testing the input for a
 negative value).  This expression will equate "E" as an exponential
 notation.  In some cases the value of the input Purchase Order number
 becomes too large for the system to handle.  The INPUT TRANSFORM already
 has a test for a leading negative character (-) earlier, which makes the
 test for a negative value redundant as well as invalid.  The negative
 value check (X<0) has been removed from the INPUT TRANSFORM.
