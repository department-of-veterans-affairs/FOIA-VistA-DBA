Subject: NO ASSOCIATED CLINIC DATA IN REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will remove the logic that only allows the Associated Clinic 
 to print on the Practitioner's Patients Report and the Team Patient 
 Listing if the patient is enrolled in the Associated Clinic found in the 
 TEAM POSITION (#404.57) file.  Clinic enrollment is discretionary and not
 used by all sites, therefore, the Associated Clinic assigned to the TEAM
 POSITION (#404.57) file should print on these reports.  Additionally, the
 requested changes that were made with patch SD*5.3*432 will be returned
 to their original state as it was decided by the PCMM User's Group, that
 these changes should not have been made.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ============================
 1)  HD63324 - No associated clinic data in reports
       duplicate -HD63348 - MAS: Provider's Patients Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Practitioner's Patients Report and the Team Patient Listing only
     print the Associated Clinic if the patient is enrolled in the
     Associated Clinic assigned to the TEAM POSITION (#404.57) file. Clinic
     enrollment is discretionary and not used by all sites, therefore,
     these reports should print the Associated Clinic assigned to the TEAM
     POSITION (#404.57) file regardless whether or not the patient is
     enrolled in that clinic.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The logic to check if the patient is enrolled in the Associated Clinic
     assigned to the TEAM POSITION (#404.57) file, will be removed in
     routines SCRPTP3 and SCRPPAT2.
  
 2)  HD101801 - Team Patient List no longer consistently displaying future 
                appts
       duplicates - HD102639 - problems with practitioner patient rpt
                    HD103574 - PCMM "Practitioner Report" is changed
                    HD104846 - Practitioner's Patient list after SD*5.3*432
                    HD104939 - Default Summary
                    HD106871 - Possible error on PCMM Practitioners report
                    HD108481 - Practitioner's Patients Report
  
     Problem:
     --------
     It was decided by the PCMM User's Group, that the requested changes
     introduced with patch SD*5.3*432, regarding the Last and Next
     Appointment data that is printed on these same reports, should not
     have been made.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The logic contained in the GETLAST and GETNEXT API's within routine
     SCRPU3 will be changed back to what it was prior to patch SD*5.3*432.
     That is, the patient's last appointment and next appointment
     information will only print when the appointments were in the same
     clinic as the Associated Clinic found in the Team Position file
     (404.57).
