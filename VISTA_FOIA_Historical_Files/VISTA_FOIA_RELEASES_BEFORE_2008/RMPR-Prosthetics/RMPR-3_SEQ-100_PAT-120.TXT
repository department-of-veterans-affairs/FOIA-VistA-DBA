Subject: INQ SUSPENSE PROBLEM; CONSULT CLONING, INACTIVE ICD9; PCE BACKGROUND TASK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 THIS PATCH WILL ADDRESS THREE ISSUES:
  
 1. Up-arrow out of option [RMPR INQ SUSPENSE] and going to option 
    [RMPR SUSP] will use the same patient from the initial inquiry, 
    instead of prompting for new patient name.
  
 2. When cloning consults, inactive ICD9-codes are carried to new order.  
    This causes an error message to be generated the next day via the
    mailman message:  "PROSTHETICS PCE BACKGROUND MESSAGE".
  
 3. Bad entries (null) in the VISIT File (9000010) when RMPR PCE 
    BACKGROUND job running.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD55228    Can't pull up suspense record.
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Up-arrow out of option [RMPR INQ SUSPENSE] and going to option 
    [RMPR SUSP] will use the same patient from the initial inquiry, 
    instead of prompting for new patient name.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify routine RMPRS to kill the variable RMPRDFN when exiting
    option.
  
  
 2. HD125009  Consult cloning carries over inactive ICD9 codes.
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Consult cloning carries over inactive ICD9 diagnosis codes.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify routines RMPRPCEA and RMPRPCEB to ignore suspense transaction 
    processing to PCE if provisional diagnosis or suspense order related 
    diagnosis are inactive.  Although the cloning of  consults with
    inactive provisional diagnosis will be allowed,  these routines were
    modified to ignore suspense  transaction processing to PCE if either
    provisional diagnosis or suspense order related diagnosis are inactive.
    Because the encounters are not transmitted to PCE workload will not be
    captured on these consults.
  
  
 3. HD64887   Bad entries in VISIT FILE occurring when RMPR PCE
              BACKGROUND runs.
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Prosthetics background job creating null visit nodes due to excessive
    creating/deleting for error conditions.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    a.  Sites MUST have all Prosthetics users set up with an active
        Person Class in New Person File based on previously distributed
        guidelines.
    b.  Modify RMPRPCEB to start at correct node in File #660 when
        doing nightly RMPR PCE BACKGROUND task.
