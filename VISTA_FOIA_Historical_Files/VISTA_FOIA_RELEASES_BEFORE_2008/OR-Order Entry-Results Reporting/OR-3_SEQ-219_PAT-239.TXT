Subject: FIX REMOTE DATA BUTTON BROKEN BY HDR PUSH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch address a problem that surfaced when the HDR went
  live on 7/27/05.  At that time the HDR added a new Treating
  Facility to the Treating Facility List file (#391.91) called 
  "HDR (available soon)"  Because of this, HDR is now considered
  a remote site by CPRS, since it contains every patient's vital
  signs from every site entered since that date. CPRS GUI v25 RDV
  now shows "HDR (available soon)" in the Remote Site list, and the
  Remote Data button is always blue-highlighted (active), since now
  there is always data (but the user can't retrieve it). 
  This patch basically will restore the functionality to the way it
  was prior to HDR going live on 7/27/05, which means that the
  "HDR (available soon)" selection will be screened out, so that
  it will not be displayed, selectable or used in the RDV logic
  for CPRS GUI v25. The Remote Data button will be grayed-out if
  the patient only has local data.
