Subject: Saturday Premium Report 12/6/03 - 1/10/04

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will generate a report containing a list of employees who are
 covered under Public Law 108-170, and who worked on a Saturday in PP 
 03-24, 03-25, or 03-26. The report will contain the employees' timecard
 for the pay period, along with the 8B string that was transmitted to
 Central PAID, and several fields that the Payroll staff will need to
 determine if the employee was paid correctly, and if needed, to calculate
 any back pay that may be due the employee.
  
 The report is created by a pre-install routine that will automatically run
 when the patch is installed, and it's e-mailed to the employee who
 installs the patch. This person will need to deliver the report to the
 appropriate Payroll Personnel.  
  
 This is a one-time report, and therefore will not be added to the VistA 
 PAID/ETA v 4.0 software. The sites may delete routine PRSXP89 after the 
 patch has been installed, and the report has been turned over to Payroll.
  
 The report in this patch was created in response to a request by the 
 Central PAID office.  The following instructions have been supplied by 
 them to help you determine what actions you need to take:
  
                     Office of Financial Policy (047GA2)
                                Briefing Note
  
 Subject:  Draft 047GA2 Notice 04.007, Retroactive Weekend Premium Pay for 
 Title 38 Hybrids 
  
 Discussion:  Effective December 6, 2003, Section 301(a) of Public Law 
 108-170, added 19 title 5 competitive service occupations to the hybrid 
 title 38 personnel system.  As a result of this change, employees in the 
 associated occupation and title codes, (see Attachment to draft 047GA2 
 Notice 04-007), are entitled to weekend pay retroactive to December 6, 
 2003.  In PAID, employees in these occupation and title codes are 
 currently coded as title 5 health care workers, (resulting from section 
 303, of Public Law 108-170), and they began receiving Saturday pay 
 effective January 11, 2004. 
  
 The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) requested that VA 
 pay employees in the 19 occupation and title codes immediately for the 
 period of December 6, 2003 through January 10, 2004. VA agreed and 
 anticipated that payment for this period could be made within 60 days of 
 VA's March 5, 2004, response.  The Payroll and Records Management 
 Division (047GA2) advised HR's Compensation and Benefits Division (051A) 
 that most payments will likely be paid shortly after the 60 day 
 anticipated deadline, mostly due to the efforts to correct VA's pay 
 period 6 retro pay overpayments.  051A has relayed this information to 
 HR's labor relations management division.  
  
 This notice will provide payroll offices with instructions needed to make 
 payments for employees entitled to weekend pay from December 6, 2003 to 
 January 10, 2004. This adjustment period is referred to as Phase I in 
 the attached draft notice. Additional adjustments, Phase II, will be 
 needed for this same group of employees once PAID and ETA are programmed 
 to automatically pay premium pay for this group of employees. Phase II 
 adjustments are expected in September 2004. To assist payroll offices in 
 identifying affected employees, an ETA patch will be distributed as soon 
 as this notice becomes final. This patch will provide employee name, 
 SSN, and the weekend hours worked from December 6, 2003 to January 10, 
 2004. Instructions in this notice will guide payroll offices in making 
 the proper adjustments based on employee type and hours worked.
  
  
                     RETROACTIVE WEEKEND PREMIUM PAY
                          FOR TITLE 38 HYBRIDS
  
 1.  PURPOSE:  This notice provides payroll processing instructions for 
 the retroactive payment of weekend premium (Sunday and Saturday) pay to 
 employees in occupations converted to the hybrid title 38 personnel 
 system effective December 6, 2003.  This notice provides instructions 
 only for the period December 6, 2003 through January 10, 2004, for 
 employees in occupations listed in Attachment.  Once PAID and ETA is 
 modified to automatically pay weekend premium pay for these employees, 
 additional payroll processing instructions will be issued.
  
 2.  BACKGROUND
  
 a.  Section 301(a) of Public Law 108-170 converted the occupation and 
 title codes in Attachment from the title 5 competitive service to the 
 hybrid title 38 personnel system effective December 6, 2003.  Employees 
 in these occupation and title codes are entitled to weekend premium pay 
 retroactive to December 6, 2003.  However, due to a delay in 
 reprogramming PAID and ETA, and for other reasons, the retroactive 
 payment of weekend premium pay must be processed by local payroll offices 
 in two phases.
  
 Phase I:  Payroll offices will process retroactive weekend premium pay 
 adjustments from December 6, 2003 through January 10, 2004, for employees 
 in occupation and title codes listed in Attachment.  Efforts should be 
 made to process Phase 1 adjustments as soon as possible but no later than 
 June 1, 2004.
  
 Phase II:  Payroll offices will process retroactive weekend premium pay 
 adjustments from January 11, 2004 through the pay period prior to PAID 
 and ETA being reprogrammed.  
  
 This notice only pertains to adjustments required for Phase 1.
  
 b.  In an Outlook e-mail to VHA Payroll Group and VAFSC PAID STATION LIST 
 dated January 23, 2004, Bonnie Autry, VHA Financial Liaison Office 
 (173B), issued draft instructions entitled "Title 5 Health Care Workers' 
 Entitlement to Saturday Premium Pay".  In the attachment to that e-mail 
 entitled "VHA Health Care Occupations Eligible For Saturday Premium Pay", 
 72 title 5 health care occupations were listed as eligible for Saturday 
 premium pay effective pay period 1, 2004 (January 11th).  Nineteen (19) 
 of those occupations are now eligible for weekend pay as a hybrid 
 employee retroactive to December 6, 2003.  The occupation and title code 
 (first six digits of the occupation series) must be used to identify 
 hybrid employees eligible for weekend premium pay.  For example, although 
 all employees in occupation code 0601, General Health Science, are 
 considered title 5 health care workers entitled to Saturday pay, only 
 employees in occupation and title codes 060113, Nuclear Medical 
 Technologist, are now considered hybrids entitled to weekend pay 
 retroactive to December 6, 2003.
  
 c.  Employees in the new 19 hybrid occupations are currently coded in 
 PAID as title 5 health care workers (premium pay code S) and they began 
 receiving Saturday pay effective January 11, 2004.  Once PAID and ETA are 
 programmed, these employees will be automatically converted to their 
 hybrid status (pay plan A with appointment type 5 or 6) and will begin 
 receiving weekend pay.  Upon conversion, additional instructions will be 
 issued advising payroll offices to process Phase II adjustments for these 
 employees. Since most of these employees are already receiving Sunday pay 
 under title 5 and Saturday pay as a title 5 health care worker, Phase II 
 adjustments will generally only affect overtime on a Sunday tour for 
 full-time employees and regular plus overtime hours on a Sunday tour for 
 part-time and intermittent employees.
  
 d.  Employees in the new hybrid occupations should be aware of the delay 
 in receiving the retroactive payments as human resource offices were 
 instructed to advise them.  The following is an excerpt of a sample 
 letter to employees contained in HRML 05-04-02 dated March 17, 2004, 
 Attachment A(:
  
 "The change to hybrid status does not affect your current grade, 
 step or salary rate.  In addition to your basic pay, you are now entitled 
 to title 38 premium pay at the rate of 25 percent of your basic hourly 
 rate of pay for each hour of service on a tour of duty, any part of which 
 is between midnight Friday and midnight Sunday.  This weekend premium pay 
 entitlement was effective December 6, 2003.  You began receiving 
 additional pay for all Saturday hours worked after January 11, 2004 on 
 the normal pay date.  However, additional changes must be made to the 
 payroll system for Saturday hours worked between December 6, 2003 and 
 January 11, 2004 and the changes in the pay entitlement for all Sunday 
 hours worked since December 6, 2003.  You will receive this pay 
 retroactively once the system changes are accomplished."
  
  
 3.  Phase 1 Adjustments
  
 a.  To assist payroll offices in identifying employees and processing 
 adjustments for Phase 1, ETA patch PRS*4.0*89 will be issued to local IRM 
 offices on/about May 07, 2004.  This patch will produce a listing of all 
 hours worked for employees in the 19 hybrid occupations from midnight 
 Friday to midnight Sunday, December 6, 2003 through January 10, 2004.  
 Local payroll offices must review the ETA listing and the amounts paid to 
 each employee to determine if weekend pay is payable.  The following 
 should be considered when determining entitlement to weekend pay for 
 Phase I:
  
 b.  Full-time employees (Regular Hours - Sunday):  For the most part, 
 full-time employees who worked their regular tour of duty between 
 midnight Saturday and midnight Sunday already received Sunday pay under 
 title 5 based on 2087 as the divisor to determine the hourly rate of 
 Sunday pay.  Now these employees are entitled to Sunday pay under title 
 38 based on 2080.  Although the difference is relatively small, employees 
 are entitled to the additional pay.
  
 c.  Full-time employees (Regular Hours - Saturday):  Full-time employees 
 who worked their regular tour of duty any part of which was between 
 midnight Friday and midnight Saturday did not originally receive 
 Saturday pay for such hours under title 5.  Now, however, these employees 
 are entitled to Saturday pay under title 38 for regular hours worked on a 
 tour of duty any part of which was between midnight Friday and midnight 
 Saturday.  For example, the ETA listing may show a full-time employee 
 working regular hours from 7 AM to 3:30 PM on Saturday, December 6, 
 2003.  Since Saturday pay was not originally paid for these hours, the 
 employee is now entitled to 25% of the basic hourly rate of pay for 8 
 hours.
  
 d.  Full-time Employees (Overtime Hours):  Full-time employees who worked 
 overtime were not entitled to Sunday or Saturday pay under title 5 when 
 the original timecard was processed.  Now, however, these employees are 
 entitled to Sunday and Saturday pay for such overtime hours under title 
 38 if the overtime hours were worked on a tour of duty.  Upon reviewing 
 the ETA listing, payroll offices must have timekeepers certify, as 
 needed, whether overtime was worked on a tour duty.  If the overtime was 
 worked on a tour of duty, employees are entitled to 25% of the basic 
 hourly rate of pay for Sunday and Saturday overtime hours worked on a 
 tour of duty any part of which was between midnight Friday and midnight 
 Sunday.  If the overtime was not worked on a tour of duty, employees are 
 not entitled to Sunday or Saturday pay for such hours.
  
 e.  Part-time and Intermittent Employees (Regular/Unscheduled Hours):  
 Part-time and intermittent employees who worked regular or unscheduled 
 hours on a tour of duty any part of which was between midnight Friday 
 and midnight Sunday were not entitled to Sunday or Saturday pay under 
 title 5 when the original timecard was processed.  Now, however, 
 employees are entitled to 25% of the basic hourly rate of pay for Sunday 
 and Saturday hours worked on a tour of duty any part of which was between 
 midnight Friday and midnight Sunday.  If the regular or unscheduled 
 hours were not worked on a tour of duty, employees are not entitled to 
 Sunday or Saturday pay.
  
 f.  Part-time and Intermittent Employees (Overtime Hours):  Part-time and 
 intermittent employees who worked overtime hours on a tour of duty any 
 part of which was between midnight Friday and midnight Sunday were not 
 entitled to Sunday or Saturday pay for such hours under title 5 when the 
 original timecard was processed.  Now, however, employees are entitled to 
 Sunday and Saturday under title 38 if such overtime hours were worked on 
 a tour of duty.  Upon reviewing the ETA listing, payroll offices must 
 have timekeepers certify, as needed, whether the overtime was worked on a 
 tour of duty.  If the overtime was worked on a tour of duty, employees are
 entitled to 25% of the basic hourly rate of pay for Sunday and Saturday 
 overtime hours worked on a tour of duty any part of which was between 
 midnight Friday and midnight Sunday.  If the overtime was not worked on 
 a tour of duty, the employee is not entitled to Sunday or Saturday pay 
 for such hours.
  
 4.  TIME FRAME FOR PROCESSING PHASE I ADJUSTMENTS:  Due to VA's 
 commitment to a national labor bargaining unit, efforts should be made to 
 process Phase I pay adjustments as soon as possible and no later than 
 June 1, 2004.
