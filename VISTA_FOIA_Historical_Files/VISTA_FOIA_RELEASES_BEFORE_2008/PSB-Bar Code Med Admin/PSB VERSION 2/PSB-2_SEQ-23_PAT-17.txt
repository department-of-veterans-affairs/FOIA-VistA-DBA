Description:
============

 The VistA Bar Code Medical Administration Backup System (BCBU)
 provides a Class I solution as requested per BCMA Contingency IRA #20020403.
 This plan reflects the intent of VHA Directive 6210, The Automated Information
 Systems (AIS) Security, which states that all facilities are responsible
 for the development, maintenance, and annual testing of individual AIS 
 contingency.  The software maintains a real time copy, on the designated 
 workstation, of all the inpatient pharmacy activities for current inpatients.
 The patient data (inpatient med orders (Unit Dose and IV); the medication
 administration record; patient's allergies) that is included on the 
 Pharmacy Medical Administration Record (MAR) and Medical Administration 
 History (MAH) is maintained. Workstation(s) are updated using the 
 VA Health Level (HL7) package.  Access to the contingency workstation will 
 be determined by local policies and procedures.
 
 NOTE:   This back-up system is being released under the BCMA namespace.  
 However, in the National Online Information Sharing (NOIS) system, it is 
 entered as a separate module.  The module is BCBU - BCMA Contingency Plan.  
 Please use this module, BCBU, when logging a NOIS ticket.
 
 ===============================================================
 The BCMA Backup System (BCBU) PSB*2*17 patch is being released at 
 this time for support of Cache BCMA Workstations only!
 
 In addition to the required patches for PSB*2*17 there are several Kernel, 
 FileMan, Mailman and HL7 patches (XU*8*275, XT*7.3*70, HL*1.6*108, 
 DI*22*110, XM*8*19) required to run with GT.M/Linux and some are still 
 being tested.  The estimate time for the completion of the testing and 
 release is December 2003. In the interim those interested are welcome 
 to run the Class III version of the GT.M/Linux as a test site until the 
 Class I patches are released. To request the software and documentation 
 required for using GT.M/Linux log a NOIS with your request to the BCBU 
 module.

 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. 
 
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
 specific server as follows:
 
 OI FIELD OFFICE FTP ADDRESS DIRECTORY
 
        Albany ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov anonymous.software
        Hines ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov anonymous.software
        Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov anonymous.software
 
 The documentation distribution includes: 
 
 BCMA Backup System Cache Installation.doc
 BCMA Backup System Installation Guide.doc
 
 Contingency Workstation:
 =================================
 The software distribution includes:
 
 
 For Cache workstation 
 --------------------------- 
 Cache.zip
 Cache.dat
 
 These are the same files the zip was created to help downloading and would 
 need to be unzipped. 
 All these files should be ftp'd BINARY. 
 
 To obtain the software use one the following OI Field Offices' 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:
 
 OI FIELD OFFICE FTP Address Directory
        Albany ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov anonymous.software

 =============================================================
 
 The Vista side of the patch can be loaded with users on the system. 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
     Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
       
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be 
        removed from the mapped set at this time. 
    
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the 
        Installation menu.
   
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when 
        prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSB*2.0*17)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with the patch. 
         It will NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the 
         integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSB*2.0*17.
   
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
        Install?  YES//" respond NO
   
     7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        YES//" respond NO.

        PSJU VBW  Non-Verified/Pending Orders
 
     9. At the "Request Start Time: NOW//" prompt, press ENTER to accept the 
        default of NOW. If you want, you can schedule the install to run 
        at a later date.
   
    10. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
