 NOIS/REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  
  ==============
 1)  HD0000000064271/WPB-1004-30229     UTILIZATION MGMT ROLLUP
  
   
 Problem: 
  --------
 This problem happens because the Utilization Management Rollup package,
 using the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION (#40.8) file for reporting, treats each
 site's FACILITY NUMBER (#2) field and INSTITUTION FILE POINTER (#7) field
 as the same, although they are different.  While trying to report, it uses
 the institution file pointer instead of the facility number and this causes
 problems with report transmission and formatting.
   
 Resolution:
  -----------
 This patch modifies the routines to pull the FACILITY NUMBER (#2) field
 instead of the INSTITUTION FILE POINTER (#7) field, where the facility number 
 is the desired result.
   
   
   
 2)  HD0000000092595                    Disable data transfer option
  
 Problem: 
  --------
 There is an option within Utilization Management Rollup-Transmit Rollup
 Data [IBQL TRANSMIT DATA] that allows a site to transmit data to a national
 database located at the Hines OI Field Office.  This database is no longer
 active and is being removed from the Hines system.  Therefore, this option
 needs to be disabled.
  
 Resolution:
  -----------
 With installation of this patch the Transmit Rollup Data [IBQL TRANSMIT DATA]
 option will be removed.

                      Pre-Install Instructions                              
                                                                             
  Prior to installation, please check to see if the correct version (V1) of  
  Utilization Management Rollup (IBQ) has been installed.  It appears that   
  in most sites this package was incorrectly installed under Utilization     
  Mgmt Rollup Local (IBQL), which is not a valid package.  This patch will   
  not install unless version 1 of Utilization Management Rollup (IBQ) has    
  been installed.  Below are instructions on how to merge all installation   
  data from the Uilization Mgmt Rollup Local (IBQL) package into Utilization 
  Management Rollup (IBQ).                                                   
   
  If Utilization Management Rollup (IBQ)  version 1 has already been 
  installed, and the package file entry appears to be complete, proceed to 
  to the install.  There would be no need to do the merge.
