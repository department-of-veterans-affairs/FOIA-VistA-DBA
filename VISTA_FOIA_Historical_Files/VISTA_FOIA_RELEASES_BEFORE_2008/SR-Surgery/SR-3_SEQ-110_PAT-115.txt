Description: 
============

 This patch is created in support of directive 2002-070, ENSURING CORRECT 
 SURGERY.
  
 The patch adds two new fields in the SURGERY file (#130).  They are 
 needed to document that the operating room team performed a "time out" to 
 ensure that the correct surgery is being done.  The new fields are:
   1. TIME OUT VERIFIED (#71)
   2. IMAGING CONFIRMED (#72)
  
 The new fields will be editable on the OPERATION (SHORT SCREEN)  
 [SROMEN-OUT] and OPERATION STARTUP  [SROMEN-START] options. These fields
 will now appear on the NURSE INTRAOPERATIVE REPORT [SRONRPT].
