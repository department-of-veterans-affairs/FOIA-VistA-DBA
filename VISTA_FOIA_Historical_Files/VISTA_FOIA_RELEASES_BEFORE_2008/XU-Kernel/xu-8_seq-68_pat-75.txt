Description: 
============

  
  DAY-1097-42595 XQALSET  During testing of TIU it was found that alerts
                          get sent to users that have been terminated. TIU
                          suggested that a change to ALERTS to not sent
                          alerts to user that can't sign-on.
                          
                 XUSER    As part of the change to XQALSET a API was created
                          ACTIVE^XUSER to check if the user can sign-on.
                          It returns the following codes:
                          ""  No user record.
                          0   User can't sign-on.
                          0^DISUSER  User can't sign-on because of DISUSER flag.
                          0^TERMINATED^2980310  User terminated on date.
                          1^NEW  A new user, could sign-on.
                          1^ACTIVE^2980310.09  A active user, last sign-on date.

  Installation:
  
    1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines. 
       
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
        
           Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
       
    4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
        user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
        acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
       
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        option:
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*75'
                               =========
          
       
    6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set and 
        enable user logins.
