 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 CLL-0503-40016         Lowercase orderable item pulls from drug text entry
 HD0000000067623
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There are three cross-references on the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
 (#50.7) used during lookup: "B", "C", "DTXT".  The "DTXT" cross-reference
 is a pointer to the DRUG TEXT file (#51.7).  During the lookup process,
 all lookup cross-references on the 'pointed to' file (#51.7) are searched
 as well as the "B" and "C" cross-references in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE 
 ITEM file (#50.7).  If there is a match on the search string in the Name
 or Synonym cross-references in the DRUG TEXT file (#51.7), these will be
 included in the list as well. This does not work when a lowercase entry is
 typed in.  When lowercase entries are converted to uppercase (after no
 lowercase match is found), the indexes of 'pointed to' files are searched
 first, and if a partial match is found, it is selected and the search
 stops, i.e. does not continue on to main file cross-references.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify the data dictionary to prompt if Drug Text should also be added as a
 synonym when adding a new drug text to an orderable item.
 Modify the code to no longer look at the "DTXT" cross-reference during a
 look-up.  Create a report displaying any orderable items that are set up as
 a Drug Text but not as a Synonym. 
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch modifies the data dictionary for the OI-DRUG TEXT ENTRY field (#6)
 in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).  If the user adds a new Drug
 Text, they will be prompted if they also want to add the Drug Text as a
 Synonym, field #2.  This is accomplished by adding a MUMPS style
 cross-reference to the OI-DRUG TEXT ENTRY field (#6).
