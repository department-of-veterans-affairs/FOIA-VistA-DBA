Subject: HIPAA CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS - PHASE II CHANGES

Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

  The objective of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  
  Act (HIPAA) Confidential Communication Project is to develop and  
  deploy enhancements to the Veterans Health Information System and 
  Technology Architecture (VistA) software to comply with HIPAA rules 
  for Confidential Communication 45 CFR 164.552.  
  
  Registration has been asked to provide the Fee Basis application with  
  the ability to edit the confidential address fields and to track  
  changes to permanent and confidential address fields.  The following 
  modifications will be made to provide this functionality:
  
  1.  Post-initialization routine DG53527P adds a cross reference to 
  several confidential address and permanent address fields.  This cross 
  reference tasks a job to execute the protocols attached to the DG FIELD 
  MONITOR protocol.  This event point gives the subscribing protocols the 
  ability to monitor activity on the address fields.  
  
  Cross references will be added to the following fields:
  
  Field Name                             Field #             Cross  
                                                            Reference

  2.  The existing logic in routine DGDDC only executed traditional  
  cross references and the existing logic in DGLOCK3 assumed the 
  confidential address fields were not cross referenced.  FILE^DIE call
  was added to both routines to assure both traditional and new style
  cross references are executed.
  
  3.  An additional input parameter value was added to QUES^DGRPU1.  An 
  application calling this module with "ADD4" as the second input parameter
  will be prompted for the confidential address fields.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users but should be installed during  
  non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users.  Installation will  
  take less than 5 minutes.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.] 
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
      ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
      from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*527): 
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch  
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
          the components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      DG*5.3*527.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      YES??//',respond NO.
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
        Register a Patient                   DG REGISTER PATIENT 
        Load/Edit Patient Data               DG LOAD PATIENT DATA
        Eligibility Verification             DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION
        Preregister a Patient                DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION
  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
   
  9.  Post-initialization routine DG53527P may be deleted after  
      successful installation of this patch.
