Description:
============

 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
 with the Patient Medication Instruction Sheet (PMI) portion of the
 National Drug File (NDF) application.  The seven files are:
    50.621        PMI-ENGLISH              
    50.622        PMI-SPANISH              
    50.623        PMI MAP-ENGLISH          
    50.624        PMI MAP-SPANISH          
    50.625        WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH    
    50.626        WARNING LABEL-SPANISH    
    50.627        WARNING LABEL MAP     
  
 The environment check routine for this patch, PSN115E, checks to see  
 that the installer is a valid user.
 The post-install routine for this patch, PSN115P, deletes existing
 entries in these files, loads the new data, and rematches entries in
 the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to the proper PMIs.
 The source of the data for the PMIs is First Data Bank.
