Subject: wrong processing routine being executed for VistA HL7 apps

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Test sites:    Birmingham, North Texas NCS (Dallas), Grand Junction,
                Milwaukee, Sheridan
  
 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
  1.  ISH-1000-42883  wrong processing routine being executed for
                      VistA HL7 apps
  2.  SDC-1100-60210  Problem with HL7/Radiology link
  
 Note:          This patch requires that KIDS build HL*1.6*66
                be installed.
  
  The wrong processing routine is being executed (EN^RGADT)
  for non-MPI/PD applications.  This causes a MPI/PD exception to be
  generated and sent to Forum.
  
  This problem was originally identified in Milwaukee when the Dictaphone
  application tried to execute a MPI/PD processing routine (EN^RGADT).
  
  Most recently, the problem appeared at the Birmingham VAMC.  Some user
  inactivated a Lab interface application which caused an endless loop
  creating application acks that were never received/processed because the
  VistA HL7 application was inactivated.
  
  The problem lies in the CONT^HLTP3 subroutines, the HL("EIDS") variable,
  defining the subscribing protocol, is not defined.  The software sets the
  HL("EIDS") variable to HLEIDS.  The value of HLEIDS is not reliable, in
  most cases the variable has not been properly set/killed.
  
  In addition, the inbound filers were not locking the cross-reference
  ^HLMA("AC","I",... in order to flush to global cache buffers.
  
  In this case, the HL7 link receiving a message for an application
  kills the cross-reference(entry in the inbound tcp/ip queue),
  releases other locks, the inbound filers kicks in and grabs the lock at a
  different parent level ^HLMA(ien), checks for the existence of
  ^HLMA("AC","I",LLien,MSGien) and since no locking was performed on this
  cross-reference, this piece of code thinks this entry exists.  Hence, the
  inbound filers begin to process this message, finds
  variables left around from a previous message(MPI/PD or HL7 itself),
  invokes code that uses these variables to set other HL7 variables when
  these variables itself are not setup properly.  This in turn causes the
  code to call the MPI/PD application which in turn fires off exception
  messages to Forum.
  
  These problems may be triggered by an inbound HL7 message that was not
  properly constructed in terms of the HL7 MSH segment.  The VistA HL7
  software needs from the MSH segment, the Sending/Receiving Application
  names, Message Type, Event Type and Version ID.
  The HL7 Protocol setups may also have triggered this problem if the data
  in the MSH segment of an inbound message does not match the interface
  definition setups.
  
  Therefore, sites will still need to correct problems with their local
  interfaces. This patch only prevents the wrong application from being
  executed.

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  
  
   2.  DSM SITES: Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in 
       the Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from 
       the mapped set at this time.  
  
   3.  Shutdown all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers, and 
       the Link Manager. Use the options: 
  
         Filer and Link Management Options -> 
             SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes 
             LM     TCP/IP Link Manager Start/Stop 
  
       For DSM sites ONLY, disable all HL7 UCX Services 
       for this installation.  
  
   4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
  
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
       options: 
  
          2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
          3 Print Transport Global 
          4 Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          5 Backup a Transport Global 
          6 Install Package(s) 
              INSTALL NAME: HL*1.6*69 
                            =========
  
         Answer 'NO' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?'.  
  
         Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
          and Protocols?'.  
  
   6.  Startup all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers. Use the 
  
         Filer and Link Management Options -> 
             RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers 
         (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need to 
         be restarted manually) 
  
       For DSM sites ONLY, if you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service 
       for this installation, you may now enable it.  
  
   7.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.  
  
   8.  Start Link Manager using the option: "TCP/IP 
         Link Manager Start/Stop."
