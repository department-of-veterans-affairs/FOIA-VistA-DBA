Description: 
============

  
  E-Sig Improvements
   
  New E-SIG functions so that other developers can follow the General
  Counsels guidelines on E-SIG. This comes from a meeting at Birmingham on
  9/18-20/95.  New routine XUSESIG1.
   
  Changes to the New Person file:
   Added a DEGREE field to hold MD, RN, LPN...
   Added a DATE E-SIG LAST CHANGED field.  The seeding of the this field
   will be done by taking the current date+random(60)+30 days to give a date
   when the user will need to select a new E-SIG code.
  The option XUSESIG BLOCK is included in this patch.
    
  KERNEL functions to help developers.
   
  $$CHKSUM^XUSESIG1($name_value,flag)
  This would take a root ($name_value) and build a checksum for all data in
  the
  root. (Not used now, flag would be used when there is more that one
  checksum
  algorithm.)
   
  $$ESBLOCK^XUSESIG1(ien)
  This extrinsic function would return the set of fields from the new 
  person file that are need as part of the hash for a acceptable E-Sig. 
  If IEN is not passed in then DUZ is used.
  (E-Sig block, E-Sig title, Degree, Current Date/Time)
   
  $$EN^XUSESIG1(checksum,esblock)
  If the ESBLOCK is not passed then the function would get the ESBLOCK. In 
  either case this extrinsic function would encode the ESBLOCK using the 
  checksum as the KEY.  Return a encoded string.  
   
  $$CMP^XUSESIG1(checksum,$name_value)
  The extrinsic function would compare the checksum passed in to the 
  calculated value from the $NAME_VALUE.  Return 1 for match, 0 for no 
  match.
   
  $$DE^XUSESIG1(checksum,encoded_string)
  This extrinsic function would decode the string using the checksum as 
  the key.  Return a decoded string.

  Installation:
   
    1.  These routines may be mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
        On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Backup a Transport Global
    4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
        user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
        acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
    5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*14'
    6.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
