Subject: MPI CHANGES - ITERATION 1

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
  of Records (CMORs), Treating Facilities or Subscribers.
  
  DG*5.3*505, MPIF*1.0*26, and MPIF*1*27 are required builds for
  patch MPIF*1*28.
   
  The enhancements introduced in patch MPIF*1*28 are outlined in the 
  MPI Changes Iteration 1 Software Design Document.
  
  1.)  Selected identifying fields in the PATIENT (#2) file must be
  asked early in the patient registration process, before the query
  to the Master Patient Index (MPI) system.  This allows these fields
  to be available to be used in an enhanced matching algorithm.  Code
  was added in routine MPIFAPI to accomplish this.  This Application
  Programmer Interface (API) is called by the following options.
      10-10T Registration  [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]
      Register a Patient  [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Load/Edit Patient Data  [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
  
  During registration of a new patient, the following fields are
  asked prior to the MPI query.
      MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME (#.2403)
      PLACE OF BIRTH [CITY] (#.092)
      PLACE OF BIRTH [STATE] (#.093)
      ALIAS (#1) subfile 2.01, (#.01)
  For an existing patient, the following additional fields must be
  verified prior to the MPI query.
      NAME (#.01)
      DATE OF BIRTH (#.03)
      SEX (#.02)
      SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09)
      MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994)
  
  2.)  With the introduction of the new Race and Ethnicity fields in the 
  Patient file (#2), in Patch DG*5.3*415, the remote procedure MPIF EXT
  PDAT REMOTE needed to be modified to utilize these new fields.  Routine
  MPIFEXT2 has been modified to support this change.
  
  3.)  A request was made to display the Integration Control Number (ICN) 
  and the Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) when an exact match is 
  found.  This will only happen when the ICN assignment is requested
  during an interactive option at the site (i.e. Load/Edit Patient Data or
  Single Patient Initialization).  This change has been made in routine
  MPIFQ0.
  
  4.)  With the move to the 2.4 standard Health Level Seven (HL7), the 
  check for 2.3 messaging is no longer needed.  References to
  $$SEND^RGJUSITE have been removed from routines MPIFQ0 and MPIFSAQ.
  
  5.)  Several new fields are being stored on the MPI as a result of this 
  project.  The following were requested to be returned in the Display Only
  Query option [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] and displayed during the
  action MPI Data View [MPI] on the List Manager screen for potential
  matches during the Single Patient Initialization option [MPIF IND MPI
  LOAD]: 
         ALIAS (multiple)
         MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR
         POW STATUS INDICATED?
  
  As a result of these new fields being added, a coding change was made to 
  no longer restrict on the number of Treating Facilities returned.  
  Routines MPIFQ1, MPIFSAQ, MPIFSA2, MPIFSA3, MPIFBT1, MPIFBT2, and MPIFQ3
  have been modified to support this change.
  
  6.)  As a result of NOIS SBY-0203-30078, the HL7 development team has 
  requested that we not kill the variable HL in our routines.  This has
  been corrected in MPIFA31B and MPIFA24B.  This doesn't address completely
  the problem detailed in NOIS SBY-0203-30078, that will be addressed by
  the HL7 application.
  
  7.)  Las Vegas reported via the Data Management team that they couldn't
  inactivate a patient because the patient was shared, but the patient 
  was not shared.  A comparison was being done between the station number
  and the internal entry number.  This has been corrected in MPIFDEL.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*28.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Inactivate Patient from MPI             [MPIF PAT INACT]
         Single Patient Initialization to MPI    [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]
         Display Only Query              [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] 
         Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
  
         10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
         Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
         Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
         Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
    
      
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
