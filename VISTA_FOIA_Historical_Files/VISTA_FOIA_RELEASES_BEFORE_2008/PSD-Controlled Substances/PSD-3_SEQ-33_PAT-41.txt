Subject: CONVERSION OF NARCOTICS MONITORING FILEMAN ROUTINES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The Office of the Medical Inspector, in collaboration with the Narcotics 
 Diversion Advisory Group, requested development of tools to support
 and monitor Pharmacy Service Schedule II narcotics inventory management
 to be distributed to all medical centers.  This enhancement includes
 a new standalone CS Monitoring Menu [PSD NM MENU] option containing reports
 derived from VA FileMan templates used during site visits that were found
 to be valuable in assisting sites with the monitoring of Schedule II narcotics
 prescriptions.  These reports also allow for the monitoring of controlled
 substance schedules C-II through C-V.
   
 This patch includes a new standalone menu option entitled CS Monitoring Menu
 [PSD NM MENU] option that will not be attached to a menu. IRM support
 personnel will need to assign the menu to the Narcotics Inspectors and
 Pharmacy Managers at the site.  
   
 Kernel's Option Access by user [XUOPTWHO] option will be attached to the
 CS Monitoring Menu [PSD NM MENU] option upon patch installation. The
 following new options are brought in with the menu:
   
      CS Application Security Key Report [PSD NM SECURITY KEY] option
      CS Balance Adjustments Report [PSD NM CS ADJ] option
      CS RXs by Same Person Report [PSD NM RX SAME PERSON] option
      Label Reprint for CS RXs Report [PSD NM RX REPRINT] option
      Partial Request for CS RXs Report [PSD NM RX PARTIAL] option
      Patients Without VA Visit Report [PSD NM RX WITHOUT VA] option

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ==========================
  Sites will retrieve VISTA documentation from the following FTP
  addresses.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
  available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation
  directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
  
  Albany            ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Hines             ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City    ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov      anonymous.software

  ==========================
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
  take less than 5 minutes.
   
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
   
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.

        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
