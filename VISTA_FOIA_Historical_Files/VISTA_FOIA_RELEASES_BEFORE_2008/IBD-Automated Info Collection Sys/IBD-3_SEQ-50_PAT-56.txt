Subject: IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When accesssing the IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY option to work the  
 previously defined Inactive codes on Encounter Forms by using the Replace 
 Code(RC),it appears to process the items on the list. When it returns to 
 refresh the displayed list, the data listed are not being updated and  
 refreshed correctly. Another issue was found where an invalid  prompt 
 " Term/Concept" appears that should not be there after selecting an entry 
 from the list. This prompt should be "Select ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE NUMBER".

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1.  MAD-1003-42483     MAINTENANCE UTILITY FOR ACTIVE/INACTIVE CODES
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the IBDF UTIL MAINTENANCE UTILITY, and selecting LM choice 
 F (to sort by FORMS), take default of ALL for select forms, then enter DG
 SELECT ICD-9 DIAGNOSIS CODES for the Select Type of Code to Display 
 Prompt, then LM choice I to display INACTIVE codes. Do RC and select from 
 the Number list. The process appears to work correctly until the screen is
 refreshed. The item picked should have been removed, at times it is not
 and the display is not as it was, minus the one worked, but shows a
 different set of codes to work. Also there are times when you will get an 
 invalid prompt "Enter Term/Concept:" when you should get "Select ICD 
 DIAGNOSIS CODE NUMBER:".
 
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The process has extensive use of Fileman and nested processes, in this 
 case it has an interface with the Clinical Lexicon and on the return 
 calls Fileman to set up for the next user interface but does not clear 
 the Fileman variables. Left over variables cause the process to get lost. 
 The code was changed to clean the variables after the Lexicon interface.
