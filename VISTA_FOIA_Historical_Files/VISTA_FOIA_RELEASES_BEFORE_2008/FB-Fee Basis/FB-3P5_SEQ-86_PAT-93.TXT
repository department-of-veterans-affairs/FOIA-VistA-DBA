  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has been designed to support the "Conversion of VISN 3 Class 
 III Radiology RVU Report To Class I" software. Fee Basis (FB) will be 
 providing to the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application an access point
 to Fee Basis data via the new private application programming interface 
 (API) $$RVU^FBRVU, described in Integration Agreement (IA) #4799. 
 The new API has been designed to retrieve Work Relative Value Units (RVU) 
 from Fee Basis CPT RVU file (#162.97) by passing a CPT code, CPT 
 Modifier(s) and a date as parameters.
  
 This patch will add a new field, NONPAYABLE (#.08) to the Fee Basis
 CPT RVU file (#162.97) data dictionary in order to mark those records 
 that cannot be used to calculate Fee Basis fees. The records with the 
 new field NONPAYABLE (#.08), set to 1 (Yes) will be used only by 
 $$RVU^FBRVU to serve Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application. Additional 
 code changes have been made in the Fee Basis software to prevent usage of 
 these records in the normal Fee Basis fees calculation process. Thus, only 
 those records with the NONPAYABLE (#.08) field set to null or 0 (No) 
 will be used by software to calculate Fee Basis fees. 
  
 In addition, this patch will update the Fee Basis CPT RVU file (#162.97) 
 with the non-payable RVU values for 1999-2005 that were not imported in 
 previous patches and new 2006 RVU data imported from Centers for Medicare
 and Medicaid Services (CMS) website, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/. The only 
 purpose of this update is to provide the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 
 application with the RVU values for years 1999-2006. This update will NOT 
 impact the Fee Basis calculation process, which still will be using 2005 
 schedule, since this patch will not update all necessary fields and files 
 to make it possible. It will be done in a separate patch when Department 
 Of Labor approves the new RVU values for 2006.
  
 The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the 
 FB global by approximately 4 MB....  If you are journaling ^FB, 
 please insure you have adequate journal space before installing.
  
 Since the patch contains modifications to the software that 
 calculates payments, installation of this patch will affect the menu 
 options used to enter or edit payments for the Medical Fee program 
 (outpatient) and ancillary payments for the Civil Hospital program.
