Subject: PROVIDER COMING UP AS INVALID PROVIDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When checking out a visit or entering a provider at the CPT level, the 
 site is receiving a "not a valid provider" message due to the NEW 
 PERSON file having another entry with the same name as the Provider. 
 This error message occurs when a duplicate named Provider is attempted 
 to default, but errors instead.  In the past the sites have been 
 correcting the problem by changing the name of one of the two 
 duplicate named entries involved by adding a middle initial.  
  
 The following is a screen example of the error condition for Provider
 named Test,Dr. There is also another entry in the New Person file entered 
 as Test,Dr who is a student.

 Enter PROVIDER associated with PROCEDURE: TEST,DR // 
                                         
                     The above NAME is not a VALID PROVIDER

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 MIN-1101-41673 Provider keeps coming up: Invalid Provider
  
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 When checking out a visit, and entering a provider, it is showing
 "not a valid provider".  The problem occurs when there is another
 entry in the NEW PERSON file with the same name as the Provider on
 record.  In the past the sites have been making one of the duplicates
 a different name by adding an initial to the name.  Support wanted
 a fix to the routine to prevent duplicate names from causing this error. 
  
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 This patch modifies the lookup logic to the NEW PERSON file to pass the 
 internal key when defaulting a previous provider and the user accepts the
 default value.  Modifications to allow provider with duplicate name in
 NEW PERSON to function properly when adding/editing Providers or Check Out
 action from Appointment Management template or PXCE Encounter Data Entry.
