Subject: Q1 ENHANCEMENTS & MISC. CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains the first quarter enhancements for the Outpatient
 Pharmacy V. 7.0 package. It provides the following updates to 
 functionality:
  
 1. The Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option is
 modified to provide the following functionality:
    a. It will print only the last 4 digits of the Social Security Number
       (SSN) instead of the full 9 digits.
    b. The Prescription status of "Suspended" will now print as
       "Active/Susp". This change is also shared with the Application
       Program Interface (API) number 1281, provided to Computerized
       Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 to return "Active/Susp" instead
       of "Suspended".
    c. As a result of the installation of patch PSO*7*233, if a bad address
       is indicated, "BAD ADDRESS INDICATED-" followed by the reason 
       ("UNDELIVERABLE", "HOMELESS", or "OTHER") was being printed. Once 
       PSO*7*258 is installed, "**BAD ADDRESS INDICATED**" will be printed
       but will not be followed by the reason.
  
 2. The Medication Profile [PSO P] option will now print the last 4 digits
 of the SSN instead of the full 9 digits.
  
 3. When finishing a pending order using the Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option or using the Complete Orders
 from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the following changes were
 made:
    a. The provider comments are displayed in the first screen. When the 
       following prompt is displayed:
  
       Copy Provider Comments into the Patient Instructions? No//
  
       the user has to scroll the screen up to know what the provider
       comments are. To avoid this problem, the provider comments are 
       displayed along with this prompt.
  
    b. A problem was reported with the calculated quantity for the drug
       Clozapine. A patient safety incident (PSI-06-146) was entered. The
       solution provided is as follows:
       If the drug has possible dosages defined, a quantity can be
       calculated. If this quantity is less than the quantity placed in
       CPRS, the calculated quantity will be displayed. Otherwise, the
       quantity placed in CPRS will be displayed. If there are no possible
       dosages defined then a quantity cannot be calculated and the message
       "Unable to calculate the quantity, enter a quantity" is displayed to
       the user in the ListMan message bar as a warning of a possible
       quantity issue. For Clozapine orders, since Outpatient Pharmacy
       might change the days supply and quantity placed in CPRS, the days
       supply and quantity have been added to the existing refill message.
       Here is an example of an order placed in CPRS with a days supply
       of 60 and a quantity of 60 for a patient eligible for 28 days 
       supply:
  
       (6)     Issue Date: OCT 26,2006        (7) Fill Date: OCT 27,2006
      Patient Eligible for 28 Day Sup. or 14 Day with 1 refill or 7 Day
      with 3 refill
       (8)    Days Supply: 28                (9)   QTY (TAB): 28
             Provider ordered 0 refills, days supply of 60 and a qty of 60
  
  
 4. After the release of patch PSO*7*233 some issues were identified and 
 are being corrected in this patch:
    a. If a hold reason of "8 (PER PATIENT REQUEST)" or "99 (OTHER--SEE
       COMMENTS)" was entered, the reason "7 (BAD ADDRESS)" was displayed.
       The reason is stored correctly, but this patch corrects the display
       in the following:
       1. "AL" action (activity log display) from within the patient
           profile
       2. View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option
    
    b. A potential problem was identified with a function call 
       ($$CHKRX^PSOBAI) that was not set up correctly. This code will
       probably never be used but this patch ensures that the function call
       will work appropriately.
