Subject: PART-TIME PHYSICIAN TIMEKEEPING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This enhancement patch adds new functionality related to part-time
 physicians that work adjustable hours and have signed a Memorandum of 
 Service Level Expectations.
  
 Part-time physicians that have a Memorandum of Service Level Expectations
 will record their work and leave on an Electronic Subsidiary Record (ESR). 
 When the Time and Attendance (T&A) Supervisor approves their ESR, the
 software will automatically post their timecard based on the hours recorded
 on their ESR. Under normal circumstances, the timekeeper will not post the
 timecard for these employees. 
  
 Part-time physicians with a memorandum will normally be paid the same 
 amount each pay period. The actual hours worked will be tracked within
 the VistA PAID software. When the memorandum ends, the hours worked,
 hours paid, non-pay hours and leave without pay hours will be compared to
 the agreed hours listed in the memorandum and any difference will be
 reconciled.

 The modifications made by this patch are briefly described below:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. HUMAN RESOURCES
    ---------------
    A new menu has been attached to the existing Employee Inquiry/Reports 
    Menu [PRSD 05 EMPLOYEE INQUIRY MENU]. A brief description of this new
    menu and the attached new options follow:
  
    PT Physician Menu [PRSP HR MAIN]
      This option will allow the Human Resources user to access a menu of
      options related to the processing of part-time physicians with 
      Memoranda of Service Level Expectations.
  
      1  Enter Memoranda [PRSP HR EM]
         This option allows Human Resources to enter Memoranda of Service 
         Level Expectations for part-time physicians.
  
      2  Terminate Memoranda [PRSP HR TM]
         This option allows Human Resources to terminate Memoranda of 
         Service Level Expectations for part-time physicians.
         
      3  Delete Future Memoranda [PRSP HR DFM]
         This option allows Human Resources to delete Memoranda of Service 
         Level Expectations for part-time physicians. The first pay period
         covered must either not be open or if opened, the part-time
         physician's timecard must be in the status of TIMEKEEPER.
  
      4  Begin Reconciliation Process [PRSP HR BRP]
         This option allows Human Resources to review part-time physician
         Memoranda and to begin its reconciliation.
  
      5  Reconcile Memoranda [PRSP HR RM]
         This option allows Human Resources to review part-time physicians 
         memoranda and to complete its reconciliation.
  
      6  Memoranda Report [PRSP HR MR]
         This option allows Human Resources to review a part-time 
         physician's memoranda.
  
      7  Memoranda Expiring Within Date Range [PRSP HR DEM]
         This option allows Human Resources to identify part-time physician
         memoranda that will expire within the specified date range, so
         they can initiate the appropriate paperwork to begin the memoranda
         renewal process.
  
      8  Display Pay Period ESR [PRSP HR DE]
         This option lets Human Resources review a part-time physician's 
         ESR for the selected pay period.
  
 2. EMPLOYEE
    --------
    A new menu has been attached to the existing Employee Menu [PRSA EMP 
    MENU]. The new menu will only be visible to employees that hold the
    PRSP EMP key. The software automatically assigns this key to an
    employee when Human Resources enters a Memorandum of Service Level 
    Expectations for them. A brief description of this new menu and the
    attached new options follow:
  
    PT Physician With Memorandum Menu [PRSP PTP MENU]
      This menu option contains a list of options to allow part-time
      physicians with Memoranda of Service Level Expectations to perform
      the necessary actions related to the tracking of their Time and
      Attendance.
  
      1  Electronic Subsidiary Record-Daily Enter/edit [PRSP ESR EDIT]
         The primary purpose of this option is to allow part-time
         physicians with a Memorandum of Service Level Expectations to
         record time and leave on their daily electronic subsidiary record
         (ESR). This option presents a list of pay periods for the
         part-time physician to select. Any pay period that appears in the
         selection list must have one or more days that are in a status
         that requires some action from the part-time physician.  Once a pay
         period is selected, the option presents a summary of the memorandum
         that contains the pay period and a summary of each day within that
         pay period. The physician can select any day in the pay period
         that is not yet approved. Once a day is selected, the option
         presents a form that allows the part-time physician to edit and
         electronically sign their time and leave for that day. 
         
         Secondarily, this option will also present the part-time physician
         with any recently ended memoranda. Any such memoranda will appear
         first in the selection list. If selected, the option allows the 
         part-time physician to review the memorandum and select a 
         reconciliation option. 
  
      2  Extended Absence ... [PRSP EA MENU]
         The menu contains options related to maintaining extended absence
         records.
  
         1  Enter Extended Absence [PRSP EA ENTER]
            This option allows a part-time physician to specify a future
            period of time when they will not be performing work for the
            VA (extended absence). The physician will not need to
            manually update their ESR during the absence. The software
            will automatically change the status of daily ESRs, with a
            scheduled tour of duty, to SIGNED, if those days are covered
            by the period of extended absence.
             
         2  Edit Extended Absence [PRSP EA EDIT]
            This option allows the part-time physician to edit a previously
            entered extended absence. The software will automatically 
            update the current and future days on the ESR as necessary.  
            However, any ESR days prior to the current day will not be
            automatically modified when an extended absence is edited. An
            extended absence can not be edited when the To Date is prior to
            the current day.
  
         3  Cancel Extended Absence [PRSP EA CANCEL]
            This option allows the part-time physician to cancel a 
            previously entered extended absence. The software will
            automatically update the current and future days on the ESR as
            necessary. However, any ESR days prior to the current day will
            not be automatically modified when an extended absence is
            cancelled. An extended absence can not be cancelled if its To
            Date is prior to the current day.
  
         4  Display Extended Absence [PRSP EA DISPLAY]
            This option allows a user to display a list of their extended
            absence records that end on or after a specified date.
  
      3  Display Pay Period ESR [PRSP PTP DE]
         This options allows the part-time physician to review their daily 
         ESR records for the selected pay period.
  
      4  Display Memoranda [PRSP PTP DM]
         This option allows the part-time physician to display all of the
         information related to their Memoranda of Service Level 
         Expectations.
  
      5  Select Reconciliation Choice [PRSP PTP SRC]
         This option allows the part-time physician to review a recently
         ended memorandum and to select a reconciliation option.
  
    Two existing employee leave options have been modified by the patch to
    behave slightly differently for part-time physicians with an active
    memorandum. These modified options are listed below:
  
      Cancel Leave Request [PRSA LV CAN]
         Approved leave is automatically posted to the ESR.  This option 
         was modified to remove such leave from the ESR when the employee
         cancels it.
  
      Edit Leave Request [PRSA LV EDIT]
         Approved leave is automatically posted to the ESR.  This option 
         was modified to remove such leave from the ESR when the leave is
         edited, since editing revokes the supervisor approval of the
         leave.
  
 3. TIMEKEEPER
    ----------
    A new menu has been attached to the existing Timekeeper Main Menu [PRSA
    TK MENU]. A brief description of this new menu and the attached options
    follow:
  
    PT Physician Menu [PRSP TK MAIN]
      This menu contains all of the options that Timekeepers will need to
      monitor and post timecards for part-time physicians with a Memorandum
      of Service Level Expectations.
  
    1  Post PT Physician Time [PRSP TK POST]
       This option allows the timekeeper to post timecard data for a 
       part-time physician that has a Memoranda of Service Level
       Expectations. This action should only be done at the direction of
       the T&L Supervisor when the physician's Electronic Subsidiary Record
       (ESR) can not be completed before timecard certification for the pay
       period. Unscheduled regular time (RG) will only be tracked via the
       ESR, and can not be posted to the timecard. The timekeeper is
       prompted for a date and whether or not to post the timecards in 
       alphabetical order.
  
    2  Display Pay Period ESR [PRSP TK DE]
       This option lets Timekeepers review a part-time physician's ESR for
       the selected pay period.
  
    3  Display PP ESR Exceptions [PRSP TK CPPE]
       This option allows timekeepers to review daily ESR exceptions for
       part-time physicians with Memoranda of Service Level Expectations.
  
    4  Memoranda Report [PRSP TK MR]
       This option lets timekeepers review a part-time physician's 
       memoranda.
  
    Two existing timekeeper options have been modified by the patch to
    behave slightly differently for part-time physicians with an active
    memorandum. These modified options are listed below:
  
    Post Employee Time [PRSA TK POST]
      This option was modified to prevent selection of a part-time 
      physician with an active memorandum.  The new Post PT Physician Time
      [PRSP TK POST] option must be used to post time for such employees.
  
    Enter/Edit Employee Tour of Duty [PRSA TK TOUR-EDIT]
      This option was modified to perform additional steps when a tour is
      changed for a part-time physician with an active memorandum. In 
      addition to the normal step of removing any timecard postings on the
      changed day, the software will also remove any postings from the ESR.
  
  
 4. SUPERVISOR
    ----------
    A new menu has been attached to the existing T&A Supervisor Menu [PRSA 
    SUP MENU]. A brief description of this new menu and the attached new
    options follow:
  
    PT Physician Menu [PRSP SUP MAIN]
      This menu contains all of the options that the Supervisors will need
      to monitor and maintain part-time physicians Memoranda of Service
      Level Expectations.
  
      1  Approve Signed ESRs [PRSP ESR SAP]
         A T&A Supervisor of a part-time physician is required to review
         and take one of the following actions on each signed day of the
         part-time physician's ESR: (A)pprove, (B)ypass or mark the ESR
         for (R)esubmission.  When the T&A Supervisor approves a signed
         daily ESR, this option attempts to update the part-time
         physician's timecard for that day. Updates to the timecard will
         be screened based on the status of the timecard and the effect of
         any potential update.
  
      2  Memoranda Report [PRSP SUP MR]
         This option lets supervisors review a part-time physician's 
         memoranda.
  
      3  Display PP ESR Exceptions [PRSP SUP CPPE]
         This option allows supervisors to review daily ESR exceptions for
         part-time physicians with Memoranda of Service Level Expectations.
  
      4  ESR Exceptions For Entire Memoranda [PRSP SUP EXCEPT]
         This option allows supervisors to identify any incomplete daily 
         ESRs that occurred during the part-time physician's memoranda.
  
      5  Display Pay Period ESR [PRSP SUP DE]
         This option allows the supervisor to review the part-time 
         physician's daily ESR record for the selected pay period.
  
      6  Unlock Daily ESR [PRSP SUP UNLOCK]
         This option allows supervisors to unlock prior Pay Period ESRs so
         the part-time physician can change or complete any incomplete
         daily ESRs.
  
    Two existing supervisor options have been modified by the patch to
    behave slightly different for part-time physicians with an active
    memorandum. These modified options are listed below:
  
    Supervisory Approvals [PRSA SUP CERT]
      This option was modified to automatically post an approved leave 
      request to the ESR in an open pay period, if the employee taking
      leave is a part-time physician with an active memorandum. If the
      leave can't be posted to the ESR, the leave request will remain
      unapproved, and the supervisor will be notified of the problem via
      e-mail.
  
    Pay Period Certification [PRSA SUP REV]
      This option was modified to review the part-time physician's ESR and
      to update the various categories of hours worked in the PT PHYSICIAN 
      MEMORANDUM (#458.7) file when the associated timecard is certified.
  
 5. PAYROLL
    -------
    A new menu has been attached to the existing Payroll Main Menu 
    [PRSA PAY MENU].  A brief description of this new menu and the attached
    new options follow:
  
    PT Physician Menu [PRSP PS MAIN]
      This menu contains all of the necessary options to allow Payroll to
      monitor the status of part-time physicians' Memoranda of Service
      Level Expectations.
  
      1  Memoranda Report [PRSP PS MR]
         This option allows Payroll to review all of the details related to
         a part-time physician's memoranda.
  
      2  Display Pay Period ESR [PRSP PS DE]
         This option allows Payroll to review a part-time physician's ESR
         record for the selected pay period.
  
      3  ESR Exceptions For Entire Memoranda [PRSP PS EXCEPT]
         This option allows Payroll to identify any incomplete daily ESRs
         that occurred during the part-time physician's memoranda.
  
    One existing payroll manager option has been modified by the patch to
    behave slightly different for part-time physicians with an active
    memorandum. The modified option is listed below:
  
    Open Next Pay Period [PRSA PP OPEN]
      This option was modified to initialize the ESR daily status and auto 
      post holidays, leave, and extended absences to the ESR for the new
      pay period. It will also update the status of the memorandum from
      NOT STARTED to ACTIVE, if the pay period being opened is the first
      pay period covered by the memorandum.
