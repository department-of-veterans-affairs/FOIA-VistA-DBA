Subject: SURGERY-TRACKING PROSTHESIS ITEMS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. The Surgery-Tracking Prosthesis Items project enhances the Surgery 
    software, adding new fields to the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED sub-file 
    (#130.01) in the SURGERY file (#130). These new fields will 
    function to mark the prosthesis item as sterile and record the 
    expiration date of the sterile implant. The information entered into 
    these fields will display on the Nurse Intraoperative Report. As an 
    added safety/quality measure, the new fields will be mandatory for 
    signing the Nurse Intraoperative Report. The report cannot be signed 
    until all documentation is completed.
  
 2. Unrelated to the Prosthesis features, the trigger event for 
    discontinuing orders will be moved from the TIME PAT OUT OR field
    (#.232) of the SURGERY file (#130) to the TIME PAT IN OR field (#.205)
    of the SURGERY file (#130). This enhancement is required as part of
    the Documenting Preoperative Antibiotics (Gainesville Solution)
    project.
  
 3. On the Nurse Intraoperative Report, replace references to CORRECT 
    SURGERY COMMENTS to TIME OUT VERIFIED COMMENTS, IMAGING CONFIRMED 
    COMMENTS, and MARKED SITE COMMENTS, as appropriate.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed with Surgery users off the system. It
 should be installed at a time when the Surgery Nightly Cleanup and Updates
 [SRTASK-NIGHT] option is not running. No options need to be placed out of 
 service. Installation should take less than three minutes.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  3. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*157):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.

       SR157UTL. This routine is deleted by the installation process.
       The pre-installation process deletes the existing data dictionary
       for TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232) and will be restored upon patch
       installation.
