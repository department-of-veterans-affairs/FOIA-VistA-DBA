Description:
============

 This patch deals with concerns brought up in a recent patient safety 
 issue - 'Signed Progress Note Showing as Unsigned' and in a recent
 ClearQuest about a potential problem of '$D(arg)#2 usage. This patch
 currently contains the following functionality:
  
   1) Using the List Manager interface, users can search for and update TIU
      documents that have been signed but their statuses display as
      unsigned.
  
   2) A daily task to search for any documents that have been signed 
      but statuses stay unsigned.  If a document is found, then
      a bulletin with subject "TIU SIGNED/UNSIGNED DOCUMENTS" will be sent
      to a mail group named "TIU SIGNED/UNSIGNED DOC" with the document
      number.
  
   3) A minor change in routine TIUPNAPI to prevent a potential problem of 
      '$D(arg)#2 usage.  The change is mainly the line '$D(DUZ)#2.  It is 
      modified to '($D(DUZ)#2) to catch the potential error when DUZ is not
      defined but its descendant nodes are. 
  
 Details for invoking the routines associated with this patch can be found
 in the post-installation instructions below.
  
  OPTION:  
  ======
  There are two new options being exported with this patch. 
  
  1) Signed/unsigned PN report and update [TIU SIGNED/UNSIGNED PN] 
     This option is attached to the TIU MAIN MENU MGR menu.
  
  2) Signed/unsigned PN daily search [TIU SIGNED PN UNSIGNED 
     STATUS]. This option will be scheduled to run every night, see post
     installation instructions below.

  Note:

  The following NOIS calls are related to the above PSI; however, this 
  patch does not provide a real fix to these calls, so they will need to be
  open until we find a solution for the problem.

  This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it should
  be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users.
  Installation of this patch should take less than 1 minute.
      
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
       
     2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in this 
        patch are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at 
        this time.  
      
     3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
        select the Installation menu.  
      
     4. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
        options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*180): 
      
        a.  Backup a Transport Global 
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global

  Post-Installation Instructions: 
  ==============================
  
 1. The report can be run using the new menu option, Signed/unsigned PN 
    report and update [TIU SIGNED/UNSIGNED PN].
  
    When running this option, the following recommendations are made:
  
   - Users may be on the system
  
   - The job should be run at a time that does not conflict with a system 
     backup
  
   - Processing times for this task will vary considerably, depending on
   the load on your system and the number of entries processed in the TIU
   DOCUMENT FILE (#8925). 
  
   The TIU signed/unsigned LM provides the following functions:
  
   BROWSE DOCUMENT  - If authorized, read only view of a selected document.
  
   DETAILED DISPLAY - If authorized, allows the user to view document 
                      details of a selected document.
  
   STATUS UPDATE    - Allows the user to update the status of a selected
                      TIU document. If the note does not require 
                      cosignature, the status will be updated to 
                      "completed". If the note requires cosignature 
                      and the cosigner has not signed it, the status will
                      be updated to "uncosigned".
  
 2. Run the daily search by scheduling the new option:"TIU SIGNED PN 
    UNSIGNED STATUS" to run every night at 23:59
