   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
    
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines)  
   and are prepared to begin extracts for FY2001 data.
   
   Please insure that the DSS Site Manager obtains a copy of this
   patch description.
   
            Warning: Do not attempt to install this     
                     patch until you have received     
                     specific approval from the local

   ****************************************************************
    
   Please note: 
   
   Patch ECX*3*33 is the FY2001 Update for DSS EXTRACTS v3.0.
   
   The software and documentation are available, as of November 30,
   2000.  Sites should ensure that all FY2000 extracts have been
   generated, transmitted to Austin, and processed in DSS.  After
   this has been accomplished, sites should contact the Help Desk
   at the Bedford Technical Services Office (BTSO) to request the
   KIDS Distribution file for ECX*3*33.  Call (781) 275-9175.
     
   The documentation is available on the following CIO Field Offices'
   ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories.  All sites are encouraged to use
   their FTP capability to obtain these files.  The documentation
   files can be used on a PC with the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser
   program.  The .PDF files are binary files so you must make sure,
   when using the file transfer mechanism, to move these files to
   your VISTA machines and/or PC's using the appropriate commands
   for binary file transfer.  Some commonly used transfer protocols
   may not transfer .PDF files intact.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with 
   DSS Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been
   completed.  
     
   If you are running the install interactively and not rebuilding user 
   menus, installation will take less than 10 minutes. 
     
   Note:  If you are not running the installation interactively and intend
          to allow KIDS to start the rebuild of user menus upon completion
          of the install, then please queue the install for a period of
          low system activity.
     
   No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
   more than once.
     
   1.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation Menu.
   
       a.  Select the Load a Distribution option.
       b.  At the "Enter a Host File:" prompt enter ECX_30_P33.KID.
      
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
      
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
      
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*33):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
      
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*33.
     
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
    
       Extract Manager's Options   [ECXMGR]
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
    
   8.  After successful installation of this patch, the following routine
       may be deleted:
