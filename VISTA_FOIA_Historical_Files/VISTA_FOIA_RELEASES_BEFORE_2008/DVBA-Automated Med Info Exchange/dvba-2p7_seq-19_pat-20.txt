Run Date: JUN 16, 1998                     Designation: DVBA*2.7*20
Package : DVBA - AUTOMATED MED INFO Priority: Mandatory

Associated patches: (v)DVBA*2.7*17 <<= must be installed BEFORE `DVBA*2.7*20'

Subject: FIX 7131 REQUEST ERROR & ADM REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Print Template

Description: 
============

   The routine modifications included in this patch have been made to 
   address issues raised in the following NOIS entries:
   
   CLE-0398-41817
   CON-0398-11916
   BRX-0398-12266
   OKL-0398-72757
   
   The first three NOIS entries describe an undefined variable (DVBDOC) 
   error which occurs when a Regional Office user is attempting to  
   generate a 7131 request in the Request for 7131 Information [DVBA 
   7131 INFORMATION REQUEST] option.  The error only occurs when the  
   user specifies a date range for the patient activity search which 
   covers only a SINGLE patient event (e.g., a single admission, a 
   single appointment, etc.). 
   
   Routine DVBAREG2 has been revised as follows:
   
      In subroutine SINGLE, the variable DVBDOC is set at line 
      SINGLE+14 just as it is defined at line DISPLAY+28^DVBAREG1.
     
   OKL-0398-72757 describes a problem in the Admission Review Report 
   [DVBA ADMISSION REVIEW] option.  In the Admission Review Report, only
   the first three letters of the station name were printing in the
   C-FOLD LOC column.  This may cause difficulty in distinguishing the
   various locations.  Print template DVBA ADMISSION REVIEW was revised
   to print the first six letters of the station name.

       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
