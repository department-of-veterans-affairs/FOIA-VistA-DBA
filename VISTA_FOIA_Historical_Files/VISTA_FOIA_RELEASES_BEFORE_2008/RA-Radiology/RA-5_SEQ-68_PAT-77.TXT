Subject: SUBSCRIPT ERROR, RVU REPORTING ISSUE, SCROLLING ISSUE, FEE BASIS RVU DATA ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 5 issues.
      
 #1  When the user attempts to display an alert in CPRS initial 
 Patient Selection, a subscript error is filed in the error trap.
      
 #2   In the new wRVU reporting software, certain CPT codes do not
 reflect correct workload credit.  *Special note - this is NOT 
 related to the 2007 wRVU being available from Fee Basis.
           
 #3   When displaying the Activity Log within View Exams by Case No.
 [RA VIEWCN] option, if there are more that two entries for 'Exam
 Activity', the excess activity scrolls out of view without a pause 
 or 'press return to continue'.
      
 #4  If the Fee Basis RVU data has not yet been released for the
 current calendar year,  all RVU reports will show zeros for any exams
 performed in the current calendar year.
      
 #5  At the end of the Scaled RVU reports, a listing of the scaling factors
 by imaging type is provided.  Currently, imaging types without a defined
 scaling factor default to a scaling factor of 1 but do not print in the 
 listing at the end of the reports.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW
 ======================
 Problem #1
 -------
 When a user attempts to display a Radiology alert notification in the 
 CPRS Patient Selection screen, a subscript error is filed in the error 
 trap.  This happens when an alert is opened/read elsewhere and the 
 data has not yet been updated in CPRS.  In other words, CPRS does 
 not know that the alert has been read and the accompanying TMP 
 global nodes have been deleted.    
           
 Resolution #1
 ----------
 A modification will be made to routine RAO7PC4 to sense the absence
 of the data variable causing the subscript error.  This will allow normal 
 logic flow to continue. 
         
 Problem #2
 -------
 When using the new RVU (Relative Value Unit) reporting software, no 
 RVU is being returned/utilized on some CPT codes.  
      
 Resolution #2
 ----------
 It has been determined that "G" codes recently converted to CPT codes do 
 not contain an RVU value for entries without CPT code modifiers.
 A modification will be made to the RVU reporting software to default a
 26 CPT modifier when calling the API RVU^FBRVU .This will ensure 
 that the appropriate RVU is returned.  It is only called if the RVU 
 value is 0 and the modifier is null.
           
 Problem #3
 -------
 When using View Exam by Case No. [RA VIEWCN] option, the 'Exam Activity' 
 scrolls out of view when displaying to the screen if there are more than 
 two lines of Exam Activity to be displayed.
      
 Resolution #3
 ----------
 A modification will be made in routine RAPROD1 to cause the display to 
 pause and ask 'Press Return to continue or "^" to exit:" to prevent exam 
 data from scrolling out of view.
      
 Problem #4
 -------
 Normally, a Fee Basis patch is released each year that contains the new RVU
 data for the current calendar year.  In some instances the needed data will 
 not be available for an unspecified amount of time into the new calendar 
 year.
      
 Resolution #4
 ----------
  Modifications will be made to the RVU reporting routines to sense whether
 the new RVU data is available from FEE BASIS and if not, will calculate the
 reports with the previous year's RVU data.  A note will also be placed in
 the  header of the reports to denote the use of a previous calendar year's 
 data. 
      
 Problem #5
 -------
 When listing the Work RVU Scaling factors, the following Scaled RVU reports
 do not print scaling factors for imaging types that do not contain an entry 
 in the IMAGING TYPE file (#79.2), SCALING FACTOR CY field (#200).
      
 Physician scaled wRVU Report by Imaging Type [RA WKLIPHY SWRVU ITYPE]
 Physician scaled wRVU Report by CPT [RA WKLIPHY SWRVU CPT]
 Procedure Scaled wRVU/CPT Report [RA PROC CPTSWRVU]
      
 Resolution #5
 ----------
 Modifications will be made to the Work RVU reporting routines to print 
 a default listing of each imaging type that does not have an entry in 
 the SCALING FACTORY CY field (#200) of the IMAGING TYPE file (#79.2)
 by showing that it has a default scaling factor of 1.
 Example:
 ULTRASOUND                        US             1.00 (default)
