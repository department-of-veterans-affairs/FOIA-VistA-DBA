Description:
============

 This patch will introduce the changes necessary to standardize the data 
 stored in the allergy package.  Standardized data is necessary for 
 inclusion in the Health Data Repository (HDR).
  
 In addition, this patch will introduce two new cross-references and a new 
 Application Programmer Interface (API) that will allow changes to 
 existing reactant terms to propagate through existing allergy entries in 
 the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (120.8).
  
 The GMR ALLERGIES file (120.82) and the SIGNS/SYMPTOMS file (120.83) are 
 being standardized.  As a result of standardization, sites will no longer 
 be allowed to add or edit entries in either of these files.  In 
 addition, users will no longer be able to add "free text" 
 signs/symptoms in the roll and scroll interface.  Free text reactions 
 will still be allowed, although highly discouraged, in the GUI interface 
 until v26 is released.  V26 of the GUI will remove the ability to add 
 free text reactions (signs/symptoms). The ability to add free text
 reactants was removed by a previous allergy patch.
  
 The data standardization team has reviewed existing local entries at the
 sites and has added those terms to the standardized version of files
 120.82 and 120.83 as appropriate.  Requests for new terms will be made via
 the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) process.  If approved, the new term
 will be sent to all sites for inclusion in file 120.82 or 120.83.  For
 more information on this process, see XXXXXXXXX.
  
 This patch includes a post-installation routine that will fix some minor 
 database issues that may be present due to local deletions of entries in 
 file 120.82 and/or 120.83.  When the post-installation is complete the 
 patch installer will receive a mail message.
  
 **NOTE: Patch OR*3*233 must be installed before this patch so that the GUI
 interface and the roll 'n' scroll interface consistently handle the entry
 of standardized allergy data.**
  
 **NOTE: Upon introduction of the standardized signs/symptoms, it's 
 possible that the "top ten" list of signs/symptoms may now have inactive 
 terms on it.  These terms will need to be replaced by active terms by 
 updating the allergy site parameters.  The users listed in the GMRA 
 REQUEST NEW REACTANT mail group will be notified if any changes are
 necessay to your existing top ten list. 
  
 API 
 === 
 A new application programming interface (API) is being added in this patch
 to allow updates to definitions of reactants to be propagated through
 existing allergies in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (120.8).
  
 UPDATE^GMRAUTL2(ENTRY,ING,CLASS)
  
 ENTRY is IEN;FILE REFERENCE^TEXT OF FILE ENTRY - For example 
 23;GMRD(120.82,^STRAWBERRIES
  
 ING - Array of ingredients in the format of ING("A",IEN in file 50.416) 
 for ingredients being added and ING("D",IEN in file 50.416) for 
 ingredients being deleted.
  
 CLASS - Array of drug classes in the format of CLASS("A",IEN in file 
 50.605) for classes being added and CLASS("D",IEN in file 50.605) for 
 those classes being deleted.
  
 See DBIA #4667 for complete details regarding this API.

 INSTALLATION                                         
 ============
 *************************************************************************
 NOTE: Patch OR*3*233 must be installed before this patch so that the GUI
 interface and the roll 'n' scroll interface consistently handle the entry
 of standardized allergy data.
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users entering allergy information during the 
 installation process.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes to 
 install, but could be longer depending on the number of entries in file 
 120.8 (PATIENT ALLERGIES).
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*23):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRA*4.0*23.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     you may respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
 9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
