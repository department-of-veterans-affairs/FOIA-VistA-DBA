 I. OVERVIEW
 
 This patch introduces changes to the Registration V.5.3 package in
 support of the VHA Directive 2003-048 National Patient Record Flags.
  
 This patch is the Registration portion of the Patient Record Flags (PRF)
 Phase II Project which is a joint effort of both the HDS and PIMS Team.
  
 This patch provides the requirement that all Patient Record Flag
 Assignments are linked to a Text Integration Utilities (TIU) Progress
 Note.
  
 This patch, DG*5.3*554, along with patches TIU*1*184 and USR*1*27, is 
 being released in a single KIDS software distribution.
 This patch only includes the informational portion of DG*5.3*554.
  
 Please refer to the "Software and Documentation Retrieval" and
 "Installation Instructions" sections of the TIU*1*184 patch description
 for the instructions on how to acquire, install, and implement the patch
 software.
  
 An additional patch, the CPRS GUI version 26 patch OR*3*215, is also being
 released to support the Patient Record Flags Phase II project.

 II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
 The following is an overview of the primary functionality that will be
 delivered in this patch.
  
 1. PATIENT RECORD FLAG MANAGEMENT
  
   The Record Flag Management [DGPF RECORD FLAG MANAGEMENT] option
   is being enhanced to provide the following functionality.
   
   a. When this patch is installed, automatic linking of the single 
      Category I (National) Record Flag named "BEHAVIORAL" to the 
      TIU National PRF Category I Progress Note Title will occur. 
      The current TIU National Category I Progress Note Title is:
        "PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I"
  
   b. A new user prompt has been added to the Add New Record Flag 
      [DGPF ADD FLAG] action and the Edit Record Flag [DGPF EDIT FLAG] 
      action List Manager user interface screens to associate (link) 
      a TIU PRF Category II Progress Note Title to a PRF Category II 
      (Local) Record Flag name.  The new prompt is as shown below: 
        "Enter the Progress Note Title:"
  
   c. Ability to display the linked TIU Progress Note Title of both a
      Category I (National) and Category II (Local) Record Flag.
      The Display Flag Detail [DGPF DISPLAY FLAG DETAIL] action has had 
      the following new detail line added for the screen display of 
      the Record Flag detail:
        "Progress Note Title: PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I"
  
  
 2. PATIENT RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENT
  
   The Record Flag Assignment [DGPF RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENT] option
   will now provide the following functionality to link a TIU Progress Note 
   to a patient's Record Flag Assignment History Action record.
  
   a. Ability for the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) module to 
      link or un-link a TIU Progress Note to a patient's Record Flag 
      Assignment History action record.  New Application Programmer 
      Interfaces (API's) have been created to enable this file processing.
  
   b. Ability to display the linked TIU Progress Note when viewing
      the patient's Record Flag Assignment History details.
      The Display Assignment Details [DGPF DISPLAY ASSIGNMENT DETAIL]
      action has had the following new detail line added to the 
      assignment history screen display:
        "Progress Note: PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I"
  
  
 3. DISPLAY OF ACTIVE PATIENT RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENTS
  
   a. The VistA Patient Lookup screen display of a patient's ACTIVE 
      Patient Record Flag Assignment detail, has been enhanced to 
      include the following new detail line to indicate whether or not
      the PRF Assignment action has been linked to a TIU Progress Note:
        "Progress Note Linked: YES or NO"
  
   
 4. PATIENT RECORD FLAG REPORTS
  
   Four (4) new PRF report options will be provided within the 
   Record Flag Reports Menu [DGPF RECORD FLAG REPORTS MENU].
  
   a. Assignment Action Not Linked Report
        [DGPF ACTION NOT LINKED REPORT]
      A report listing all patient assignment history records that
      are not linked to a TIU Progress Note.
  
   b. Patient Assignments Report
        [DGPF PATIENT ASSIGNMENT REPORT]
      A report listing all of a patient's PRF Assignments.
  
   c. Assignments Approved by Report
        [DGPF APPROVED BY REPORT]
      A report listing all assignments by the APPROVED BY person.
  
   d. Assignments by Principal Investigator Report
        [DGPF PRINCIPAL INVEST REPORT]
      A report listing all Research Flag type PRF Assignments for the 
      PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR person.
  
  
 5. NEW ACTION CODE FOR EDITING PATIENT RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENTS
  
   a. A new action code, "Entered in Error", can be selected when the 
      user is prompted to "Select an assignment action:" during the 
      Edit Flag Assignment [DGPF EDIT ASSIGNMENT] data entry action.
 
      The new prompt selection is as follows:
  
        Select one of the following:
          C    Continue Assignment
          I    Inactivate Assignment
          E    Entered in Error
  
   b. When the new action code "Entered in Error" is selected, the 
      user will be prompted to edit the assignment narrative and who 
      approved the change prior to filing the update.
  
   c. The edit assignment action code "Entered in Error" will not be
      presented as a selection for use by Category I (National) PRF
      Assignments until the patch install compliance date has been
      reached.  This will prevent a potential problem of PRF Phase I
      sites rejecting the "Entered in Error" action code shared from
      a site that has installed the PRF Phase II software.
      Category II (Local) PRF Assignments are not affected by this
      activation date.
  
  
 6. REDISPLAY OF SCREEN DETAIL PRIOR TO FILING
  
   a. The following data entry add and edit actions of the Record Flag
      Management Menu [DGPF RECORD FLAG MANAGEMENT MENU] option,
      have been enhanced to re-display all the current record data, 
      including all updates by the User, prior to filing the entry.
  
      [DGPF ADD FLAG]     Add New Record Flag
      [DGPF EDIT FLAG]    Edit Record Flag
  
   b. The following data entry add and edit actions of the Record Flag
      Assignment Menu [DGPF RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENT MENU] option,
      have been enhanced to re-display all the current record data, 
      including all updates by the User, prior to filing the entry.
  
      [DGPF ASSIGN FLAG]                   Assign Flag
      [DGPF EDIT ASSIGNMENT]               Edit Flag Assignment
      [DGPF CHANGE ASSIGNMENT OWNERSHIP]   Change Assignment Ownership
  
  
 7. Remedy Ticket HD105241:  PRF HL7 ERROR ENCOUNTERED
  
    Problem:
    =======
    The site has received a PRF HL7 ERROR ENCOUNTERED transmission error 
    bulletin from a non-medical center treating facility that indicates
    they could not process the transmitted Patient Record Flag assignment
    update.
  
    Resolution:
    ==========
    The validation of the patient's treating facilities used for sharing
    Category I PRF assignments has been enhanced to prevent transmission
    to a non-medical center treating facility.
