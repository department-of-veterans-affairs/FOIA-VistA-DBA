As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
"BLD",6063,1,2,0)
a new commercial data source is utilized to provide warning label 
"BLD",6063,1,3,0)
information. 
"BLD",6063,1,4,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,5,0)
A parameter was provided by patch PSS*1*87 to turn on the new warning
"BLD",6063,1,6,0)
label format. This is currently being used in association with printing
"BLD",6063,1,7,0)
laser labels. However, since not all Consolidated Mail Outpatient
"BLD",6063,1,8,0)
Pharmacy (CMOP) facilities are reprogrammed to receive the new format, a
"BLD",6063,1,9,0)
new parameter is being added for turning on the new warnings for CMOP. And
"BLD",6063,1,10,0)
another parameter is being added to turn on sending the new warnings to
"BLD",6063,1,11,0)
the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI). This is to 
"BLD",6063,1,12,0)
accommodate vendors who may need to make changes to receive the new 
"BLD",6063,1,13,0)
warnings.
"BLD",6063,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,15,0)
Currently the Bedford CMOP is the only CMOP not ready to receive the new
"BLD",6063,1,16,0)
format.
"BLD",6063,1,17,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,18,0)
Until the parameters are turned on, warning labels from the old RX CONSULT
"BLD",6063,1,19,0)
file (#54) are used. When they are turned on, warnings from the WARNING
"BLD",6063,1,20,0)
LABEL-ENGLISH (#50.625) or the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH (#50.626) file will
"BLD",6063,1,21,0)
be used. When the parameters are turned on, the "Do not transfer" warning
"BLD",6063,1,22,0)
label 20 from the old RX CONSULT file (#54) is automatically added, when
"BLD",6063,1,23,0)
applicable, during label printing, transmitting to CMOP, or sending to
"BLD",6063,1,24,0)
OPAI.
"BLD",6063,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,26,0)
Example warning labels for a drug when the warning source is set to "New":
"BLD",6063,1,27,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,28,0)
  Take medication on an empty stomach one hour before or two to the three 
"BLD",6063,1,29,0)
  hours after a meal unless otherwise directed by your doctor.
"BLD",6063,1,30,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,31,0)
  This drug may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery. Use care
"BLD",6063,1,32,0)
  until you become familiar with its effects.
"BLD",6063,1,33,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,34,0)
  CAUTION: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person
"BLD",6063,1,35,0)
  other than the patient for whom it was prescribed.
"BLD",6063,1,36,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,37,0)
 
"BLD",6063,1,38,0)
This patch is required by PSO*7*200 which will send the new warning label 
"BLD",6063,1,39,0)
text to OPAI and by PSX*2*54 which will send the new warning label text to
"BLD",6063,1,40,0)
CMOP.
"BLD",6063,1,41,0)
