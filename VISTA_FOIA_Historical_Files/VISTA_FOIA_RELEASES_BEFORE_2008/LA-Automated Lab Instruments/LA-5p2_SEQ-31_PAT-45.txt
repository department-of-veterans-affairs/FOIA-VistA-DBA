Subject: MISSING PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS ON MANIFEST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

  This patch will address a fix to printing of Lab shipping manifests.
  
  Problem: The patient demographics were not printing under certain
           conditions on the manifest when a new page was started.
           If a new page is started because of a change in shipping
           condition or container and the last patient on the previous
           and current page are the same, the patient demographics would
           not print on the current page.
  
  Solution: When there is a change in shipping condition or container then
            force the printing of the patient demographics.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  -------------------------
  The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes if menus are not
  rebuilt. If menus are rebuilt then install time on a heavily used system
  will be approximately 25 minutes. This patch can be installed when
  Laboratory users are on the system.
  
  However the following conditions apply:
  
     - Printing of a Laboratory shipping manifest should not be occurring.
       The option Print Shipping Manifest [LA7S MANIFEST PRINT] will be
       disabled during the install by the KIDS build.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
  NOTE: MailMan and KERNEL patches must be current on the target system to
        avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
  
  1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
  4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
  5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
      all routines have the correct checksums.
  
  6.  If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
      prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
      option at this time.  You may also compare the routine in your
      production account to the routine in the patch by using the 'Compare
      a Transport Global to Current System' option.  These options can
      both be found under the 'Installation' menu.
  
  7.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package 'LA*5.2*45'.  When prompted 'Want to
      DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//',
      choose 'NO'.
  
  8.  On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
  
  9.  Routine LA45 can be deleted after successful patch installation.
