 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD 183747 - Bugs in VADPT routines
   
 Problem:
 ========
 There are several VADPT routines that are calling ^%DTC and are not 
 properly cleaning up the variables. This can cause a task number to be
 overwritten. The best solution is to replace the ^%DTC calls with ^XLFDT
 calls.
   
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine VADATE,VADPT2,VADPT3,VADPT5 AND VADPT61 have been changed to use 
 NOW^XLFDT instead of NOW^%DTC.
   
 2) HD 160796 - Widow/Widower entry   bdj
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Widow/Widower entry should read Widowed. 
   
 Solution:
 =========
 Change MARITAL STATUS file (#11) NAME field (#.01) to read Widowed 
 instead of Widow/Widower.
  
 3) HD 164686 - Remove references to "HCFA-1500" in File 46 DD.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The name of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was
 changed to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
 INPATIENT CPT CODE file (#46) has references to HCFA-1500 and to 
 HCFA that need to be removed.
   
 Solution:
 ========= 
 Remove references to HCFA-1500 and to HCFA in 
 INPATIENT CPT CODE file (#46)
  
  
 4)HD 190654 - Patient Eligibility option does not display all 
                classifications
  
 Problem:
 =========
 Eligibility Inquiry for Patient Billing[DG PATIENT ELIGIBILITY INQUIRY] 
 screen does not display Environmental contaminants and N/T Radium, only 
 Agent Orange and Radiation Exposure.
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Routine DGRPDB has been changed to display Environmental contaminants and
 N/T Radium on the Eligibility Inquiry for Patient Billing[DG PATIENT 
 ELIGIBILITY INQUIRY] screen.
  
 5) HD 184558 - EN^VAFHLPID - corrupted maiden name
  
 Problem:
 =======
 The supported API EN^VAFHLPID does not properly encode the patient's 
 maiden name per the HL7 standard for PID-6 Maiden Name.
 Mother's maiden name is being taken straight from the PATIENT file( #2) 
 MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME field (#.2403) when building the PID.
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Routines VAFCPID and VAFHLPID have been modified to use the same API 
 ($$HLNAME^XLFNAME) used to encode the patient's name.
