Subject: WARD NAME CONVERSION PROCESS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

  
  1. Problem: In reference to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option,
     a functional discrepancy was discovered in the coding logic used to
     extract previous variance information stored in the BCMA MEDICATION
     VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  The report will only show variance
     information related to patients currently assigned to the selected
     ward.
  
     Corrective Action: Modifications were made to rebuild the data
     structure used to sort, store, and display the variance information
     related to all patients associated with the selected ward stored in
     the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).
  
  2. Problem: In reference to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option,
     several sites are experiencing problems with displaying variance
     information as a result of incompatible ward names stored in the
     BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  If the user selects a
     ward name from the WARD LOCATION file (#42) that does not match the
     ward name store in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78), the
     variance log information will not display on the report.
  
     Corrective Action:  The Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD 
     CONVERSION] option was added to the Bar Code Medication Administration
     Manager [PSB MGR] option to allow each site an opportunity to correct
     the sorting process used to display the ward name stored in their
     local BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  This option is
     temporary and it will be removed in Bar Code Medication Administration
     patch PSB*2*23.  The following functions are incorporated in the Ward
     Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option:
  
  a. Allow the user to select a specified date range to control the amount
     of time needed to complete the process and the amount of data that
     will be changed.
  
  b. Automatically, convert Ward Name to Ward internal entry number (IEN)
     if the Ward Name in BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) is
     identical to the Ward Name in the WARD LOCATION file (#42).
  
  c. Display a list of un-identifiable ward names to the user.
  
  d. If the conversion option finds data that needs to be addressed, it 
     will generate a MailMan message with the subject, "Change Ward Names -
     BCMA Variance Log File" to the user when the Ward Name Conversion
     Process is completed for the selected date range. This function is
     temporary and it will be removed in Bar Code Medication Administration
     patch PSB*2*14.

   Server Installation Instructions:
   =================================
  
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
   take less than 1 minute.
  
   **Recommendation**
  
   We recommend that each site backup the data in their
   BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  Each site needs
   to associate the proper ward names with the ward entries in their NURS
   LOCATION file (#211.4), before using the Ward Name Conversion Process
   [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option to convert the ward name to the ward
   internal entry number.  We recommend that you run this conversion 
   option for no longer than a 3 month span at a time.
  
  
     Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
     PC Client users should not be accessing the Client Software.
  
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.

        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSB*2.0*7)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSB*2.0*7.
  
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
        Install? YES//" respond NO.

     8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and

        completion.
