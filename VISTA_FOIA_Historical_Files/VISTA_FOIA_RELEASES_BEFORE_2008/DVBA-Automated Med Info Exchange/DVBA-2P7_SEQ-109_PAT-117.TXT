Subject: CAPRI GUI W/SECTION 508 CHANGES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 This patch has been released to announce an update to the CAPRI GUI
 executable.  This new GUI version provides updates for both VHA and VBA.  
 Most of the changes in this version of the GUI are to address
 Section 508 compliance deficiencies and to improve CAPRI's interaction
 with screen reading software, compatible with the Microsoft
 accessibility API's. 
  
 This version of the GUI should replace all previous versions and should 
 be provided to all administrative and clinical staff who deal with C&P
 exams.  In addition, some VSO's, research, and Blind Rehab (VIST) staff
 also use CAPRI at VHA sites and must be provided the update if they are on
 a previous version.

 REMEDY-TICKET OVERVIEW
 =======================
  
 The following VBA and/or VHA trouble tickets have been repaired in this 
 version of the CAPRI GUI:
  
 146233 - Can't upload large documents
 When a user created an extremely large document (40+ pages in many 
 cases), a timeout would occur on the signature screen.  The upload method 
 has been changed to send data in smaller packets, preventing a timeout.
  
 HD170514 - CAPRI- Exam Requests by Date Range report- not all 
 records show for same Start/Stop date report The CAPRI 'Exam Requests by
 Date Range' report does not show all the exams requested for a particular
 date range.  There is at least one record missing every time the report is
 run.
  
 GUI CHANGES
 ===========
  
 ***********************************************************************
 NOTE: Users who have partially complete templates (found on the C&P Worksheets
 Tab) should *not* experience any problems opening a template from the
 previous CAPRI version (DVBA*2.7*105) in this new CAPRI version.  If an
 unexpected problem happens, please submit a Remedy ticket for assistance.
 ***********************************************************************
  
 Requested Changes/Modifications:
 -----------------------------------
  
  
 1.Modifications have been made to GUI components to address Section 508 
   compliance deficiencies and to assure screen readers can be used to
   navigate CAPRI. Users who are not using screen reading software should
   not see any changes in the current functionality other than the
   additions noted in this Patch Description.
  
 2.Modifications have been made on the the signature verification
   screen, when signing a C&P worksheet, selection of an appointment or
   admission is no longer required. A checkbox titled "No appointment was
   necessary" is now available and can be selected to assist users with
   bypassing appointment selection.
  
 3.Modifications have been made to the 7131 Request Tab.  The 7131 requests
   function has been changed to no longer require a date when selecting 
   outpatient activity.  Users will need to select either the outpatient
   activity or admission radio button. When the Admission button is
   selected, a list of inpatient admission dates will be displayed for
   selection.  When the Outpatient button is selected, no additional
   selections will be required.  If outpatient is selected, O/P
   activity will be displayed under date of event on the 7131 Request Tab.
  
 4.Modifications have been added to the "Co-signature Transfer Utility" 
   to compensate for a change in the TIU header at some sites.  Once this 
   version is run, templates that previously were complete but not 
   identified as such by CAPRI, will now be accurately tagged in the
   utility.  Future changes to the TIU header should no longer break the
   utility.  These modifications will allow sites to transfer exams 
   cosigned in CPRS back into AMIE in order to release the Exam Request.  
   Sites that were experiencing a 'hang' during the check for cosignature 
   process will now be able to clean up the backlog of cosigned exams and 
   eliminate this hang.
