Subject: CANCELLED APTS STILL SHOWING UNDER DISPLAY CLINIC AVAILABILITY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the same issue which is occurring in two different
 options:  Cancel Clinic Availability and Display Clinic Availability Report.
 Both of these options will display/print cancelled appointments for a selected
 clinic when they should not.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD64338   PRE-CANCELLATION LIST
  
     Problem:
     --------
     A problem exists where a user goes into the option Cancel Clinic
     Availability and cancels a portion of a day.  If there were any
     patients with appointments during the period cancelled, those
     appointments are automatically cancelled.  If the user goes
     back into this option and selects the same clinic, the cancelled
     appointments will no longer display in the Pre-Cancellation List,
     which is correct.  However, if any of the patients had appointments
     rescheduled for a different clinic, but for the same date and time,
     those appointments will appear on the list, which is incorrect.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDC1 will be modified to check if the clinic pointer found
     in the "S" node of the patient file (# 2) for the applicable
     appointment date and time, is the same as the selected clinic.  If
     not, the appointment will no longer be displayed/printed.
  
  
 2)  HD86312   CANCELLED APTS STILL SHOWING UNDER DISPLAY CLINIC
               AVAILABILITY REPORT
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the Display Clinic Availability Report, the same logic
     problem that exists with problem #1 above, also exists with this
     report.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDCLAV0 will be modified to check if the clinic pointer found
     in the "S" node of the patient file (# 2) for the applicable
     appointment date and time, is the same as the selected clinic.  If
     not, the appointment will no longer print on this report.
