Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*111   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*131'

Subject: PRINTED MAR (MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION RECORDS) CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Currently the printed MAR does not show that an Inpatient Medication is
  on hold.  This patch will update the 14 day MAR, 7 day MAR, and 24 hour MAR
  reports to display "hold" on the report in place of the admin time.
  This change will affect the following options:
  PSJU 14D MAR - 14 Day MAR
  PSJU 7D MAR - 7 Day MAR
  PSJU 24H MAR - 24 Hour MAR
 
  Also, if an order is placed with an administration time between 0001 and 0059
  it is not displayed on the 24 hour MAR. Since the 24 hour MAR does not print
  00 as an administration time, administration times between 0001-0059 will be
  noted as "24" on the MAR.
 
  A site reported a problem with PRN medications not appearing on the 7 and
  14 day MAR reports. Specifically, orders with a schedule type of PRN were no
  longer printing after installing patch PSJ*5.0*111.  This patch will resolve
  this problem.
