Subject: ORRC*1*7 Dashboard Coexistence, JRE 1.4.2_12, 508

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  
 Associated patches: (v)ORRC*1*2    <<= must be installed BEFORE `ORRC*1*7'
                     (v)ORRC*1*3    <<= must be installed BEFORE `ORRC*1*7'
                     (v)ORRC*1*5    <<= must be installed BEFORE `ORRC*1*7
                     
 Note: The plugins from the prior patches need not be installed.
  
 This patch enhances the functionality of the Care Management application 
 by supporting the coexistence of the Clinician and the Nurse Dashboards.
  
 The patch also makes sure that the Care Management application launches 
 only with JRE1.4.2.12.  If this JRE version is not found, the application
 will display an error message to the user and not launch.
  
 NOTE: You do not need to uninstall any other JRE versions that are
       installed on the client.
  
 In support of Section 508 Standards, Subpart B, 1194.21, paragraph (i),
 a theme choice for users with limited color perception is also included 
 in this patch.
  
 In addition, this patch introduces several fixes to enhance the 508
 compliance of the Care Management application.
  
  
 Known Issue - Disappearing links
 ================================
 Due to JRE1.4.2_12, the text of many links becomes "whited out" after
 clicking once. A dotted box is displayed to show the location of the
 link and links are still usable. 
  
 This issue is related to the version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE);
 it occurs in all versions of JRE1.4.2 that are higher than JRE1.4.2_01.
 JRE 1.4.2_01 with which the application was originally tested, didn t
 have a links problem, but had several other problems. After careful
 analysis, it was found that each JRE had its pros and cons, but
 JRE1.4.2_12 was the most compatible version. The links issue was
 classified as a low priority issue compared to the other issues.
  
 Remediation 
  
 After you click a link, sometimes the link text disappears, and a
 dotted box is displayed. You can still click on the box to invoke the
 link. Also you may click in the pane that contains the link to restore
 the text.
  
  
 Dashboard Coexistence:
 ======================
 This allows the users to work in the Clinician and Nurse Dashboards 
 at the same time.
  
 During the testing of Care Management's original release, there were 
 issues identified when a user navigated from a Clinician Dashboard to the
 Nurse Dashboard and vice versa. At that time, it was recommended not to 
 include both the Clinician Dashboard and the Nurse Dashboard as 
 concurrent perspectives. The options that supported assignment of these
 perspectives were removed from the nationally distributed software.
  
 The patch introduces the following three options for the dashboard
 coexistence:
  
  1. ORRCMM CM ALL has been added. This gives access to the Clinician
  Dashboard, Nurse Dashboard, SignList and QueryTool perspectives.
  
  2. ORRCMM CLINICIAN NURSE has been added. This provides access to the
  Clinician Dashboard, Nurse Dashboard, and SignList perspectives.
  
  3. ORRCMM TROUBLESHOOTER has been added. This provides access to 
  the Clinician Dashboard, Nurse Dashboard, SignList, QueryTool and RPC 
  Logger perspectives. 
  Typically, this should be used by IRM personnel only, for troubleshooting
  purposes.
  
 This patch fixes the following issues when both the Clinician and Nurse 
 perspectives are assigned using the above three options:
  
  1.  Dashboard Refresh: When you switch from one dashboard to the other,
  the "headlights" do NOT get updated correctly.
  
  2. List Update: The list criteria changes do not reflect when you switch
  to the other dashboard.
  
  3. List Persistence: The lists are loaded when the Desktop starts and the
  lists are saved when the desktop is shut down. This is related to #2 
  above. It is not certain which list gets persisted, the modified one or
  the original.
  
  4. If a list is added or deleted in one Dashboard perspective, the 
  patient  lists in the other dashboard do not stay in sync.
  
 Launch with JRE1.4.2_12
 =======================
 Care Management has seen many Remedy tickets that are related to the JRE
 version on the client.  After detailed analysis it was concluded that the
 JRE1.4.2_12 is the most compatible version.  To fix this, the application
 launcher, HealtheVetDesktop.exe, has been modified to ensure that the
 application launches only with JRE1.4.2_12.
 The launcher will now search the registry for JRE1.4.2_12. If JRE 1.4.2_12
 is not found, an error message will be shown that the required JRE was not
 found and the user should contact the system administrator.
  
 NOTE: You do not need to uninstall any other JRE versions that are
       installed on the client.
  
 OTHER BUGS FIXED
 ================
 1. The List Editor popup is slow when the number of lists increase.
  
 2. The selected element in the patient list has the same foreground or 
    background colors as a non-selected element.
  
 3. Empty PRF popups are not displayed for the patients who do not have
    PRFs.
  
 4. The application logging was broken since the original release.
  
 5. The repackaging of the VistALink 1.5 caused the Desktop logging 
    functionality to fail for VistALink logging.  This has been fixed and
    now sites can enable logging when required for debugging purposes by
    including the following line in the config.settings file:
  
 Foundations Logger Value=DEBUG
  
 6. Logging functionality has been provided for an additional package, as 
    requested by the VistALink team.  To enable this logging, when required
    for debugging purposes, sites should include the following line in the
    config.settings file:
  
 Network Logger Value=DEBUG
  
 7. The version of the client can now be checked by looking at the
    version field of the plug-in named "CareManagement Client."
  
 8. If there is a client-server mismatch, there will be a popup error
    message and the application will not start.
  
 9. An intermittent error with ORWUDT failure was found during SQA
    testing.  The timeout for the synchronous RPC calls was increased from
    30 seconds to 5 minutes to handle this.
  
 508
 ====
 Theme change:
 A 508-compliance feature for those with limited color perception is 
 enabled by providing a theme choice alternative that uses symbols in the
 patient list to convey information that is otherwise conveyed via
 headlight color.  For example, a blue round headlight that conveys the
 meaning of "normal" may be indistinguishable from a grey round headlight
 that conveys the meaning of "normal acknowledged."  The alternative theme
 uses "X" and a checkmark, respectively, to convey these meanings.
  
 Following are the symbols and their meanings:
  
         *               Critical
         X               Normal
         checkmark       Normal Acknowledged
         
 This new theme is called Current Windows Theme.  The default is the
 HealtheVet Desktop theme.  The desired theme can be selected from the
 Tools -> Options -> Desktop.
  
 Other 508 fixes:
  This patch addresses the following 508 issues in the Dashboard Patient 
  list panel and the Patient list selector menu:
  
 1. Readability: JAWS announces the table coordinates but does not read the
    cell contents of, for example, Patient Name. 
    JAWS now reads the column heading and all cell contents including the
    Patient Name.
  
 2. Headlights: JAWS announces the table coordinates but does not read the
    cell contents for information that is conveyed by headlight color and
    hover tips.
    JAWS now conveys both criticality (formerly conveyed by headlight 
    color exclusively) and tooltip content (formerly conveyed by hover tips
    exclusively).
   a.Criticality for Task is announced as "High Priority" when the 
   headlight is red.
   b.Tooltip content for all columns announces the number of items 
   along with the column-name/item-type.
  
  3. Empty Cells: Empty cells should be announced as empty.
     JAWS formerly did not acknowledge an empty cell but now announces 
     the number of items as zero, along with the column-name/item-type.
  
  4. NumberOfEntries: Reader should announce number of table items/rows;
     number of Results, Tasks, Events, SignItems.
     When the cell holding the patient name has the focus, JAWS now
     announces the sequence of the patient along with the total number of
     patients in the list.  For example, in a list of 40 patients loaded in
     the table where the 4th Patient Name in the list has the focus, JAWS
     will include in its announcement "4 of 40."
  
  5. JAWSAnnouncements: JAWS does not announce the availability of Patient
     List selector or that Alt+P selects it.
     JAWS now announces:
     - "Patient List Selector is now selected.  Upon leaving, use Alt P 
     to return."
   - The selected Patient List in the context of a Combo Box object-the
     Patient List Selector.
   - The sequence number of the Patient List in focus along with the number
     of Patient Lists in the object.  For example, in a list of 9 Patient
     Lists available for selection in the Patient List Selector where the 
     2nd Patient List has the focus, JAWS will include in its announcement
     "2 of 9."
  Please note that the Patient List Selector only gets the focus the first
  time the user enters each Dashboard.  Otherwise, focus is acquired using
  Alt+P as announced.
   
  6. Readability of the Sensitive Patient Dialog: The "sensitive patient"
     dialog is not perceived by the reader in the Dashboard. 
     Jaws can now traverse the dialog by tabs and reads the "Restricted
     Record dialog" on the dashboard.  The default button for the initial
     focus is still on the "NO" button, to avoid any erroneous access of
     the record.

  Java Plugins Install
  ====================
   1. Unzip the file ORRC_1_7.ZIP into the HEVD directory on the Healthevet
      server.
  
      If prompted with: This folder already contains a file named
                          'client/HealtheVetDesktop.exe'.
                          Would you like to replace the existing file?
                             Reply Yes to All
  
      NOTE: When unzipping, regardless of the application used to unzip,
            please be sure that the application is set to use folder names
            so that the files included in the zip are extracted to the
            appropriate folders.
  
   2. Unzipping the ORRC_1_7.ZIP file into the HEVD directory will:
            a. Install the plug-ins in the plugins directory
            b. Place files named config_1.7.0.xml and testconfig_1.7.0.xml
               in the HEVD root directory
            c. Replace the previous example.settings file with the new
               example.settings file in the HEVD root directory.
  
    3. Delete the config_old.xml and testconfig_old.xml files from the HEVD
       directory if they currently exist.
  
    4. To make the plug-ins active, rename the current configuration xml
       file; e.g., rename config.xml file to config_old.xml and rename
       the config_1.7.0.xml file to config.xml.
  
       NOTE: If you are installing the plug-ins into a test environment
             rename the current testconfig.xml file to testconfig_old.xml
             and rename the testconfig_1.7.0.xml to testconfig.xml.
  
    5. There is no need to modify the configuration settings file; e.g.,
       config.settings, for proper installation of this patch.
  
    6. The launch file HealtheVetDesktop.exe has been updated with this
       patch.  You will need to replace the existing HealtheVetDesktop.exe
       on each client with the new one.  Please refer to the Install Guide
       for the manual or autoinstall process.
       If you used autoinstall in the past, you should move the following
       dictionaries on the HeVD server under a backup directory before
       using the auto install distributed with this patch:
             applications/
             utl/
             etc/
             etc/cminstall.bat
             construct.bat
             doc/
  
    7. This version of the HealtheVetDesktop.exe requires JRE1.4.2_12.
       You may get this from the Sun website, as described in the manual 
       install section.  If you are using the autoinstall, the script will
       install the JRE for you.
       
 NOTE: You do not need to uninstall any other JRE versions that are
       installed on the client.
  
    8. When you are satisfied with the functionality continued in this 
       patch, you may delete the old configuration xml files
       (config_old.xml) created in #4 and backup directory created in #6.
  
  AutoInstall
  ============
  The instructions for this install are inside the ORRC_AUTOINSTALL_1_7.ZIP
  in the file named 'doc/Care Management Install Script'.  The automated
  install instructions can also be found in the installation guide
  ORRCIG.pdf.
