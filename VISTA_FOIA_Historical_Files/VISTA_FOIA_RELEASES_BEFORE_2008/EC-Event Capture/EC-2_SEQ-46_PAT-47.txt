 *************************************************************************
   
   This patch supports Code Set Versioning, mandated under the Health
   Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  It contains
   routines, data, and data dictionary changes to recognize code sets for
   the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Health Care Financing
   Administration (HCFA) Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). When
   implemented, applications will be able to retrieve appropriate CPT
   and HCPCS codes based upon a date that a clinical event occurred.
  
   This patch is contained in the MULTIPLE BUILD DISTRIBUTION: CSV MS 1.0
 
   Installing the CSV MS 1.0 build provides all of the updates listed 
   below.  Sites will use the Multi-Build Distribution to ensure the 
   proper order of installation for the VISTA Packages in the Management 
   Systems Product Line.

 I.  BACKGROUND
 
 The Director of Information Assurance, requested modifications to the VHA 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) Patient Information 
 Management System (PIMS) package to allow the use of multiple versions of 
 code sets employed in financial transactions. The Health Insurance 
 Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulates that diagnostic and 
 procedure codes used for billing purposes must be the codes that were 
 applicable at the time the service was provided.  This initiative is commonly 
 referred to as the Code Set Versioning (CSV) project.  For this project, 
 four code sets required by HIPAA legislation are date sensitive and needed 
 modification. These include:
  o *International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modifications 
    (ICD-9-CM),
  o Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) Codes, which is part of the ICD-9 
    code set,
  o Clinical Procedure Terminology-4 (CPT-4), and
  o Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System (HCPCS) Level II Codes.
 
 
 This patch addresses the changes done within the Event Capture package 
 in compliance with the CSV project.  Modifications were done within
 the Event Capture application to assure the validity of CPT codes, CPT 
 modifiers, and ICD diagnosis for a given event date by utilizing standard 
 CPT and ICD APIs. 
 
  
 II. TECHNICAL
 
 o  All existing routines using the CPT APIs were modified to use the API 
    along with the Event Capture Procedure Date where applicable.
 o  Routines accessing the CPT and CPT modifier globals directly or through 
    Fileman calls were changed to use the CPT APIs along with the Event 
    Capture Procedure Date where applicable.
 o  Routines accessing the diagnosis global directly or through Fileman 
    calls were changed to use the new ICD APIs along with the Event Capture 
    Procedure Date where applicable.
 o  The EC NATIONAL PATIENT file (#721), PRIMARY ICD-9 CODE field (#20) was
    modified to use the ICD API for its field screening.
 o  The EC NATIONAL PATIENT file (#721.038), SECONDARY ICD-9 CODE field
    (#.01) was modified to use the ICD API for its field screening.
 o  The EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file (#725), CPT field (#4) was modified to 
    use the CPT API for its field screening.
 o  Routines ECPROV4 and ECPROV5 logic were incorporated into ECPROV3.  These 
    routines will be deleted at sites by this patch.
 o  DBIA1995-A, DBIA1995-B and DBIA3990 grant ECS the uses of the APIs.
   
    
 III. FUNCTIONAL
 
 Users will see no noticeable differences in the screen prompts but rather in 
 the display of CPT procedure codes, modifiers and diagnosis codes.  These 
 codes will now be displayed based on the patient procedure date and the 
 active/inactive status of the respective code.
 
 The following options are affected by the CSV functionality.

 MISCCELLANEOUS FIX
 ------------------
 While testing the EC GUI reports for the CSV project, it was discovered 
 that previewing a report on occasions would produce no results.  This 
 was being caused as a result of the open device being closed prematurely.  
 This problem was corrected in this patch.
