Description:
============

 *** This patch addresses Patient Safety Issue (PSI) - PSI-06-091 ***
  
 Duplicate SIG's are being placed on the NTE|7 segment of the 
 Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) transmission. This causes 
 the prescription to be rejected by the CMOP and not dispensed. This is
 delaying the filling of the patient's Outpatient Medications. The problem
 is caused when the patient's OTHER LANGUAGE PREFERENCE field (#106) from
 the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is set to Yes, but the patient's PMI 
 LANGUAGE PREFERENCE field (#106.1) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is
 not set to Spanish. This patch will require both to be set before sending 
 the SIG in both English and Spanish. The issue arose because if the 
 Spanish translations are not set up for a site, the "Spanish" SIG will 
 look very much like the English SIG and CMOP expects to receive the 
 SIG in both languages if the patient's preference is Spanish.
  
 Non-PSI changes in this patch:
 ------------------------------
 As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
 a new commercial data source is utilized to provide warning label source
 information. The new warning labels are enabled for printing on the laser 
 labels when the WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM
 file (#59.7) is set to "N" for "New". Parameters for using the new 
 warning labels are set using the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS 
 EDIT] option.
  
 For the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) to utilize the new 
 warning labels, this patch uses a new CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE field 
 (#16.1) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7), also set by using the 
 Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT] option. This should be set
 to "N" for "New" to send the new warnings to CMOP. This field is added by 
 patch PSS*1*120.
  
  
 If the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR field (#.121) in the PATIENT file (#2) is set
 and there is no active temporary address for the patient, the fill will
 appear on the CMOP reject log and will remain in suspense, but unmarked
 for CMOP. It will print when the local print from suspense is done to be 
 filled locally.
  
  
 **************** NOTE ***************************************************
 As the CMOP side also had to make programming changes, verify that the
 CMOP that your site sends to can receive the new warning label format.
 Then after setting the CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16.1) to "New",
 send a small batch and verify that it was received and able to be
 processed successfully. (As of the release of this patch, only the Bedford
 CMOP was not yet ready to receive the new format).
 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch adds the sending of the INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER field 
 (#991.01) from the PATIENT file (#2) if it is a national number. This 
 number is concatenated with the letter "V" and the ICN CHECKSUM field
 (#991.02) from the PATIENT file (#2) and is sent as the 18th subscript of
 the PID segment. (See example under item 1 below).
  
  
 When the CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE is "New", the format and/or content of
 the following segments will be changed:
  
 1. For the Patient Identification (PID) segment, the Patient Medication
 Instruction (PMI) preference will be sent as "ENG" for English or "SPA"
 for Spanish instead of the current numeric values.
  
     Example:
  PID|||000007890^1^M11||OPPATIENT^ONE||||||12345 S MAIN ST^ADDRESS
  LINE2^MADISON ^WI^53705||(000)555-1212|SPA|||1011007381V739824
     
 2. Currently, the first part of the English language medication 
 instruction (SIG) is sent in the RX1 segment and continuations are sent in
 NTE|7 segments. If a patient has a Spanish language preference, the SIG is
 sent to the CMOP in both English and Spanish. Additional fields added to
 the NTE|7| segment when the new warning source flag is set are:
  
 NTE|7|RX NUMBER|LANGUAGE CODE|NUMBER|TEXT  (TEXT is up to 100 characters 
 per NTE|7| segment) 
 Where: 
        RX NUMBER is the external prescription number from the PRESCRIPTION
          file (#52). 
        LANGUAGE CODE will be "ENG" for English or "SPA" for Spanish. 
        NUMBER is a sequence number for the SIG lines starting at 1 for
          each different language code.
  
    Example:
  
 RX1|500-300993-1|||||||||||90||D0132^DOXEPIN HCL 25MG CAP^L|||||11|
 20061122|11| ||20071123|20061122|300993||||TAKE TWO CAPSULES MOUTH THREE
 TIMES A DAY FOR 7 D AYS, THEN TAKE ONE CAPSULE
 NTE|7|300993|ENG|1|TWICE A DAY FOR 7 DAYS, THEN TAKE ONE CAPSULE AT 
 BEDTIME FOR 7 DAYS, THEN TAKE
 NTE|7|300993|ENG|2|ONE CAPSULE EVERY OTHER DAY FOR 7 DAYS 
 NTE|7|300993|SPA|1|TAKE DOS CAPSULES MOUTH THREE TIMES A DAY PARA 7 DIAS, 
 THEN TAKE UNO CAPSULE
 NTE|7|300993|SPA|2|TWICE A DAY PARA 7 DIAS, THEN TAKE UNO CAPSULE AT 
 BEDTIME PARA 7 DIAS, THEN
 NTE|7|300993|SPA|3|TAKE UNO CAPSULE EVERY OTHER DAY PARA 7 DIAS
  
  
 3. Instead of sending warning label numbers in the ZX1 segment, the 
 warning label text will be sent in the new NTE|11|segments.
  
 Note: A maximum of 5 warning labels can be printed, so only the first 5 
 for a drug will be sent to CMOP. If the patient has a PMI Language 
 Preference other than English, the first 5 warning labels in each 
 language will be sent. If the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG 
 file (#50) begins with numbers 1,2,3,4, or 5, the NO TRANSFER warning 
 text from the RX CONSULT file (#54) entry number 20 will be sent as one 
 of the first 5 warnings.
  
 The fields for the new warning labels are: 
 NTE|11|RX NUMBER|LANGUAGE CODE|RECORD NUMBER|WARNING LABEL TEXT
 Where: 
        RX NUMBER is the external prescription number from the  
          PRESCRIPTION file (#52). 
        LANGUAGE CODE will be "ENG" for English or "SPA" for Spanish. 
        RECORD NUMBER is either the internal entry number from the RX 
          CONSULT file (#54) or the internal entry number from the WARNING
          LABEL-ENGLISH file (#50.625) followed by an "N" when the LANGUAGE
          CODE is "ENG" or the internal entry number from the WARNING
          LABEL-SPANISH file (#50.626) followed by an "N" when the LANGUAGE
          CODE is "SPA". 
        WARNING LABEL TEXT is the complete text of the specified warning 
          number (maximum length is 200 characters). 
    
    Example: 
 ZX1|300993|514^TROY|M|1|(1of12)|OPPROVIDER,ONE|1|(***/***)|20061122|1|1|

 Also included in this patch is a fix for several Remedy tickets regarding 
 a null subscript when a prescription was discontinued during transmission.
 If the prescription was discontinued, the CMOP TRANSMISSION file (#550.2)
 reference for that prescription is cleaned up.
  
 Also added to this patch is the check for the value of the PROJ 112/SHAD
 field (#122.01) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) as an additional
 Environmental Indicator check to determine whether to send a copay or no 
 copay indicator to CMOP. The patch that creates this new field, PSO*7*225,
 will be released along with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 GUI27. The added check in this patch will have no effect until PSO*7*225 
 is installed.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system, but transmissions
 should not be in progress. Installation will take less than 1 minute.
 There are no other scheduling restrictions or recommendations.
   
  1.  Sites typically use nightly tasks that send controlled substances and
      non-controlled substances prescription transmissions to their CMOP 
      hosts. Unschedule all CMOP automatic transmissions by using the CMOP
      options:
   
         Setup Auto-transmission [PSXR AUTO TRANSMIT]
         Setup CS Auto-transmission [PSXR AUTO TRANSMIT CS]
    
  2.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSX*2.0*54):
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
      DDs, templates, etc.).
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
      components of the KIDS build.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSX*2.0*54.
   
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//" respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8.  Sites typically use nightly tasks that send controlled substances and
      non-controlled substances prescription transmissions to their CMOP 
      hosts. Re-schedule the CMOP automatic transmissions for controlled
      substances and non-controlled substances nightly tasks, as 
      appropriate for your site, by using the CMOP options:
   
         Setup Auto-transmission [PSXR AUTO TRANSMIT]
         Setup CS Auto-transmission [PSXR AUTO TRANSMIT CS]
  
  9.  When turning on the parameter to send the new warning label 
      format to CMOP, send a small batch at first and verify with the CMOP
      that the batch was received and able to be processed successfully. At
      the time of the release of this patch, only the Bedford CMOP is not
      ready to receive the new warning label format, so the parameter
      should not be turned on yet if your site sends to the Bedford CMOP.
