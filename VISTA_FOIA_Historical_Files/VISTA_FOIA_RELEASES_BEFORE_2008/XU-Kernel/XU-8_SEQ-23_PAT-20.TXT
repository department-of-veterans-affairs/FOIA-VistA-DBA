Description: 
============

  
  NOIS  DAY-0196-40185  If the listing of Unsuccessful Tasks was queued to
  a printer it would cause a extra blank page on the printer.
  
  NOIS  NAS-1295-30824  Entering a ^ to exit from a listing of tasks being
  requeued would cause an UNDEF error.
  
  MSG# 18395346 From Dave Alexander.  If in the Delete tasks option a "^" 
  wouldn't stop the listing.
  
  MSG# 19794130 From Dave Alexander.  This message asked for EN^XUTMDEVQ 
  to not new POP so that the calling routine can check the status. 
   
  A long standing requests to display more info on running tasks that have
  deleted there entry in the %ZTSK global.
  
  NOIS CLE-1195-40343      In the "Grant Access by Profile" option. The 
  deletion of Keys, Files and Secondary options didn't work. If this
  option was run twice in a row it would not use the new template user.
  This would only happen if the job wasn't queued. This has been fixed.
 
  NOIS BUT-1295-20458  BOS-0496-10026
  In the "Grant Access by Profile" option. Secondary
  Menu items that were in common with current secondary menu items would
  get duplicated.  This has been fixed be adding a "B" X-ref to the
  Secondary Menu subfile.  A post init will re-index this new X-ref on
  current entries.  The adding of this B X-ref made it necessary to make
  changes to other XQ routines that loop through the secondary menu list.
  
  NOIS --- The entry point EN^XQH leaves the variable XQH behind. This can
  cause problems if the user goes back into XQH.  The change kills XQH at
  the exit from the EN^XQH call.
  
  MSG# 19316051  It has been pointed out that files 4 and 49 are missing
  the data type flag from the second piece of the .01 field.  The .01 field
  for both files is included.
  
  It was pointed out that the QUEUED TO RUN ON VOLUME SET field in the 
  OPTION SCHEDULING file would not allow the use of the NODE syntax
  that is allowed in the DEVICE file.
  
  DAY-0196-42100,  HUN-1195-21343,  BRX-1095-12548
  After a user process all the alerts, it still asks to process alerts even 
  though there no more alerts. it is nuisance. Why it happening? in XQALERT1  
  DOIT+8 it  checks for the values XQX1 and XQAROU. After all alerts are   
  processed, XQX1 is cleaned up properly but not XQAROU.

  ========================================================================= 
  Installation: (With patch XM*7.1*24 and XU*8*21 installed.
  
   1. These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
   2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
   4. Users can be on the system.
      (It is possible that a few users could see an error.)
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*20'
      A POST-INIT will run to build the B X-ref for the
      Secondary menu in the New Person file.
   6. MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
   7. AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
