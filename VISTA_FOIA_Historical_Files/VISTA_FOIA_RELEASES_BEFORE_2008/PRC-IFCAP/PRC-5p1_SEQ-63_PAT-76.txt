   *     Sites that are already using CoreFLS, rather than IFCAP       *
   *     for purchasing and inventory, should not install this patch   *
   *     as IFCAP has been retired at your site and edits are not      *

 The purpose of this patch is to modify the Funds Distribution module of
 IFCAP, allowing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to comply with
 the FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill.
  
  
 Rationale
 ---------
 The Fiscal Year 2004 Omnibus Appropriations bill, mandated by Congress,
 has reclassified VHA funds for distribution, obligations, and expenses.
 The new funding will be implemented April 1, 2004, and is retroactive to
 October 1, 2003.
  
  
 Current Funding/Appropriations
 ------------------------------
 1. Medical Care Appropriation (36 160)
 2. Medical Administration and Miscellaneous Operating Expense (MAMOE)
    (36 0152)
  
  
 New Funding/Appropriations (FY04)
 ---------------------------------
 1. Medical Services       (36 0160)
 2. Medical Administration (36 0152)
 3. Medical Facilities     (36 0162)
  
  
 1 - Medical Services (36 0160)
 ------------------------------
 The medical services appropriation will finance medical services for 
 veterans and beneficiaries in VA, state, and contract medical facilities.
  
  
 2 - Medical Administration (36 0152)
 ------------------------------------
 The medical administration appropriation will fund VHA headquarter offices
 as well as the costs of the VISNs, facility directors, all information
 technology hardware and software, legal services, billing and coding
 activities, procurement, and related administrative activities.
  
  
 3 - Medical Facilities     (36 0162)
 ------------------------------------
 The medical facilities appropriation will finance the operation, 
 maintenance, and security of VHA's capital infrastructure including costs
 for utilities, engineering, capital planning, leases, laundry and food
 services, grounds keeping, garbage, housekeeping, facility repair, and
 property disposition and acquisition.
  
 New Functionality
 ----------------- 
 New functionality has been added to ensure successful implementation of
 the FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill.  This includes two new reports,
 and one copy function.  Please see the User's Guide for FY2004 Omnibus 
 Appropriation for greater detail.  The new options are located under
 the Fund Control Point Management Menu [PRCB FCP MGMT].
  
                  Fund Control Point Management Menu
                  ----------------------------------
                  Add/Edit Control Point
                  Deactivate a Fund Control Point
                  Reactivate a Fund Control Point
                  Place Released Ceiling Transaction in CP File
                  Display Control Point Committed Transactions
                  Reset FCP Yearly Accounting Element & ACT Code
     NEW =>  CPL  Control Point Listing w/Cost Centers
     NEW =>  CPE  Control Point Listing w/Cost Center Exceptions  
     NEW =>       Copy Control Point User and Profiles
  
  
 1. Control Point Listing w/Cost Centers [PRCB FCP LIST CC]
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    This report will be used by the Budget Analysts to list the cost 
    centers associated with each control point.
  
  
 2. Control Point Listing w/Cost Center Exceptions [PRCB FCP LIST EXCP]
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This report will be used by the Budget Analysts to list which control 
    points have inappropriate cost centers associated with the fund.
  
  
 3. Copy Control Point User and Profiles [PRCB FCP USER COPY]
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    This functionality will allow the Budget Analyst to 'copy' control
    points users, and its profiles from one control point and assign them
    to another.
  
    IMPORTANT NOTE: This option should only be used to populate control
    point users for new control points in support of the FY04 Omnibus
    Appropriations Law.  For the option to work properly, it is essential 
    that no individuals are currently assigned to the control point.  If 
    users exist in the destination control point, nothing will be copied.
  
  
 Fund Guide/Templates
 ---------------------
 Entries have been made to specific IFCAP files to expedite and facilitate 
 implementation of the new funds.  These default entries will serve as
 guides/templates to assist the users, and may be edited at the site using
 the Fund Enter/Edit [PRCD FUND ENTER/EDIT] menu option.  The new funds are 
 0152A1, 0152A7, 0162A1, & 0162A7.
  
 NOTE:  If an error occurs during the installation of the PRCD REQUIRED
        FIELDS file (#420.18) a listing of the error containing the FUND, 
        DOCUMENT TYPE, and ELEMENT TYPE may be found in the INSTALL FILE.
        Using Appendix A in the User's Guide it will be possible to 
        determine what the correct entry should be and edit it using the
        Fund Enter/Edit [PRCD FUND ENTER/EDIT] menu option.
