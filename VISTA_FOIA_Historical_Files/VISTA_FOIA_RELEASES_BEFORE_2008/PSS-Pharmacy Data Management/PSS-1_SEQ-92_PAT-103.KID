 1. PSI-05-051:  A priority status of ASAP is not easily seen by the 
"BLD",6008,1,2,0)
    finishing pharmacist.  A STAT order is displayed as blinking and 
"BLD",6008,1,3,0)
    highlighted, but a ASAP order does not have any special visual
"BLD",6008,1,4,0)
    effects.  
"BLD",6008,1,5,0)
 
"BLD",6008,1,6,0)
    In order to avoid adding more special visual effects to the screen 
"BLD",6008,1,7,0)
    this patch is designed to provide two System Parameters that will
"BLD",6008,1,8,0)
    allow the site a choice of what orders are sent to the PSJ STAT
"BLD",6008,1,9,0)
    NOW ACTIVE ORDER and PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER mail groups.
"BLD",6008,1,10,0)
    The site can select STAT, ASAP, or NOW orders, or any combination of 
"BLD",6008,1,11,0)
    the three for notification via the mail group functionality.
"BLD",6008,1,12,0)
 
"BLD",6008,1,13,0)
    This patch is adding two additional fields (parameters) to file 59.7, 
"BLD",6008,1,14,0)
    PHARMACY SYSTEM FILE to enable the sites to select the priorities that
"BLD",6008,1,15,0)
    will be used in the Inpatient Medications PENDING and ACTIVE order 
"BLD",6008,1,16,0)
    notification software.  This will solve the reported problem in 
"BLD",6008,1,17,0)
    HD98412 / PSI-05-051 by enabling the site to be notified when ASAP 
"BLD",6008,1,18,0)
    orders are submitted by the physician.
