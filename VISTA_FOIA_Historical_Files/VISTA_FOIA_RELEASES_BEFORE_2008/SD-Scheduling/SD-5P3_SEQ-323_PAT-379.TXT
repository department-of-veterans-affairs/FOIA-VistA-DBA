 Availability option.  This problem occurs when the clinic has been cancelled,
 then restored and the same patient is rescheduled for an appointment on the 
 same date and time that they were previously scheduled.

 entries.  If a duplicate is encountered while processing, the record will be 
 skipped and duplicate displays and letters will not be produced.
