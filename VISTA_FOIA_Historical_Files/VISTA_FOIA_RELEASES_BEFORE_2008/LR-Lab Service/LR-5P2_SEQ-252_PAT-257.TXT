Description:

 Blood Bank Clearance:
 =====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*257 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by
 VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*257 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
 
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*257 have no effect on Blood Bank 
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes made,
 no specific validation requirements exist as a result of installation of 
 this patch.
 
 This patch provides the ability to print an Antimicrobial Trend Report by
 division.  There are three new additions to the LAB DATA (#63) file-
 one new field for the "CH" subscript and two new fields for the "MI"
 subscript.  These fields will be used to capture the ordering location
 and institution during accessioning.  In the MICROBIOLOGY (#63.05) sub-file
 of the LAB DATA (#63) file, the new fields are REQUESTING LOC/DIV 
 (#63.05,.111) and ACCESSIONING INSTITUTION (#63.05,.112).  In the CHEM, HEM,
 TOX, RIA, SER, etc. (#63.04) sub-file of the LAB DATA (#63) file, the new
 field is ACCESSIONING INSTITUTION (#63.04,.112).  In the CHEM, HEM, TOX, RIA,
 SER, etc. (#63.04) subfile of the LAB DATA (#63) file, the REQUESTING
 LOC/DIV (#63.04,.111) field is modified to remove the screen on INSTITUTION
 file (#4) since sites need to be able to point to entries in the INSTITUTION
 file (#4) that are not VA facilities such as DoD and commercial/civilian
 facilities.
 
 ALB-0600-50112/HD0000000069278:
 Patch LR*5.2*257 also corrects two typographical errors. The query portion of
 the Microbiology Trend Entry routine has two typographical errors. The word
 misspelled as susceptability should be susceptibility. Also, the misspelled
 word procede should be proceed.
 
 MODIFIED OPTION
 ===============
 NAME: LRMITS                            MENU TEXT: Microbiology Trend Report
   TYPE: run routine
   HELP FRAME: LRMITS OPTION             PACKAGE: LAB SERVICE
  DESCRIPTION:   The antimicrobial trend report is used to compare counts of
  organisms and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility.  Different types of
  reports can be generated.  The types of reports are categorized by: organism,
  specimen, collection sample, patient, physician, and location.  Specific
  criteria can be applied to all report types.  Criteria include: specific
  types of organisms, isolates collected after a specified time from admission,
  merge criteria, antibiotic patterns, and detailed reports.  These reports
  can be printed by division or for selected divisions.
