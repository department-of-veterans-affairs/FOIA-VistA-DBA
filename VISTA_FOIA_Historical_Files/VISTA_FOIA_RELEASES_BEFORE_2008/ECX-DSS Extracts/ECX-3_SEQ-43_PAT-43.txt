============

 Description:
 ===========
  
 This patch modifies the QUASAR (ECQ) portion of the DSS Extract package to 
 include Event Capture National Procedure Codes for sites using QUASAR version 
 3.0 and higher who have Divisions set up to use Event Capture National 
 Procedure Codes for A&SP Clinic Visits in the A&SP SITE PARAMETERS file 
 (#509850.8) for the current fiscal year.
 
 The following modifications were made to accommodate the use of Event Capture 
 Procedure Codes:
  
 1. Changes to the QUASAR (ECQ) EXTRACT routine as follows:
 
 a) Modification of the routine to populate the PROCEDURE field (#11) of the 
 QUASAR EXTRACT file(#727.825) with the EVENT CAPTURE PROCEDURE field (#.01) of 
 the EVENT CAPTURE PROCEDURE multiple (#509850.615) of the A&SP CLINIC VISIT 
 file (#509850.6), when available.  Event Capture Procedure codes are used in 
 QUASAR when a Division is set up to use these codes for a given fiscal year.
 
 Note:  When the PROCEDURE field (#11) is populated with Event Capture codes 
 in the QUASAR EXTRACT (#727.825), the volume will not be appended to the end as 
 is the case with CPT codes.
 
 b) Modification of the routine to populate the VOLUME field (#12) and the 
 volume piece of the PCE CPT CODE QUANTITY AND MODIFIERS field (#29) of the 
 QUASAR EXTRACT file (#727.825) with the VOLUME field (#.03) of the EVENT 
 CAPTURE PROCEDURE multiple (#509850.615) of the A&SP CLINIC VISIT file 
 (#509850.6) when Event Capture Procedure codes are used.
 
 c) Modification of the routine to populate the PROVIDER field (#16) of the 
 QUASAR EXTRACT file (#727.825) with the EC PROCEDURE PROVIDER field (#.05) of 
 the EVENT CAPTURE PROCEDURE multiple (#509850.615) of the A&SP CLINIC VISIT 
 file (#509850.6) when Event Capture Procedure codes are used.
 
 Note: The above fields will continue to be populated as before when Event 
 Capture Procedure Codes are not available for the QUASAR visit.
 
 
 2. Modification of the QUASAR (ECQ) Extract Audit [ECX QSR SOURCE AUDIT] 
 report to accommodate the use of Event Capture Procedure codes.  In the event 
 that Event Capture Procedure codes are used by one or more divisions for 
 the fiscal year for which the extract was run, the user will be given the 
 option to display either Event Capture Procedures or the corresponding CPT 
 codes.
 
 3. Modification of the technical description in the Data Dictionary of the 
 PROCEDURE field (#11) of both the EVENT CAPTURE LOCAL EXTRACT file (#727.815) 
 and the QUASAR EXTRACT file (#727.825) to more accurately reflect the 
 population of the field, describing the differences between the use of CPT Code 
 and Event Capture Procedure Codes.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 
  IT staff should coordinate the installation of this patch with the local 
  DSS Site Team to ensure that corresponding actions in the Austin DSS 
  database are accomplished if required.
 
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system, but coordinate with DSS 
  Extract users to prevent use of options until installation has been 
  completed.  
      
    If you are running the install interactively, installation will take less 
    than 2 minutes.  Rebuilding of menu trees is not necessary after the 
    installation of this patch.
      
    No harm to your database will occur if the installation is performed  
    more than once.
      
    1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
        the KIDS distribution included with this message.
       
    2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
        ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
        from the mapped set at this time.
       
    3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation menu.  
       
    4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*43):
   
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
       
    5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*43.
      
    6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
        you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
     
        Extract Manager's Options   [ECXMGR]
     
    7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
        to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
