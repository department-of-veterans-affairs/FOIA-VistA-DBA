Associated patches: (v)MPIF*1*35   <<= must be installed BEFORE `MPIF*1*38'

Subject: VTQ changed to VQQ in Real-Time MPI Queries

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  MPIF and RG patches should NOT be installed on Legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Coordinating Master 
  of Records (CMORs) or Treating Facilities.
  
  This patch is in support of the Master Patient Index/Patient
  Demographics (MPI/PD) maintenance project.
  
  Issue 1:  In order to be in line with the Health Level Seven (HL7) 2.4 
  standard, the real-time query messages should be passing VQQ-Q02 instead
  of VTQ-Q02 in the MSH segment.  This change has been made in MPIFQ0 and
  MPIFSA2.  
  
  NOTE:  The MPI Austin side will be modified to send back ACK-Q02 instead
  of ADT-A31 in the MSH segment that is a response to the VQQ-Q02.  No 
  coding change is needed on the VistA side to support this change.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*38.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Single Patient Initialization to MPI    [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]
         Display Only Query              [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] 
         Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
         10-10T Registration             [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     
         Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           
         Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]          
         Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
