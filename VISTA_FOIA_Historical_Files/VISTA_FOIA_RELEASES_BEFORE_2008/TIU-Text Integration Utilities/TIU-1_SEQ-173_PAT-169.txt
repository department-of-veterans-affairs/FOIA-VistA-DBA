Subject: DOCUMENT DEFS FOR C&P WORKSHEETS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 I. DESCRIPTION:
    ============
 This patch provides 58 new C&P Document Definitions in support of patch
 DVBA*2.7*53 - C&P WORKSHEET MODULE PHASE.
  
 C&P Progress Notes are generally entered and signed in the CAPRI GUI
 application, using the new AMIE Exam Worksheet Module. From CAPRI they are
 automatically uploaded into TIU and stored as Progress Notes, using these
 new Document Definitions and/or using titles created by sites themselves.
 Instead of or in addition to entering exams using CAPRI and the C&P
 Worksheet module, sites may begin the process from TIU, either uploading
 C&P notes directly into TIU via the usual TIU upload options, or entering
 C&P notes manually from CPRS GUI or TIU List Manager options.  Such
 documents are then copied manually into AMIE after entry in TIU.
  
 Storing C&P Exam Reports in TIU permits them to be viewed as part of the
 patient record along with other Progress Notes.
  
 An option included in patch TIU*1*169 may be run after the patch is
 installed and creates the 58 new Document Definitions when run. Sites are
 not REQUIRED to use the 58 new Document Definitions (DDEFS). If a site
 does not intend to use any of these new DDEFS, the site should not run the
 option.
  
 If a site intends to use some or all of the 57 new Titles, the site must
 run the option after installing the patch. The Document Class is created
 ACTIVE and is National Standard. The 57 Titles are created INACTIVE and
 are not National Standard.
  
 The site should review policy on C&P Examination Reports, review its ASU
 business rules for C&P documents, and then activate any Titles it plans to
 use.
  
 This patch does NOT enforce data consistency between AMIE and TIU.
 Although specific recommendations for business rules are outside the scope
 of this patch, Section VI., BUSINESS RULE GUIDELINES may help.

 should review Business Rules before activating Titles. See Section VI.,
 BUSINESS RULE GUIDELINES.
  
  
 OPTIONS:
 ========
 This patch exports option Create DDEFS for C&P Worksheets [TIU169 DDEFS,
 C&P WORKSHEETS]. It is this option, not the patch itself, which creates
 the new standard TIU Document Definitions.
  
 The option creates global ^XTMP("TIU169") to track which DDEFS it has
 created. The global is small. When the option is run, the deletion date
 for the global is set to 2 years from the date the option is run. The
 global is automatically deleted according to its deletion date by Option
 Clean old Job Nodes in XUTL [XQ XUTL $J NODES].
  
 For more information on this option, see Section V, POST-INSTALLATION 
 INSTRUCTIONS, below.

 IV. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
     ==========================
  
  Installation of this patch will take less than 2 minutes. Users need not
 be off the system when applying this patch, and it can be installed at any
 time of day.
  
  1. Use PackMan option, INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE to load the transport 
     global. Then, on the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the
     following options as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
  2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
     option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (TIU*1.0*169)
     The environment check looks for user class CLINICAL COORDINATOR.
     This user class was exported with the original release of TIU, and TIU
     expects to find it there.  Ownership of the new Document Definitions
     is assigned to this user class.  If the environment check
     fails to find class CLINICAL COORDINATOR, it will post a warning.
     Although the patch will go ahead and install, the option to create the
     DDEFS will not run until the user class is present.
  
  3. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? YES//", respond 'NO'.
  
  4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond 'NO'.
  
  5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond 'YES', and DISABLE the TIU* Options and
     Protocols.
  
  6. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
  7. After installing the patch, sites who wish to use any of the new 
     standard DDEFS must run option TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS. See
     Section V,, POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
  
     Sites who choose not to create the new DDEFS should delete the option,
     as well as routines TIUEN169, TIUPS169, and TIU169D after the
     released patch has been installed successfully. Please verify
     checksums before deleting the routines.
  
  8. Sites who choose to create the new DDEFS should delete the option, as
     well as routines TIUEN169, TIUPS169, and TIU169D after the released
     patch has been installed and after option TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS
     has successfully created all 58 Document Definitions. Please verify
     checksums before deleting the routines.
  
  9. We do not anticipate any need to reinstall this patch. However, it
     may be reinstalled if necessary.
  
  
 V. POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    ===============================
  
 NOTE: Sites who choose not to create the new DDEFS may ignore these  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
  
 Option TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS is exported with the patch.  It is run
 after the patch is installed. It is this option, not the patch itself,
 which actually creates the new standard Document Definitions for C&P Exam
 Reports.
  
 BEFORE RUNNING OPTION TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS:
 ===================================================
  
 The option asks if the user wishes to designate an existing Document Class
 (DC) to create the new titles in. We suggest that sites with existing C&P
 titles in a particular DC designate that DC.
  
 Also, if sites wish to continue using existing titles under that DC, and
 they correspond to new exported titles, we suggest that the site edit the
 existing titles to exactly match the exported ones BEFORE running the
 option. The option then skips the matching titles in the designated DC and
 does not attempt to recreate them.
  
 RUNNING OPTION TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS:                             
 ============================================
 The option should take one or two minutes to run and will not disrupt
 users, so it can be run at any time of day.
  
 The option is run from programmer mode.

 The user is asked if they wish to designate an existing Document Class 
 (DC) to create the new titles in:
                      ******************** 
 I can create a new C&P Document Class or you can designate an existing 
 one. If you designate an existing one, I will change its name to C&P

 any you already have. Do you want to designate a Document Class? YES//
                      ******************** 
 If the user declines to designate a DC, choosing to create a new one for 
 the new titles, the option checks for potential duplicates and quits if it
 finds any:
                      ******************** 
 Do you want to designate a Document Class? YES// NO
  
 You already have the following DDEFS exported by this patch. I cannot 
 create duplicates. Please change their names so they no longer match
 exported DDEFS, or if you are not using them, delete them. If you change
 the name of a DDEF you plan to continue using, remember to update its
 Print Name as well.
 For help, contact Enterprise Vista Support.
  
 You may not run this option until these matches are eliminated.

 If the user designates an existing DC for the new titles, the option 
 checks for potential duplicates OUTSIDE of the designated DC and quits if 
 it finds any, as above.
  
 If it does not find any potential duplicates OUTSIDE of the designated DC,
 it goes on to change the name of the designated DC to C&P EXAMINATION
 REPORTS if the DC names differ and to create the new Titles under the
 designated DC, skipping any matching Titles that already exist under that
 DC. (The site may wish to update the Print Name of the designated DC; the 
 option does not update Print Name.)

 choice, the option proceeds using the designated/created DC:

 AFTER RUNNING OPTION TIU169 DDEFS, C&P WORKSHEETS:
 ================================================== 
 When the option has run successfully to the end and messages have
 indicated that all Document Definitions have been created successfully
 with no problems encountered, the option should be deleted, along with
 routines TIUEN169, TIUPS169, and TIU169D, after verifying the checksums.
  
 If problems are encountered creating one or more DDEFS, sites may contact 
 Enterprise Vista Support (EVS) for help.  Once the problem has been
 resolved, the option should be run again until all DDEFS have been
 created. It will attempt to create only those DDEFS not successfully
 created previously.
  
 If the option is run again after Document Definitions have already been
 created successfully, no harm is done. The user is simply informed that
 the entries were already created successfully. (This assumes that the
 option and routines have not been deleted, and that the XTMP global has
 not yet been deleted. It should not auto-delete until at least 2 years
 after the option was last run.)
  
  
 VI. BUSINESS RULE GUIDELINES:
 =============================
  
 Sites should already be aware of policy on communicating and maintaining
 data consistency between AMIE and TIU.  This document does NOT attempt to 
 discuss policy except in connection to its implications for business
 rules.
  
 This document does not recommend specific business rules. Sites should
 already have appropriate business rules in place for their existing C&P
 Document Definitions. This document does, however, provide several 
 guidelines.
  
 We recommend reviewing both policy and business rules before activating 
 new titles.  Business rules should be appropriate and should cover all C&P
 titles, as necessary.
  
 Documents stored in TIU present data consistency issues since they are
 also stored in AMIE and since reports are sent to third parties such as
 VBA, as well.
  
 Current TIU/CP software does NOT ENFORCE DATA CONSISTENCY OR COMMUNICATION
 AMONG C&P STAKEHOLDERS. Consistency and communication among those with
 access to C&P reports must be maintained manually, by policy.
 Nevertheless, business rules may help minimize data consistency issues.
  
  
 GUIDELINES:
 ===========
 First, in order to minimize these issues, sites may wish to limit actions
 ENTRY and MAKE ADDENDUM to appropriate users.  Note that Business Rules
 for ENTRY and SIGNATURE of C&P Reports are observed whether entry is made
 from AMIE or from TIU/CPRS.
  
 Also, users who Enter or Addend C&P documents using CPRS GUI, TIU UPLOAD,
 or TIU List Manager options should be aware that narratives are stored in
 two separate places and that TIU makes no attempt to update or inform AMIE
 when documents are entered or updated in TIU.
  
 Second, corrective, TIU manager actions such as REASSIGN should be
 restricted to one or two individuals who are familiar with policy, and can
 carry it out.
  
 Corrective action on the TIU side to completed documents should be made
 using the TIU List Manager menu of corrective actions. These actions,
 however, do NOT update AMIE.  AMIE must be updated manually in a separate
 action.
  
 When making changes on the AMIE side for TIU actions DELETE and REASSIGN,
 the TIU document Internal Entry Number stored in AMIE must be updated
 AFTER corrective action is taken in TIU.
