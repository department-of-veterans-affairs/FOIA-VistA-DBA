 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD143141   Updates for 2 AMIE Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Worksheets
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Dr. Vicki Milton (VBAVACO) has requested that updates be made to
    the current AMIE Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Worksheets:
    Initial Evaluation for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Review
    Examination for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    a)  Created post-install routine DVBA87PI which will deactivate the
        current worksheets in file 396.6 and activate the new
        worksheets in file 396.6.  The current IENs for these worksheets
        in file 396.6 are:  Initial Evaluation for PTSD (177) and Review
        Examination for PTSD (176).  The new IENs will be 196 (Initial
        Evaluation for PTSD), and 197 (Review Examination for PTSD).
    b)  Created routines DVBCWPF1, DVBCWPF2 and DVBCWPF3 which contain the
        text for the AMIE Initial Evaluation for PTSD worksheet.  Created
        routine DVBCWPF which will access the text routines and print the
        worksheet.
    c)  Created routines DVBCWPG1, DVBCWPG2 and DVBCWPG3 which contain the
        text for the AMIE Review Examination for PTSD worksheet.  Created
        routine DVBCWPG which will access the text routines and print the
        worksheet.
  
 DATA DICTIONARY CHANGES:
 ========================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA87PI, will create 2 new records
 in the AMIE Exam file (396.6) for the 2 PTSD worksheets described above
 and deactivate the existing records for those same 2 PTSD worksheets.
 This is done, per request by VBAVACO, for historical purposes.
