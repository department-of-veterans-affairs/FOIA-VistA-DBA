Description:
============

 This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs 
 (NCPDP) standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance 
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch
 is one of six to be released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS 
 multi-build distribution containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three
 patches will be released individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62,
 and PSS*1*115.  There is no recommended order to installing the stand-alone 
 patches and they can be installed independently of the multi-build as there 
 is no dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
 patches.  For more specific instructions please refer to the installation 
 steps provided in each of the stand-alone patches.
  
 Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
 will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
 (ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of claims
 activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report. 
   
 Patch IB*2*342 includes the following modifications:
                                                           
 1. The software components supporting the pharmacy billing events 
 interactions between Integrated Billing (IB), Outpatient Pharmacy (OP), 
 and ECME were modified to store data in a permanent file.  The IB 
 NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14) was created to store electronic pharmacy
 application interfacing events data.  Additionally, data stored in this 
 file is used by the ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING 
 EVENTS] to provide details related to electronic pharmacy claims 
 processing and about communication details between IB and the subscribing 
 applications. The global root for the new file is ^IBCNR(366.14 and data 
 growth will be continual.
  
 2. A mail bulletin was added to inform the mailgroup that a patient copay has 
 not been released from hold after several attempts to release.  This existing 
 mailgroup is defined at the MEANS TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP field (#.11) in the 
 IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9).   
  
 3.  The existing mail bulletin that informed the mailgroup that a patient 
 copay was released from hold was removed as it determined by the IB user that 
 the mail bulletin was no longer needed for this condition. The existing 
 mailgroup is defined at the MEANS TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP field (#.11) in 
 the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9).
                                                         
 4. The software supporting the Clerk Productivity Report option [IB OUTPUT CLK
 PROD] was modified to include a divisional sort for POSTMASTER.  
  
 5. The software that is called by the $$STORESP^IBNCPDP function was modified 
 to handle the newly created REOPEN event.  This new REOPEN event is generated 
 by the ECME application and calls the $$STORESP function in order for IB to 
 store billing related data in the CLAIMS TRACKING file (#356).

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ==============================
 The post-install routine was designed to move data from 
 ^XTMP("IBNCPDP-<DATE>") global into the IB NCPDP EVENT LOG file (#366.14) 
 which is a new file created and exported with IB*2*342.  The time required 
 to accomplish this task may vary from site to site and depends on how many 
 electronic pharmacy claims are processed daily at the site. The ^XTMP global 
 will not be removed by the post-install process since the subscripts will be 
 deleted as they expire and eventually they all will be deleted in 90 days 
 from the installation date.
 
 
 Documentation Retrieval
 =======================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov, 
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
   
  The documentation distribution includes:
  
     FILE NAME                         DESCRIPTION
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     BPS_1_UM_R0806.PDF                ECME V. 1.0 User Manual 
     BPS_1_TM_R0806.PDF                ECME V. 1.0 Technical Manual/Security
                                       Guides
     PSO_7_P247_UM_CP.PDF              OP V. 7.0 User Manual Change Pages
   
  3. Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation Library
    (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, http://www.va.gov/vdl.
  
     Note: When downloading these files from the ftp server, set the file 
           format to binary mode.
 
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Considerations:
 
   1. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated by the BPS
      Nightly Background Job [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB].  Wait for this job
      to finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
   2. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
      transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
      complete the installation before the transmission starts.
   3. It is recommended that the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build be 
      installed or QUEUED to be installed during off-peak hours to avoid 
      disruptions.  Due to a conversion process performed by the IB*2*342 
      post-install routine, installation time can be quite extensive (taking
      an estimated one to four hours to complete) for those sites that have 
      been activated with the HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL software for more than one 
      month. For those sites that have not yet been activated with the HIPAA 
      NCPDP - GLOBAL software, the installation time will be less than 10 
      minutes.
  
 The conversion process mentioned above will not affect pharmacy and billing 
 operations, therefore, users can be on the system during the IB*2*342 
 post-installation process. However, it is recommended that the ECME 
 Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option be disabled 
 during installation as it may display irregular results if run during the 
 installation process (see item 11 in the installation steps).
  
 To Install the BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 multi-build distribution:
  
 1.  Obtain the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the following
     three patch installs:
  
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, select the Load a Distribution option.
  
 4.  When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", enter the full directory path
     where you saved the host file BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID (e.g., 
     SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_3_PSO_IB.KID).
  
 5.  When prompted for "OK to continue with Load? NO//", enter "YES."
     
     The following will display:
  
       Loading Distribution...
  
         BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0
         BPS*1.0*3
         PSO*7.0*247
         IB*2.0*342
       
 Use INSTALL name BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0 to install this Distribution.
    
 6.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 1.0")
  
     6.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     6.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     6.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 7. Back in the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option.
  
 8. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 
    1.0."
  
 9. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
    Yes//" for the BPS*1.0*3 build, respond "YES."  For the build IB*2.0*342, 
    respond "NO."
  
  
 10. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond "NO." 
  
 11. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//", enter "YES"
  
     11.1 When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          Enter the following options:
  
              ECME Billing Events Report  [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS]
  
     11.2 When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':' 
          press <RET>
  
 12. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device or 
     queue this to P-Message.
 
 13. For sites that have already activated ePharmacy functionality, there is a
     post-installation step, which is to check the BPS NCPDP Logical link. In
     most cases, the link will be running (STATE=ENABLED or INACTIVE). If this
     link is not running it will need to be restarted.  To turn on the logical
     link, run the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option located on the Filer and
     Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7
     Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK
     NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP", and when prompted for "Method for running the
     receiver", choose the default of B - Background to enable the logical link.
