Description:
============

 The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
 adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
 different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
 Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
 using the NCPDP standard. 
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
 their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH

    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (AR) V. 4.5                      PRCA*4.5*230
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
 electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
 and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
 through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
 electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
 real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
 Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
 being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
 appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
 resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
 returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
 create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
 the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
 a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
 receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
  
 The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
 electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
 electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
 processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
 and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
 Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
 includes:
  
    . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
    . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
      the IB application.
    . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
      another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
      time saver.
    . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
   
 Overview of the Process:
   
 When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
 OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
 contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
 billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
 claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
 package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
 it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
 WebMD).
   
 Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
 payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
 is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
 the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
 the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
   
 For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
 claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
 CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
 received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
 or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
 facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
 the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
 the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
 background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
 indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
 is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
 fill.
  
 This patch enables the previous dormant release.  Electronic pharmacy claims
 can now be sent to the payers so that pharmacy claims can received
 reimbursement from third party payers.  Functionality contained in this patch
 include setup options for configuration support, reports for monitoring claims
 activity and a user screen for validating and ongoing processing of electronic
 pharmacy claims.
  
 Special Note:  The EPHARM IN logical link, which was created in the dormant
 release of ECME, is no longer used and can be shut down, if desired.  Please
 do not delete or rename this logical link at this time.  It will be removed 
 by a later patch.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project documentation is available on the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of Information
 (OI) Field Offices.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov,
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP IN THE
 EXACT ORDER INDICATED BELOW. ONCE STARTED, THE INSTALLATION NEEDS TO BE
 COMPLETED. FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION (ONCE STARTED) WILL
 LIKELY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR USERS OF THE 6 APPLICATIONS INVOLVED IN THIS 
 PROJECT.
  
 BEFORE PROCEEDING, please read item number 12.2 and make sure you have the
 information needed in order to complete this installation.
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of these patches. These
 patches should be installed during non-peak hours to avoid disruptions.
  
 Installation should take approximately 15 minutes.
   
 Notes: 1. You cannot queue this installation for a later time, because you
           will be prompted to enter information during the installation.
        2. DO NOT install patch PSX*2*48 when prescriptions are being
           transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or
           complete the installation before the transmission starts.
        3. For existing test sites, stop the BPS NCPDP logical link.  Turn off
           the logical link using the Start/Stop Links [HL START] option, which
           is on the Filer and Link Management Options option [HL MENU FILER
           LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] option.  When 
           prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter BPS NCPDP and when 
           asked whether it is "Okay to shut down this job?", enter YES.
  
  
 1.  These patches will be sent to your system upon release from the National
     Patch Module:
     
       - Patch PSS*1*90
       - Patch PSX*2*48
       - Patch PRCA*4.5*230
  
     Obtain the host file ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID, which contains the following
     three KIDS build distributions:
       
         PSO*7.0*148
         BPS*1.0*1
         IB*2.0*276
  
 Sites may retrieve the host file in one of the following ways:
  
  1.1 The preferred method is to FTP the file from download.vista.med.va.gov,
     which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
  
  1.2 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
  
   
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, for each of the three patches (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and
    PRCA*4.5*230), you may select to use the following options:
  
     3.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     3.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     3.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
     Note: When prompted for INSTALL NAME, you should enter the corresponding
           names for each patch as shown below:
  
               PATCH                  INSTALL NAME
               -----------------------------------
               PSS*1*90               PSS*1.0*90
               PSX*2*48               PSX*2.0*48
               PRCA*4.5*230           PRCA*4.5*230
   
 4.  From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and for 
     each one of the three patches (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and PRCA*4.5*230) follow 
     the instructions below: 
   
     4.1. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter the corresponding
          name for the patch you are installing (see table above).
   
     4.2. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
           YES//", respond "NO." 
  
     4.3. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
          Protocols? YES//", respond "NO."
  
     4.4. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and
          DO NOT queue to P-Message.
   
 5.  After the installation of the 3 patches is complete (PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48,
     PRCA*4.5*230), return to the Kernel Installation and Distribution System
     (KIDS) Menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 6.  From the Installation menu, select the Load a Distribution option.
  
 7.  When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", enter the full directory path
     where you saved the host file ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID (e.g., 
     SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ANONYMOUS]ECME_HIPAA_NCPDP_P3.KID).
  
 8.  When prompted for "OK to continue with Load? NO//", enter "YES."
     
     The following will display:
  
       Loading Distribution...
  
         ECME HIPAA NCPDP P3 1.0
         BPS*1.0*1

 9.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "ECME HIPAA NCPDP P3
     1.0")
   
     9.1. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other
          changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or templates.
  
     9.2. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
          installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
          templates, etc.).
   
     9.3. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure the
          integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 10.  Back in the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option.
  
 11. When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter "ECME HIPAA NCPDP P3
     1.0."
  
 12. For each one of the builds contained in the master build, the following
     set of prompts will be asked:
  
     Note: Information such as the example below about files contained in the
           build will be displayed for each KIDS build that contains Data 
           Dictionary changes:
             
                 Incoming Files:
  
                   52        PRESCRIPTION  (Partial Definition)
                 Note:  You already have the 'PRESCRIPTION' File.
   
     12.1. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
           Install? Yes//". For the builds PSO*7.0*148 and IB*2.0*276, respond
           "NO." For the BPS*1.0*1 build, respond "YES."
      
     12.2. For the BPS*1.0*1 installation, when prompted for Incoming Mail 
           Groups:
  
                "Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'BPS OPECC':"
  
           Please, contact your Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) business
           department prior to installation to determine who will be the 
           coordinator for this new mail group. This mail group will be used
           by the BPS Nightly Background Job. Its members will receive
           bulletins about electronic claims.
      
 13. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond "NO." 
  
 14. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//", respond "NO."
  
 15. When prompted, "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and DO NOT
     queue this to P-Message.
  
 16. TEST SITES ONLY: A post-installation step for test sites is to restart the 
     BPS NCPDP Logical link.  To turn on the logical link use the  Start/Stop 
     Links [HL START] option, which is on the Filer and Link Management Options 
     option [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] submenu of the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU] 
     option.  When prompted for the HL LOGICAL LINK NODE, enter "BPS NCPDP" and 
     that will enable the logical link.
  
 17. The functionality will be implemented at sites in a phased schedule.
     Before performing the steps to activate ePharmacy functionality, all 
     non-test sites should wait to be contacted by the Chief Business 
     Office (CBO).
