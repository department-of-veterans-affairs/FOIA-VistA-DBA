Subject: SPELLING ERROR AND RX INTERVENTION PKG NOT WORKING.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects misspelling of absence and inaccurate display of 
 quantity in Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] 
 option.
  
 1. MAR-0504-20101
 =================
  
 PROBLEM: When using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] option, the following will appear: PATIENT ON AUTHORIZED ABSENSE!
  
 SOLUTION:
 a)The Patient Status needs to be changed in FILEMAN. When the status
 is changed to AUTH ABS +96, a message appears:
  
         PATIENT ON AUTHORIZED ABSENSE!
  
 b) In Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), create and sign a drug
 for a patient.  Go into Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] option and notice that the status will be pending.  Do not finish
 the pending drug!  Create a New Order for that same pending drug.
  
 c) Choose an active drug for that patient. Do a COPY and then accept.
  
 d) Create New duplicate Order of an already existing active drug.
  
  
 The spelling of the word ABSENSE will be corrected to ABSENCE.
  
  
 2.  BEC-1004-21964
 ==================
  
 PROBLEM: When using Pharmacy Intervention Menu, [PSO INTERVENTION NEW
 ENTRY], it does not allow data to be input by a Pharmacist.
  
 SOLUTION: The OPTION file (#19), fields Entry Action (#20) and Exit Action
 (#15) needs to be changed to allow LAYGO access.
  
  
 Associated NOIS: 
 ================
  
 1.    MAR-0504-20101     Spelling of Absense
 2.    BEC-1004-21964     Rx Intervention package is not allowing input of

        d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
