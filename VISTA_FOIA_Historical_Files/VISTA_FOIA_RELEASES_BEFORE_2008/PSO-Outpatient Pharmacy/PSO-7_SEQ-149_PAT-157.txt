 This patch does NOT conflict with CoreFLS and can be installed at CoreFLS
 sites.

 PATCH OVERVIEW
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat 
 Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation 
 From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service 
 Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other 
 medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of 
 service connection.
  
 Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed 
 and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this 
 type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the 
 number of product line dependencies. Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim 
 Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in 
 the Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  
 It provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for 
 the combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports 
 cross-referenced against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing 
 process. Phase II of this initiative will involve multiple product lines 
 and additional VistA only development. The main goals of Phase II will be
 to fully automate the copayment billing processing of combat vets based on
 episode of care by providing the appropriate questions at check-out as
 supplied by CPRS.
  
 Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include 
 Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE), 
 Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF. The National Patient 
 Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload 
 reporting. The patches are listed below in the order that they must be 
 installed: 
 Outpatient Pharmacy
     PSO*7*157
     PSX*2*50
 PCE/PTF/Event Capture/Scheduling  - PIMS Host file
     PX*1.0*130
     SD*5.3*325
     DG*5.3*565
     EC*2.0*54
 Integrated Billing
     IB*2.0*247
 CPRS
     OR*3.0*190
 Product Features
 There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
 a. Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical care
    - The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those 
      veterans who qualify as such per the directive.
    - The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
      audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
      schedulers, etc.).
    - Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
      was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
      manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC 
      conditions, etc.
 b. Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
    Combat Related
    - Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to 
      identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
      related condition.
 c. Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care, 
    prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
    treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless
    changed by pharmacist.
  
  
 This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*157 that provides the
 functionality changes to accommodate the new copay classification called
 "Combat Veteran".
  
 1. For the following options, when creating a new order, renewing an
 existing order, copying an existing order to a new order, or editing an
 existing order that results in a new order, the copay status of the
 prescription needs to be determined for billing purposes.
  
 a. Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 b. TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY]
 c. Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
 d. Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
  
 Depending on the patient eligibility, the software currently provides
 the following copay exemption questions to the pharmacist during 
 prescription finishing process:
  
 "Is this Rx for treatment of Vietnam-Era Herbicide (Agent Orange) 
 exposure?" 
  
 "Is this Rx for treatment of ionizing radiation exposure?" 
  
 "Is this Rx for treatment of environmental contaminant exposure during the
 Persian Gulf War?" 
  
 "Is this Rx for treatment of Military Sexual Trauma?"
  
 "Is this Rx related to treatment of Head and/or Neck Cancer?"
 and/or Neck Cancer veterans;
  
 To fulfill the Directive 2002-049, this patch will add the following 
 Combat Veteran (CV) copay exemption question to the current copay list:
  
 "Is this Rx potentially for treatment related to Combat?"
  
 In the event that a patient is eligible for more than one copay 
 exemption, the CV prompt will be presented to the pharmacist first.
  
 A 'YES' or 'NO' response will be stored in the COMBAT VETERAN field 
 (#122) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This is a new field introduced in
 this patch.
  
 2. The Integration Agreement (IA) 2534 provides CPRS the copay related 
 questions that need to be asked during the outpatient medication order
 entry process. This IA is modified to include the CV copay classification,
 if applicable.
  
 3. The PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) that stores the pharmacy 
 orders (new/renew) entered via CPRS is modified to include the provider's
 response to the CV question. The provider's response will be stored in the
 COMBAT VETERAN field (#110.1) of the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file
 (#52.41). The COMBAT VETERAN field (#110.1) is a new field introduced in
 this patch.
  
 4. During the release of a prescription, medication copay exemptions are
 re-evaluated to see if there is a change in the billing status. This logic
 is modified to include the CV copay classification. If a copay exemption
 question applies and is unanswered, a MailMan message is generated. This 
 message is sent to the pharmacist, ordering provider, and holders of the
 PSO COPAY key, to get answers to the exemption questions and reset the
 prescription copay status if needed, using the Reset Copay Status/Cancel
 Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option .
  
 5. The Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option
 is modified to include the CV copay classification wherever applicable.
  
 6. During label printing of a prescription, if a prescription is deemed
 billable then the software does a check on the following copay exemption
 fields of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52):
 117          MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA
 118          AGENT ORANGE EXPOSURE
 119          IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE
 120          ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT
 121          HEAD AND/OR NECK CANCER
 122          COMBAT VETERAN 
 If the prescription is identified as copay exempt, the software will
 print "NO COPAY".
