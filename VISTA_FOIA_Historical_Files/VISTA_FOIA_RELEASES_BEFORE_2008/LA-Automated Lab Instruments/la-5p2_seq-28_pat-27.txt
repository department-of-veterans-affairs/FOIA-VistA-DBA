 BLOOD BANK DEVICE PRODUCT LABELING STATEMENT
  
 September 22, 1997
  
 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*153 contains changes to software 
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 97-033, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 VERSION 5.2.  Changes include:
  
 1)  New fields in files LABORATORY TEST (#60), LAB DATA (#63), and 
     ACCESSION (#68) which are common laboratory utility files used by 
     Blood Bank software.
 2)  Routine LRUPT which is used by the option Show list of accessions for a 
     patient [LRUPT] has been enhanced to display the UID for an accession.
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK 
 SOFTWARE version 5.2 control functions.
  
 PROBLEM:  Patch LR*5.2*153 creates new fields in files LABORATORY TEST 
 (#60), LAB DATA (#63), and ACCESSION (#68) in order to accommodate
 electronic transfer of laboratory results from one hospital site to another
 In addition the routine LRUPT is modified to display the Universal ID
 along with other specimen accession information.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS:   Changes made by patch LA*5.2*27 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Patch LA*5.2*27 does 
 not alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES:  This patch contains changes to files and 
 routines identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive
 97-033. The changes have no effect in Blood Bank functionality or medical
 device control functions. There is no adverse potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  There are no required validation 
 scenarios to be completed by sites after installing this patch.
  
 ===================================
  
 Brief Patch Description:
  
 Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI)
 The advent of a Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) centered 
 organization of VA medical center (VAMC) facilities and the emphasis on 
 outpatient-based primary care will see a significant change in the 
 utilization and focus of the VISTA Laboratory package.  The VISTA 
 Laboratory package has been enhanced to better serve VA Laboratory in 
 its new mission. Major enhancements are:
  
      Electronic Test Ordering
      Laboratory Test Orders Pending Storage Feature
      Universal Specimen Identification
      National Laboratory Test (NLT) Tests Identification
      Bar-code Accessioning
      Automatic Remote Result Reporting
      Automated Collecting Site Electronic Interim Report
      Non VA Trading Partners Electronic Linkage (Pending)
      Enhanced Automated Instrument Capabilities
      Health Level Seven (HL7) Messaging
  
 Test Ordering:
 The previous laboratory test ordering process had a single institution 
 inpatient focus that did not support Veteran Integrated Service Network 
 (VISN) service goals. Enhancement of the VISTA Laboratory V5.2 software
 produced the creation of a "pending orders" system to better manage lab 
 test orders. This system features the following characteristics:
  
 1.   Management and Storage of Electronic Orders
 2.   Specimens Collected at Location, Test Results Generated at another 
       facility
 3.   Transfer of Verified Results Electronically
 4.   Accommodate the Receipt and Storage of Shipping/Ordering Information 
       and Results Reporting
  
 Electronic Messaging:
 LEDI is based on Health Level Seven (HL7) V2.3 messaging protocol and the 
 VISTA LEDI HL7 Interface Standard Specifications V1.1 document. This 
 document should be used as a basis for electronic data interchange.
  
 LEDI provides electronic data interchange between VISTA Laboratories and 
 other VISTA/non-VA Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) for the transmitting 
 and receipting of laboratory test orders, order processing, and result
 reporting.
  
 The collecting facility constructs shipping manifest that lists patients,
 specimens, tests, and other information to properly identify the shipment.
 Shipping manifest is also transmitted electronically to the Host facility.
 Host laboratory  receives the electronic message prior to specimen arrival.
 These electronic orders are stored in a "pending orders" file awaiting the 
 specimen/shipping list arrival. Shipping manifest lists have complete 
 information to allow manual order entry at Host site if required.
  
 Shipping Manifest Information Examples:
     Name of Shipping Facility
     Shipping List ID
     Shipping Date/Time
     Date of Specimen Collection
     List of Tests with Patient Demographics similar to a VISTA Load/Work List
     Bar-coded Labels for Shipping Manifest ID and Patient Demographics
  
 Specimens are processed upon arrival using shipping manifest list, bar-code 
 accessioning of specimens into VISTA from the "pending orders" file. Updates 
 to the LAB PENDING ORDERS ENTRY file (#69.6) with a status of the specimens,
 i.e., received, missing, insufficient quantity, incorrect shipping conditions,
 improper specimen, etc. Storage of links to collecting site/accession for 
 returning of results are also stored in the LAB PENDING ORDERS ENTRY file
 (#69.6).
  
 As testing is being verified, electronic messages are constructed 
 containing test results and returned to the collecting site in batch mode.
 Upon receipt results by the collecting site software an alert message is 
 sent to a specific mail group.
  
 Collecting Site Result Entry:
  
 Test results are verified by the Host laboratory performing the actual test 
 procedure. Therefore editing of verified result by the collecting laboratory
 is not necessary. The electronically transmitted message containing the 
 test results and test flags are stored directly into the collecting 
 laboratory's clinical database.

       From the KERNEL Installation and Distribution Systems (KIDS) 
       Menu, select the Installation menu [XPD INSTALLATION MENU]:  
            Installation
            Edits and Distribution ...  
            Utilities ...  
            Installation ...  
      
   2.  SELECT INSTALLATION OPTION 
       Select Installation Option:  Load a Distribution 
       Enter a Host File: LAB_LEDI.KID
     
       This Distribution contains Transport Globals for the following 
       Package(s): LR*5.2*153
                   LA*5.2*27
  
       Use INSTALL NAME: LA*5.2*27    to install the Distribution.  
       
       NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL: 
     
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
           backup any other changes, such as DDs or templates.  
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).  
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
           transport global.  
      
   3.  Use the install name LA*5.2*27 and refer to the LEDI Installation 
       Guide page 37 for complete installation instructions. DO NOT install
       this patch BEFORE reading the LEDI Installation Guide.
  
   4.  Delete Routine ^LA27 
  
  
 NOTE: If the site has installed the following Class III software package:
  
 NAME: LAB REPORTS VIA NETWORK MAIL     PREFIX: AUMX
  
 There exists the possibility of confusion in naming of fields in
 the INTERIM REPORTS file (#64.6). The fields in question are:
  #6      DOMAIN NAME
  #695000 DOMAIN NAME
  
 Field # 6 DOMAIN NAME was installed by patch LR*5.2*164
 Field # 695000 DOMAIN NAME was installed previously by Class III package 
 AUMX.
  
 As a courtesy to sites this install will rename field #695000, DOMAIN NAME
 to AUMX DOMAIN NAME if the field is found to exist in the Data Dictionary
 of INTERIM REPORTS file (#64.6). If the field does not exist then during
 the install the following will be displayed during the KIDS install
 procedure.
  
 "Data Dictionary for File #64.6 not installed, failed DD screen."
  
 If this statement appears, the install will still proceed normally and 
 there is no reason for concern.
