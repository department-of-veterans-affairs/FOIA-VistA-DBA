Associated patches: (v)OR*3*160    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*180'

Subject: FHIE ALLERGY REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch is being done in coordination with and in conjunction
  with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)and the Federal Health
  Information Exchange (FHIE) Enhancement Project, which shall
  include data feeds on selected DOD data types for separated military
  members.
  
  This patch also addresses a few CPRS report related NOIS's as
  described below.
  
  A new RPC was exported with patch OR*3.0*160 called ORQQPX IMMUN
  LIST.  This RPC was exported to support Immunizations on the
  Coversheet.  The patch failed to install the RPC on the OR
  CPRS GUI CHART option.  A work around was given to sites to
  manually put the RPC on the option.  This patch will install
  the RPC if it hasn't already been put on the option.
  
  A new report is being added with this patch that will become
  available on the DOD menu within the CPRS Reports Tab,
  and allow remote data to be pulled from the FHIE database.
    The new report is:
      Allergies
  
  Additional documentation will be added to the CPRS documentation with
  the release of CPRS GUI v22, that will show the Allergy report on
  the DOD Menu.
  
  An enhancement has also been made to the VISTA Allergy report
  to include any comments entered in association with an allergy.
  The comments are displayed when a user clicks on a specific
  allergy.
  
  This patch adds and modifies entries to the OE/RR Reports file
  (#101.24) for several DOD reports.
  
  WARNING: Items in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) with entry
  numbers greater than 999 are reserved, and should not be used
  for local enhancements.  If you have any local changes to items
  in this number range, that you want to keep, move them to an
  internal number <1000.  This patch will delete these entries 
  numbers before proceeding with the install.
    
  Changes to entries in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24)
  are as follows:
