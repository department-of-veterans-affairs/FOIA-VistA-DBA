Subject: ASISTS PRINT ISSUES FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will resolve 3 NOIS messages:
  
 1. NOIS FAV-0599-70588  CA1 Date/Time of injury Occurrence 
 2. NOIS FAV-0599-71928  BLOCK 15 PROBLEM-PRINTED CA-2
 3. NOIS FAV-0898-70294  P-SLAVE NOT WORKING 
  
 There are no E3R messages associated with this patch. 
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 1. FAV-0599-70588  CA-1 DATE/TIME OF INJURY OCCURRENCE
  
 Problem:
 When a time of 1200 p.m. through 1259 p.m. is entered for block 10
 (date/time injury occurred) of the CA-1 form, the "x" is showing up in the
 AM block instead of the PM block.
  
 Resolution:
 The coding in routine OOPSPUT1 was modified to distinguish the difference
 between times of 1200am-1259am and times 1200pm-1259pm.  The PM times were
 being viewed as AM times thus placing the "x" in the wrong place.
  
 2. FAV-0599-71928  BLOCK 15 PROBLEM-PRINTED CA-2
  
 Problem:
 When a CA-2 is printed with responses containing more than 3 lines of text
 in blocks 15,16,and 17 the text is incorrectly printed. Currently, the
 text printed in blocks 15 and 16 are reversed with block 15 text being
 printed in block 16 and block 16 text printed in block 15. Additionally
 "See Attached" was not correctly printed in blocks 16 or 17.
  
 Resolution:
 The program was modified to correctly print text in blocks 15 and
 16.  The text "See Attached" now is correctly positioned and
 printed in all blocks.
  
 3. FAV-0898-70294 P-SLAVE NOT WORKING
  
 Problem:
 When printing a CA1/CA2 to a Lexmark printer that is HP PCL Level 5
 (printer control language) compatible, the printer prints the CA1/CA2
 incorrectly.
  
 Resolution:
 Applied code to a number of ASISTS routines that changes the font from
 Century Schoolbook to Times Roman, proportional spacing.  This allows
 Lexmark(HP PCL Level 5 compatible) printers to print the forms correctly.
