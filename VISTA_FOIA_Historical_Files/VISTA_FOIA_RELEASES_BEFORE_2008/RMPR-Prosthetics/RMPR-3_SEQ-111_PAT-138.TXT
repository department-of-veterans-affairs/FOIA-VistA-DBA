 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD184762  ERROR - <MAXNUMBER>EN1+18^RMPREXT
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When checking the DESCRIPTION (#24), DELIVER TO (#25) and REMARKS (#16)
 fields of the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR file (#660). For maximum
 allowable length the $LENGTH checking code was incorrect causing a 
 Boolean check whereby any description with "E: as the second character
 was treated as an exponential value and caused a max number error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPREXT to correct the $LENGTH check syntax to prevent
 the Boolean calculation.
