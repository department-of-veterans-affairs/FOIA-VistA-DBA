Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*131  <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRA*4*9'

Subject: Update for SD*5.3*131 APIs

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will update the Adverse Reaction Tracking software
 so it complies with the request to use the new Ambulatory Care
 Reporting Package (ACRP) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
 The option LIST BY LOCATION OF UNMARKED ID BANDS/CHARTS makes a
 direct read of the scheduling visits file.  This direct read will be
 replaced by using the new APIs that are being released with scheduling
 patch SD*5.3*131.  You must install patch SD*5.3*131 before installing
 this patch.
  
 There are no NOIS messages associated with this patch.
  
 1. Routine: GMRACMR2
    This routine was completely re-written to take advantage of the
 APIs offered in patch SD*5.3*131.  Functionally, the option LIST BY
 LOCATION OF UNMARKED ID BANDS/CHARTS, will work the same.  This routine
 is specifically called when the user asks for the Outpatients over
 Date/Time range (choice #2).
  
 2. Routine: GMRACMR1
    While working on updating Allergies to use the new APIs a coding
 logic problem was discovered in this routine.  Two not operators (')
 were being used with a check for data ($D).  Logically, ''$D is the
 same as a straight $D check so the two not operators were removed.
