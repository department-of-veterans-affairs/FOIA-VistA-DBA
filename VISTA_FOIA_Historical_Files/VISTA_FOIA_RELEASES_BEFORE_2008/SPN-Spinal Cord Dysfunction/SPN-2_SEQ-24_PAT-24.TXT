Subject: IMPROVEMENTS TO REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is an enhancement to the Spinal Cord Dysfunction (SCD) system.
 Its primary use is to provide an informational reporting system that will
 facilitate the cleanup of the SCD database, which is crucial prior to
 migrating the SCD databases to the newly constructed SCI&D (Spinal Cord
 Injury & Disorders) Outcomes web application databases.  A new option,
 Cleanup Report [SPNL CLEANUP REPORT], has been placed under the SCD
 Package Management Menu [SPNL MANAGEMENT]. This option scans the SCD
 Registry and identifies patient records with missing data in relevant
 fields.  Utilizing results from this report, users will be able to edit
 the incomplete records and populate these fields accordingly.
  
 Additional enhancements contained in this patch are:
  
          1. The option "Inquire to a Registry Patient" [SPN REG INQ] has
 been expanded to include computed fields in its display.
  
          2. The Scheduling Replacement API has been called upon to 
 retrieve appointment data, in lieu of obtaining this data from PATIENT 
 sub-file 2.98 and HOSPITAL LOCATION sub-file 44.003.  This change, which 
 will be transparent to the user, has been made on routines SPNFAP1 and 
 SPNLGU.  These routines are used in options "Patients with Future 
 Appointments" [SPNL FUTURE APPTS], "Inpatient/Outpatient Activity" [SPNL 
 INPT/OPT ACTIVITY], and "Inpatient/Outpatient Activity (Specific)" [SPNL 
 INPT/OPT SPECIFIC]
  
          3. Integration Control Number has been added to the Austin-bound 
 HL7 transmission message.
  
  
 This patch also addresses the following NOIS calls:
  
 NOIS Calls.
 ===========
  
   1) NOIS # SDC-0105-60493.  In the report option, Aggregate Outcomes 
 Report [SPN AGG OUTCOMES REPORT], Age (yrs) is sometimes outputted with 
 too many digits, crowding the next adjacent column.  This has been fixed.
  
   2) NOIS # SDC-0105-60496.  The User Selectable Filter "PROSTHETICS" 
 fails to return any data.  This has been fixed.

   Documentation.
   ==============
  
      There will be a new user manual, SCD2_0UM.PDF, and new technical
      manual, SCD2_0TM.PDF, available in the following OI Field Offices'
      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE directory:
  
           Albany
           Hines
           Salt Lake City
  
      Sites will retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
        1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
           download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
           the first available FTP server.  Select Binary as the Transfer
           Type.
  
        2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
           specific server as follows (select Binary as the Transfer Type):
  
          OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
          ---------------   -----------                 ---------

   General Information.
   ====================
  
  This patch should be installed into your production UCI.  It can be
  installed at anytime.  You may experience pauses during installation, but
  install time should not take more than five minutes. No options need to 
  be disabled.  An environment check will be performed to ensure that the
  installing site has installed SPN*2.0*23.
  
  
   Installation Instructions.
   ==========================
  
   Users of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction package may remain online during
   installation.
  
   This Patch is created with Kernel V8 KIDS.  Follow these instructions:
  
     1) Use Packman option 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' to load the KIDS build
          onto your system.
     2) Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
          Routine Summary section are mapped, they should be removed from
          the mapped set at this time.
     3) On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option
          'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all
           routines have the correct checksums.
     4) From the 'Installation' Menu of KIDS, use the option 'Install
           Package(s)'.  Select the package 'SPN*2.0*24' and proceed with
           install.
     5) It is recommended that you answer 'NO' to each of the following
           questions:
              a) 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
                  Install?'
              b) 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?'
              c) 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
                  Protocols?'
     6) If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
              returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
              completion.
