Description:
============

 Patch TIU*1*184 is the TIU portion of the Patient Record Flags (PRF) 
 Project Phase II. 
  
 Two other portions of the project, patch DG*5.3*554 and patch USR*1*27, 
 are being released along with Patch TIU*1*184 in a single KIDS software
 distribution.
  
 This patch includes the informational portion of Patch TIU*1*184, along 
 with installation instructions for the combined software distribution.
  
  
            ************  Warning  ************
  
 Since TIU*1*184 has not been tested against CPRS GUI V25, please do not 
 install TIU*1*184 until you are ready to install CPRS GUI V26 immediately
 after installing TIU*1*184.

 I. DESCRIPTION - Patch TIU*1*184
 ================================
 PRF notes are required by policy whenever a PRF flag is assigned (or 
 continued, etc.), to document the reasons for the action. The Flag
 Assignment Action must be entered first; then a new note is written and
 linked to the assignment action.
  
 Patch TIU*1*184 together with DG*5.3*554 provides functionality to link 
 notes to assignment actions, and TIU*1*184 ensures that every NEW PRF 
 note is linked to a corresponding PRF Flag assignment action.   Note that 
 neither Registration nor TIU software enforces the reverse, that every PRF
 Flag assignment action be linked to a new PRF note. Instead, flag
 assignment actions lacking linked notes appear in PRF Registration reports
 so that they can be followed up manually.
  
 In addition to ensuring that every NEW PRF note is linked to a 
 corresponding PRF Flag assignment action, TIU also provides an action to 
 link existing, unlinked PRF notes (those created before the implementation
 of PRF II) to flag assignment actions. This action is also used to 
 correct existing miss-linked notes.
  
 Authorization for this TIU List Manager action is granted using USR
 Action LINK TO FLAG, exported in USR*1*27.
  
 For linking EXISTING PRF notes, List Manager (LM) action LINK TO REQUEST
 has been changed to read: LINK TO OTHER APPLIC.  Action LINK TO OTHER
 APPLIC appears on menus wherever action LINK TO REQUEST appeared before.  
 The action is context-sensitive: it links a Consult Result to a Request,
 but links a PRF note to a flag.  The LINK TO OTHER APPLIC action is
 available either directly or under submenu action 'Link' on the following
 menus:
  
 Text Integration Utilities (MRT) ... [TIU MAIN MENU MRT]
 Progress Notes/Discharge Summary [TIU] ... [TIU MAIN MENU CLINICIAN]
 Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) ... [TIU MAIN MENU MGR]
  
 Here is an example from the Manager menu:

 Besides these new linking capabilities, this patch updates existing note
 actions such as Change Title, Reassign, TIU Upload, etc., to ensure that
 any NEW PRF notes are linked to Flag assignment actions. Note that addenda
 are NOT linked to Flag assignment actions.
  
 The Detailed Display of PRF notes has been changed to include PRF link 
 information.  The change applies to both the GUI and the LM versions.
  
 The Detailed Display of PRF Titles has been changed to include computed
 field PRF Flag (#.15).  If no flag is associated with a PRF title, the
 field has value '?'.
  
 PRF Titles cannot be used for Interdisciplinary Notes or for Group 
 Notes.  The use of PRF Titles for Group Notes would result in PRF notes 
 which are not linked to flag actions.  As of Phase II, new PRF notes must 
 ALWAYS be linked to flags.
  
 Pre-patch Setup: Titles
 In preparation for Phase II, in which every title used to document 
 clinical reasons for flag assignment is associated with ONE flag and
 every flag is associated with ONE PRF title, sites should examine their
 PRF titles to make sure they have a separate title for each flag, and are
 not using more than one title for any particular flag. Some sites may find
 it best to create NEW titles for Phase II and inactivate the old titles.
  
 Sites should also make sure that titles used to document clinical
 reasons for flag assignment are in the appropriate PRF Document Class.
 If sites wish to use action COPY/MOVE from the Document Definition 
 Utility to move PRF titles or documents, they must do so BEFORE
 installing this patch.  
  
          **** The following actions are no longer permitted ***
               *** once TIU*1*184 is installed ***
  
 - Moving titles into or out of PRF document classes
 - Moving documents en masse from one title to another if one or
   both titles are PRF titles,
  
 Also, you are reminded that Category II titles should be named according
 to the following pattern from the PRF Directive:
   PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY II - [  ] 
 where the bracketed part is determined by the site when it creates its own
 Category II titles. It is best if this part matches the flag name.
  
  
 ONCE THIS PATCH IS INSTALLED, NEW ASSIGNMENTS CANNOT BE MADE FOR PRF 
 CATEGORY II FLAGS AND EXISTING CATEGORY II ASSIGNMENTS CANNOT BE EDITED
 UNTIL A PRF PROGRESS NOTE TITLE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLAG.
  
  
 Pre-patch Setup: Business Rules 
  
                        *** IMPORTANT ***
  ** SITES SHOULD REVIEW THEIR BUSINESS RULES PERMITTING PRF NOTES TO BE
      VIEWED BEFORE INSTALLING V26 OF THE CPRS GUI **
 The flag display in CPRS GUI has been modified in v26 to list Progress
 Notes that have been linked to the selected flag. If the user then selects
 a listed note, the note is displayed if the user has permission to view
 it.
  
 Although permission to view these notes here is identical to permission
 for viewing them from the notes tab, this list is accessible upon patient
 selection, making the list more prominent.
  
 With this in mind,
  
   ** SITES SHOULD REVIEW THEIR BUSINESS RULES PERMITTING PRF NOTES TO BE
      VIEWED BEFORE INSTALLING V26 OF THE CPRS GUI **
  
 Note:  The list of notes is available upon patient selection in the CPRS
 GUI ONLY, NOT from List Manager.
  
 For Linking rules, see the Post-Installation Setup section.

 such as CONTINUE is taken on an existing flag assignment, a note must be 
 written to document the clinical reasons for the action.  Upon entry of 
 the note, it is linked to the action it documents.  Field PRF FLAG ACTION 
 refers to this linked action.
  
 The field contains the Date of the Action followed by the Name of the 
 Action. Example:  3/3/05  CONTINUE
  
 If the PRF note is not linked to a flag action or the linked action date 
 or name cannot be found, the field has value "?".  If the note is not a 
 PRF note (a note with a title under Document Class PATIENT RECORD FLAG 
 CAT I or PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT II), the field has value NA for 
 non-applicable.

 IV. COMBINED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 ====================================== 
  Pre-Installation Notes on USR*1*27:
  * Environment Check:
 The environment check makes sure the current USR ACTION file 8930.8 has 
 the correct actions with the correct IENS.  The last record in the file 
 should be ATTACH ID ENTRY, IEN #25.  If the check finds incorrect actions 
 or IENS, it will abort. If the file already has action LINK TO FLAG, IEN
 #26, the action is overwritten.  If the file is correct and does not yet 
 have action LINK TO FLAG, the patch will install it as IEN 26.
  
  Pre-Installation Notes on DG*5.3*554:
  * Environment Check:
   
      Programmer access is required for installing this patch.
   
      ** NOTE ** -- Prior to installation, the installer must ensure the
                    DUZ(0) node of the DUZ array is set to the "@" symbol.
   
   * Users On the System:
   
      This patch modifies routines used by the Patient Lookup process and
      may affect many users.
   
      It also impacts the following Registration options:
   
        DGPF*
        DG LOAD PATIENT DATA             Load/Edit Patient Data
        DG REGISTER PATIENT              Register a Patient
  
     Therefore, this patch may be installed with users on the system, but 
     should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users
     and to reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
  
   * Post-Install Routine (POST^DG53P554) associates the PRF National Flag 
     with Progress Note Title PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I.
  
 Document Definitions:
 =====================
 Patches TIU*1.0*184 and DG*5.3*554 assume the existence of Document
 Classes PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT I and PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT II, and
 Title PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I.  These Document Definitions were
 created in PRF Phase I by running an option sent out with patch TIU*1*165.
  
 COMBINED Required Builds:
 =========================  
 The following is a list of REQUIRED builds which must be installed 
 prior to installing the distribution:
   
      Prior Required Build(s):
      ------------------------
      TIU*1.0*43
      TIU*1.0*64
      TIU*1.0*77
      TIU*1.0*90
      TIU*1.0*112
      TIU*1.0*144
      TIU*1.0*155
      TIU*1.0*156
      TIU*1.0*157
      TIU*1.0*173
      TIU*1.0*180
      TIU*1.0*182
      DG*5.3*425
      DG*5.3*555
      DG*5.3*623
  
  
 In addition, patch DG*5.3*554 requires both TIU*1.0*184 and USR*1.0*27.
 Patch DG*5.3*554 must therefore be installed last, after the other two 
 patches.
  
  
   COMBINED Installation Instructions:
   ===================================
    This distribution may be installed with users on the system; however, 
    it should be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the
    users.
  
    Installation of this distribution should take less than 15 minutes
    total for all three patches
       
  Installation Steps:
  ===================
   1. Download file PRF_PhaseII.KID to the appropriate directory on 
      your system.  See section COMBINED SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION
      RETRIEVAL, above.
  
   2. Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
      enter: PRF_PhaseII.KID
  
   3. If given the option to run any Environment Check Routine(s), answer
      "YES."  
 
   4. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select the
      Installation menu.

  10. Environment check/Pre-install/Post-install routines TIUPS184, USR27 
      and DG53P554 should be deleted from your system after successful
      patch installation.
  
  
 V. COMBINED POST-INSTALLATION SETUP:
 =====================================
 ONCE THIS PATCH IS INSTALLED, A NEW CATEGORY II FLAG ASSIGNMENT CANNOT BE
 CREATED UNTIL THE FLAG HAS A PRF TITLE ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  
 Record Flag Management options are used to associate flags with titles.
 See Patch Description for DG*5.3*554 or Release Notes.
  
 Authorization for Linking/Re-linking Existing Notes in TIU LM:
 In setting up, sites will need to write business rules for action LINK TO
 FLAG before users can link existing notes created before Phase II of PRF,
 or re-link Patient Record Flag (PRF) notes that have been improperly
 linked.
  
 Your rules will probably bear some resemblance to the rules for linking
 Consults: for Unsigned notes, authors should be permitted to re-link their
 own notes. For signed notes, re-linking should be reserved for a small
 group of users who are familiar with both TIU and Patient Record Flags and
 are qualified to correct chart documents. Retracted notes are
 automatically unlinked upon retraction and must never be re-linked.
  
 Rules will need to be set for both PRF Document Classes: PATIENT RECORD 
 FLAG CAT I and PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT II.
  
 Note that this authorization is required to link/re-link existing notes.
 It is NOT required to link new notes during NOTE CREATION.
  
 Uploading PRF Notes:
  
 Sites intending to upload PRF notes MUST set up new Upload parameters for 
 Document Classes PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT I and PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT 
 II. They should also designate as filing error recipients persons familiar
 with linking notes to actions, for those rare cases where the software is
 not able to link uploaded notes automatically.
  
                         *********************
                        IMPORTANT UPLOAD WARNING
 Do not upload PRF notes as Progress Notes, using the existing upload setup
 for Progress Notes. If your site plans to upload PRF notes, upload
 parameters MUST be set explicitly for Document Classes PATIENT RECORD FLAG
 CAT I and PATIENT RECORD FLAG CAT II. 
  
 Failure to do so will result in new PRF notes which ARE NOT LINKED TO
 FLAGS, and the creation of new unlinked PRF Notes is not permitted in PRF
 Phase II!
                        ***********************
  
 See details in section UPLOADING PRF NOTES of the Release Notes.
  
 Note: PRF notes, like Consults, are always uploaded as original notes,
 never as addenda to existing notes.
