 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD64488 BUT-1204-20495  problem adding Revenue Source Codes
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site was not able to enter the "U" codes through the Enter/Edit 
    Revenue Source Code [PRCA FMS RSC ENTER/EDIT] option when they already
    exist and are active in FMS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The data type of the SOURCE CODE (#.01) field in the Revenue Source 
    Code file (#347.3) has been modified to allow the entry of free text, 
    and the maximum length of the code has also been changed to coincide
    with FMS.
  
    The input transform of the pointer REVENUE CODE (#255) field in the
    Accounts Receivable (#430) file has been modified to store the code in
    the same format as before.
  
 DATA          NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
 ELEMENT       TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 347.3,.01     SOURCE CODE            0;1 FREE TEXT (Required)
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  I $D(X) K:$L(X)>4!($L(X)<1)!'(X'?1P.E) X
 430,255       REVENUE SOURCE         11;6 POINTER TO REVENUE SOURCE 
                                            CODE FILE(#347.3) (Required)
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  D RSC^RCXFMSUR
  
    Also, the [PRCA DISP AUDIT2] print template and two routines RCXFMSUR
    and PRCAFUT have been modified to reflect the change in the Revenue
    Source Code. FMS will only accept uppercase characters so when using
    the Enter/Edit Revenue Source Code [PRCA FMS RSC ENTER/EDIT] option, a
    lowercase character in the code will be converted to uppercase.
