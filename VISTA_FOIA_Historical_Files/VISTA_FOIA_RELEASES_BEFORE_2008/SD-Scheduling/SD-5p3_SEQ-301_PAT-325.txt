Subject: COMBAT VETERAN PHASE II - SCHEDULING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several
  Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
  packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat
  Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation
  From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service
  Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other
  medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of service
  connection.
  
  Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed
  and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this
  type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the
  number of product line dependencies.  Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim
  Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in the
  Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.  It
  provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for the
  combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports cross-referenced
  against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing process.  Phase II
  of this initiative will involve multiple product lines and additional VistA
  only development.  The main goals of Phase II will be to fully automate the
  copayment billing processing of combat vets based on episode of care by
  providing the appropriate questions at check-out as supplied by CPRS.
  
  Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include
  Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated Mail
  Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE),
  Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF.  The National Patient
  Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload
  reporting.  The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
  installed.  It should be noted all patches with the exception of the PIMS
  host file have been previously released and the installation status of
  those patches should be validated at your site prior to installation the 
  PIMS build:

  Product Features
  There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
    a.  Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical
        care
        o  The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those
           veterans who qualify as such per the directive
        o  The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
           audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
           schedulers, etc.)
        o  Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
           was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
           manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC
           conditions, etc.
    b.  Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
        Combat Related
        o  Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to
           identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
           related condition
    c.  Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care,
        prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
        treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless
        changed by pharmacist.
  
  
  This patch distributes the changes to Scheduling and Ambulatory Care
  Reporting (ACRP) in support of the Combat Veteran initiative.
  
  
  New entry in OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION TYPE file (#409.41)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  The post-install routine SD53325 creates the following entry for Combat
  Veteran in the OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION TYPE file (#409.41).  Entry
  number 7 will be used for this table entry and the post-install routine
  ensures that entry 7 matches the nationally distributed value by deleting
  entry 7 if it already exists.
  
       NUMBER (#.001): 7
          NAME (#.01): COMBAT VETERAN
        PROMPT (#.02): Was treatment related to Combat
    INPUT TYPE (#.03): YES/NO
       DEFAULT (#.04): 
      REQUIRED (#.05): YES
  DISPLAY NAME (#.06): Combat Vet (Combat Related)
   ABBREVATION (#.07): CV
          SCREEN (#1): I $$CV^SDCO22(DFN,$G(SDOE),$G(SDDT))
  
  EFFECTIVE DATE (#75 - multiple)
   EFFECTIVE DATE (#.01): SEP 01, 2002
           ACTIVE (#.02): YES
  
  
  Scheduling Changes
  ------------------
  The Scheduling software was modified to store the value of the Combat
  Veteran classification question in the OUTPATIENT CLASSIFICATION file
  (#409.42).  The utility function $$SEQ^SDCO21 (which is documented in
  DBIA #1300-A) was modified to reflect that the Combat Veteran
  classification question should be the second classification question
  asked.  Changes to other utilities the return classification question
  information (DBIA #406 & #1300-A) were not neccessary.
  
  
  ACRP Changes
  ------------
  The patient's Combat Veteran status and Combat Veteran status end date
  have been added to the ZEL (VA Specific Eligibility) segment as sequences
  37 and 38 respectively.  A seventh repetition of the ZCL (VA Specific
  Classification) segment was added that includes the answer to the Combat
  Veteran classification question.
  
  The following error codes have been implemented in file #409.76 'TRANSMITTED 
  OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER ERROR CODE'
  
    Austin        VistA     Description
    ~~~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    733           7330      Combat Veteran is missing or invalid
    734           (7340)    Combat Veteran end date is invalid
    735           (7340)    Combat Veteran end date missing
    (734/735)     7340      Combat Veteran end date missing or invalid
  
  To indicate that this patch has been installed, the name of the
  "AMBCARE-DH293" application in the HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#771)
  will be changed to "AMBCARE-DH325".  This change prevents the processing of
  acknowledgements for encounters that were transmitted using AMBCARE-DG239
  and the encounters will be resent because AmbCare automatically retransmits
  encounters that have not been acknowledged.  Since acknowledgements are
  typically received within a day, this should only affect one day's worth
  of encounters.
  
  To ensure proper purging, the status of all unacknowledged AmbCare messages
  [in the HL7 MESSAGE TEXT file (#772)] will be changed to SUCCESSFULLY
  COMPLETED.  This process is automatically queued to run at the current
  date/time so that patch installation can complete in a timely manner.  A
  message is sent to the installer upon completion of the task.
