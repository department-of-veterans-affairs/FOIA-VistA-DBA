Subject: THIS PATCH ADDRESSES THE MM/YY INPUT FOR PSX ARCHIVE/PURGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem of the wrong month being archived when

 [PSX ARCHIVE SAVE] option and the Purge Archived CMOP Data 
 [PSX ARCHIVE PURGE] option.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently, when a user enters MM/DD at the Month/Year prompt for the
 Archive Monthly CMOP Data [PSX ARCHIVE SAVE] option and the Purge 
 Archived CMOP Data [PSX ARCHIVE PURGE] option, the system assumes
 the user entered MM/YYYY and archives or purges the data from the 
 current year. For example, if a user entered 03/01 with the intention
 of archiving or purging data from March 2001 the system purges or 
 archives data from March 2003 since it assumes current year. 
  
 Resolution:
 ------------
 This patch corrects the problem by forcing entries of MM/YY to be 
 MM/YYYY and this translation is echoed on the screen upon entry 
 (ie March 2001). Then an additional question is asked: "Do you want
 to Archive/Purge data for March 2001?"No //.  The user must respond
 with a "yes" for the archive or purge process to continue.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
  
 Added "EMP" to Dir(0). Added new prompt asking are you sure you want to 
 Archive/Purge this date.  Changes are noted with a comment line 
 containing patch number.

 This patch is exported using KIDS.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the
 impact on users of the CMOP package.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE   
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
   
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSX*2.0*46):
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSX*2.0*46.
   
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
   
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options you 
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
      
         PSX ARCHIVE SAVE              Archive Monthly CMOP Data
         PSX ARCHIVE PURGE             Purge Archived CMOP Data
          
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
