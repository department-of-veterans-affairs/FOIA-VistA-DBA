 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
   BAY-0104-31954: Provider (1-3) summary report is wrong again...
  
 Problem:
 --------
   The site reported an error in the Provider 1-2-3 report. The error reported
   by the site was that more than 1 CPT's workload totals are summarized on a 
   single report line, which is then labeled with the CPT Code of the first 
   value.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
   The Provider 1-2-3 Summary Report ^ECPRSUM1 routine was modified 
   to allow more than one CPT Code with the same description to print on 
   separate lines of the report.
