Subject: REPORT LIST API NAMESPACE ARRAY

Category:

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch fixes a problem in an API used by external applications to
  get a list of reports used on the Reports tab in CPRS.  The array of
  reports is not being returned to the calling application because of an
  improperly named variable.  This patch corrects the problem.
  
  The API call is documented in DBIA #1840 (LIST^ORWRP)
