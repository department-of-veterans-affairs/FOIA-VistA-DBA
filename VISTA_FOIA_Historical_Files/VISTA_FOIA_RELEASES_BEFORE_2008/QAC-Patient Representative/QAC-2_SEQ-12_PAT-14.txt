Subject: ROLLUP NOT RE-TASKING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses a problem reported by NOIS MIN-0800-40324.  A site
 found that if Taskmanager is running on more than one node the Patient
 Representative database rollup might not re-queue itself.  The rollup
 checks to see if the task has already been queued to prevent duplicate
 copies of the task appearing on the task list.  If taskman runs on two
 nodes and if there is a discrepancy between the times on the two nodes
 taskman might think the current job is a future job and fail to retask it.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
