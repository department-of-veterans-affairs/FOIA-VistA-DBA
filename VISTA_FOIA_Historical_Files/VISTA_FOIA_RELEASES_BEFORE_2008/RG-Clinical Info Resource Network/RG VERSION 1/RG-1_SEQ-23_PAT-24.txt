Description: 
============

  RG*1.0*21 is a required build for patch RG*1*24.
   
  RG*1*21 distributed the Add/Edit Point of Contact [RG UPDATE POINT
  OF CONTACT] option.  In routine RGPOC, we used the MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV
  domain name to determine whether or not to transmit the point of
  contact MailMan message to the Master Patient Index (MPI) at Austin.
  This was done to prevent data transmissions from the test account to
  the MPI.  Patch XM*7.1*198, DOMAIN NAME CHANGES, was released on 
  January 15, 2002.  That patch changed the MPI-AUSTIN.VA.GOV domain
  name to MPI-AUSTIN.MED.VA.GOV.  We have enhanced routine RGPOC to
  look in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file for either name.
       
  This problem, reported by Erie, PA in NOIS ERI-0302-20445, is
  corrected in patch RG*1*24.
   
  Facilities do not have to be concerned about point of contact data
  that may have been sent to the MPI after patch XM*7.1*198 was
  installed.  We have included a post installation routine, RGP24PST,
  to transmit the current point of contact data to the MPI.
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
  or subscribers.

  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  The purpose of the post installation routine, RGP24PST, is to
  transmit the current point of contact information from the CIRN
  SITE PARAMETER (#991.8) file to the Data Quality Management team on
  the Master Patient Index.  Data will be sent from the production
  account if patch XM*7.1*198 has been installed.  No data will be
  transmitted from the test account.
   
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 2 minutes.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  None of the routines in the Master Patient Index/Patient 
      Demographics (MPI/PD) package have been recommended for
      routine mapping.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter RG*1.0*24).
   
      (a)  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
           patch is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
   
      (d)  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RG*1.0*24.
     
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  The Add/Edit Point of Contact [RG
      UPDATE POINT OF CONTACT] option should be disabled during the
      installation.
     
  8.  Routine RGP24PST will be automatically deleted from your system
      after successful installation of the patch.
