Description:
============

 This Emergency patch has been determined to be a Patient Safety Issue.  
 The tracking Number is PSI-05-095.
  
 The problems being addressed with patch 116 are as follows:
  
 1.  If a user is jumping between Purchasing and DOR applications, the 
 Patient name will appear with 2 different SSN numbers.  The real SSN for 
 the patient and a second one of an erroneous patient previously selected.
 Data on tab 4 of the 2319 can show data from a completely different
 patient.  The patient name, and all other tabs are correct for the patient
 name displayed, except on tab 4, the listing of what items and HCPCS have
 been issued to the patient.  In addition, cost, dates, and vendor can be
 data from a different patient.  The user also could  receive a "list out
 of bounds" error when this happens.  This will continue until the user
 logs out and logs back in again.
  
 2.  In the GUI purchasing if a PA picks a Common Numbering Series other 
 than the default an undefined error, <UNDEFINED>EN1+12^PRCH7PA1, would
 occur, or the display, The PO was not created
 Error - The Common Number Series exceeds the limit. and the Purchase Order
 could not be completed.  This has been fixed. Remedy HD114903.
  
 3.  It was discovered that a site could delete a record in file 669.9.  
 This should not be allowed.  Updated security instructions have been
 included at the end of this patch. These steps must be done by IRM.
  
 4.  In the GUI 2319 Appliance Transaction Detail screen the HCPCS field
 has been expanded to accommodate the new NIF number being added to the
 HCPCS code.  The display of field 29 INVENTORY POINT of file RECORD OF
 PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR FILE (#660) has been removed to make room for this
 change.
  
 5.  When printing the PO from GUI, if the Purchasing Agent picks a 
 Windows Printer or Windows Fax, The Purchase Order entry for 14. Delivery 
 To: will be blank.  This has been fixed in Routine ^RMPR9P21.  Remedy 
 HD116586
  
 6.  We are including routine ^RMPRPFC with this patch to eliminate the
 error in XDRMERG0 when merging 2 patients.  The merge process errored when
 getting to the Prosthetics package file entry (9.4) and there was no
 executable routine defined.  The bogus Package File entry for Prosthetics
 was a result of a KIDS build for current patches that did not clear the
 Package File "Affects Record Merge" field.
  
 This patch will clear the bogus node that the merge process found in the
 Package File (9.4) for Prosthetics.
  
 7. In Purchasing when a Purchasing Agent Picks a Purchase Card ALL 
 Purchase cards for that Purchasing Agent even if Inactive or Expired will 
 show.  After this patch only those Purchase Cards that are Active and not 
 Expired will be displayed.  Remedy HD116631,HD116361
  
 8.  When entering a CPRS note the formatting was creating a new line every
 13 or 14 characters.  This has been fixed.
