 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. SBY-1203-30300     <UNDEF(ECODE)>RETRAN+4^GECSMUT2:1
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported an undefined variable, GECS("SITE"), error was found
    in their error trap.  It was determined this error was caused by a user
    attempting to exit the Mark Batch for Retransmission [GECS RETRANSMIT]
    option by entering a caret (^) at the "Select STATION NUMBER (^ TO
    EXIT): " prompt.  The software fails to quit the option completely,    
    thus causing the error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine GECSMUT2 was modified to insure the Mark Batch for
    Retransmission [GECS RETRANSMIT] option would exit completely when a
    user enters a caret (^) at the "Select STATION NUMBER (^ TO EXIT): "
    prompt.
