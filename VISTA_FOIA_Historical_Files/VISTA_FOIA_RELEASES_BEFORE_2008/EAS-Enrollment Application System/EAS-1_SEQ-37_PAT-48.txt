Description:
============

 Per VHA DIRECTIVE 2003-069 - This patch MUST be installed before 
 January 1, 2004.  The patch may be installed out of sequence.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for income year 2003 provided 
 in VHA DIRECTIVE 2003-069, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST 
 THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2004 are distributed with this patch.  The 
 updated values for GMT THRESHOLDS file #712.5 are used in the 
 determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year, based 
 on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index.  The geographic based 
 income limits for FY 2003 can be found at: 
 http://www.huduser.org/datasets/il/fmr03/index.html.  
  
 Note that this patch updates the thresholds for the Geographic-Based 
 Means Tests.  Patch DG*5.3*551 will address the annual updates for the 
 Means Test thresholds.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  Installation
 will take less than 30 minutes.  During the installation, the system will 
 appear to hang.  This is not the case.  The #712.5 file is being updated 
 and because the size of the file is quite large, it takes a while.  
 Please be patient and allow the process to complete.  Also, when 
 comparing the transport global to the current system, entries after 
 entries will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are 9,607 
 entries included in the file distributed with this patch and a comparison 
 is done on each of these entries.
