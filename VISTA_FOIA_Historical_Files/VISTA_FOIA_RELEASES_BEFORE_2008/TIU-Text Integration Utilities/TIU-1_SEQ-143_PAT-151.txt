   E3R #15908 TIU ALERTS FOR ADDITIONAL SIGNERS ARE CONFUSING
 
   This patch changes the text for alerts sent to additional signers for 
   completed documents to read:
 
   DOE,JOHN (D1234): <STATUS> <TITLE> available for ADD'L SIGNATURE.
 
   Alert text for EXPECTED COSIGNERS will display UNSIG/UNCOS'D instead of 
   just UNSIGNED to indicate that the document is still UNSIGNED but their 
   COSIGNATURE is required.
 
   Old Alert Text to the EXPECTED COSIGNER:
   PATIENT,X (xxxxx): UNSIGNED GENERIC TEST NOTE available for SIGNATURE.
 
   New Alert Text to the EXPECTED COSIGNER:
   PATIENT,X (xxxxx): UNSIG/UNCOS'D GENERIC TEST NOTE available for SIGNATURE.

   E3R #17281 ALERTS FOR DOCUMENT DEFINITION
   E3R #13842 UNSIGNED PN ALERT TO SIGNER & CO-SIGNER TOGETHER
   E3R #17292 ALERT RECIPIENT BY DOCUMENT TYPE
 
 This patch introduces a new document parameter that will allow sites to 
 specify whether signature alerts should be sent to the author and co-signer 
 simultaneously or sequentially (i.e., alert to co-signer is deferred until 
 after the author has signed).  This parameter may be defined for a class 
 and inherited by all descendants or can be overridden at a subordinate 
 level.
 
 If the parameter REQUIRE AUTHOR TO SIGN is set to NO - The co-signer will 
 get alerted immediately even if the parameter SEND COSIGNER ALERT is set 
 to "After author has SIGNED".  The following diagram displays the possible 
 conditions when and where an alert will be sent.
 
                                          SEND COSIGNER ALERT
                                = IMMEDIATELY    = AFTER AUTHOR HAS SIGNED

 Partial DD:  subDD:  8925.95  field:  .2
 A new Document Parameter has been implemented, SEND COSIGNATURE ALERT, 
 which determines whether the alert to an expected co-signer should be sent 
 after the author of the document has signed or immediately (concurrent with 
 the alert to the author).

 DOCUMENT DEFINITION: EXAMPLE NOTE// 
 REQUIRE RELEASE: NO// 
 REQUIRE MAS VERIFICATION: UPLOAD ONLY// 
 REQUIRE AUTHOR TO SIGN: YES// ??
         This field indicates whether or not the author should sign the 
         document before the expected cosigner (attending).
          
         If parameter is set to NO, only the expected cosigner is alerted 
         for signature. Although the unsigned document appears in the author's 
         unsigned list, and he is ALLOWED to sign it, his signature is 
         not REQUIRED.
          
         If set to YES, then the author is alerted for signature, and if the
         expected cosigner should attempt to sign the document first, he is
         informed that the author has not yet signed.
