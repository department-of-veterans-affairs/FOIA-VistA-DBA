Description: 
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 The purpose of this patch is to separate AUTHORIZATION/SUBSCRIPTION
 UTILITY (ASU) and TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES (TIU) dependencies.
 This is in response to reported problems while configuring ASU when
 TIU has not yet been installed.
  
 Patch USR*1*2 made changes in the way "terminated" users are handled. 
 One of these changes was to screen out 'terminated' users so they
 could not be added as members of a class.  This patch now informs the
 user trying to add a terminated user to a class that they are unable
 to do so because the user they are trying to add has a termination date.
  
 The set and kill logic on the "AUC" and "ACU" cross-references on file 
 8930.3 USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP were modified to become compatible with 
 changes introduced by patch USR*1*2.

 Data Dictionary:
 ================

 where changed so a complete history of a user's class membership will be 
 displayed.

 Detailed Description:
 =====================
 1.  Routines: USRU, USRCLST,USRMEMBR,USRRULA,USRUMMBR
 Created READ^USRU to replace READ^TIUU.  Calls to READ^TIUU were
 replaced by READ^USRU in the other routines.
  
 2.  Routines: USRCLST,USRECLST,USRL,USRLM
 Replaced calls to MIXED^TIULS with MIXED^USRLS.
  
 3.  Routines:  USRCLST,URSECLST,URSMLST,URSULST
 Replaced calls to CENTER^TIULS with CENTER^USRLS.
  
 4.  Routines:  USRLS, USRLM,USRM,USRMEMBR,USRMLST,USRULST,USRUM,USRUMMBR
 Added the function SIGNAME to USRLS.  Replaced calls to SIGNAME^TIULS
 with SIGNAME^URSLS in the other routines.
  
 5.  Routines:  USRLS, USRMEMBR,USRMLST,USRULST,USRUM
 Added the function DATE to USRLS.  Replaced calls to DATE^TIULS with
 DATE^USRLS in the other routines.
  
 6.  Routines:  USRHELP, USRRUL,USRU
     List Templates: USR DEFINE CLASSES, USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY CLASS,
     USR LIST MEMBERSHIP BY USER
 Created USRHELP to replace TIUHELP.  USRHELP had a call to STOP^TIUU so
 we created STOP^USRU.  Each of the LIST TEMPLATES previously used
 PROTOCOL^TIUHELP for the HELP CODE.  This was replaced by
 PROTOCOL^USRHELP.  The routine USRRUL made a call to PROTOCOL^TIUHELP,
 this was replaced by PROTOCOL^USRHELP.
  
 7.  Routines:  USRCLST,USRECLST,USRMLST
 The references to the protocol TIU ACTION SELECT LIST ELEMENT were replaced
 with the USR ACTION SELECT LIST ELEMENT.
  
 8.  Routine:  USRLM
     Protocols:  USR BUSINESS RULE MENU, USR CLASS ACTION MENU, USR CLASS
     MEMBER USER MENU, USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP MENU
 Added the entry point RESIZE to USRLM.  Each of the listed protocols
 used RESIZE^TIULM for the header, this was changed to RESIZE^USRLM.
  
 9.  Routines:  USRMEMBR,USRUMMBR
 Rearranged the screen for a "terminated" user so the person using the
 program will be told that the user is terminated when they try to add
 them to a class.
  
 10.  Routine:  USRLFF
 This is a library of File Functions.  It is mainly for other packages
 that need access to USR data.
  
 11.  Option:  USR CLASS MANAGEMENT MENU
 The code in the header was changed to use CENTER^USRLS instead of 
 CENTER^TIULS.
  
 12.  Data Dictionary: USR CLASS MEMBERSHIP FILE
 Removed the function $$CURRENT^USRLM from the "AUC" and "ACU" 
 cross-references.
