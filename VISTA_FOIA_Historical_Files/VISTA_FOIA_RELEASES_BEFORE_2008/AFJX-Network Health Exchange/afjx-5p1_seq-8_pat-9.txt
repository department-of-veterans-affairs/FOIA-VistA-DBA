  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
    1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation; 
       however, it is highly recommended to do the installation 
       when there are a minimal number of users on the system. 
    2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.
    3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? Yes// <return>, respond YES. When prompted to select
                                              ===
       the option(s) you would like to place out of order, enter the
       following:
  
          AFJXNHEX REQUEST
          ================
  
    4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they
       should be unmapped at this time.
    5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu, you may elect
       to use the following options:
       a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the Transport Global.
       b. Compare Transport Global to the Current System - this option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
          patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
          Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
  
          AFJX*5.1*9.
          ==========
  
    8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 4, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
