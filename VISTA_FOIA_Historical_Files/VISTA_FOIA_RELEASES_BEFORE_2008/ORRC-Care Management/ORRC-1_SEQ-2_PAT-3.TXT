Subject: IMO GEN TEXT ORDERS ON NURSING DASHBOARD

Category:

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is:
 1. Provide a fix to PSI-06-007.  The issue 
 involved with this patch deals with changes made in CPRS GUI 26 
 (OR*3.0*215) that causes information not to be displayed in the Care
 Management application.  With the release of CPRS GUI 26, Generic Text
 Orders that are created during an IMO Ordering Session on an outpatient
 will be displayed under the "Clinic Orders" Display Group instead of under
 "Nursing."  This causes these orders to not display headlights on the
 Nursing Dashboard in Care Management because only inpatient Nursing orders
 currently under the Nursing display group display as a headlight. With
 this patch, headlights will be brought up based on a search for all
 Generic Text Orders in both the Clinic Orders and Nursing Display Groups
 instead of only those under the Nursing Display Group.
 2. We have also addressed another requirement to modify the
 naming convention of our documentation on the ANONYMOUS directories. Due 
 to a namespace issue with another package, we cannot use 'CM' and instead
 shall be using 'ORRC' as a prefix. Accordingly, the .PDF and .zip document
 names have been modified as follows:
  
 Current Name             New Name
 ============             ========
 CMUM.PDF                 ORRCUM.PDF
 CMIG.PDF                 ORRCIG.PDF
 CMTM.PDF                 ORRCTM.PDF
 CMAutoInstall.zip        ORRCAutoInstall.zip
