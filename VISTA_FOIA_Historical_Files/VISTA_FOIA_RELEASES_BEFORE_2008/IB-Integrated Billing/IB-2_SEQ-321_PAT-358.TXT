Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch is to correct issues reported with the release of patch 
 IB*2.0*320, eClaims plus Iteration 2, as described in their respective 
 Remedy Tickets.
  
  
 List of Patch Items:
 --------------------
  
 1. After the installation of IB patch 320, individual non-VA providers 
 are required to have a Social Security Number (SSN) defined. Some sites
 are reporting that they don't have the ability to obtain these outside
 provider SSNs. Previously, individual non-VA providers could have either
 an SSN or an Employer Identification Number (EIN) defined and that was
 acceptable.
  
 It was not the intention of patch 320, to change the existing 
 functionality which is that either the SSN or the tax ID is acceptable 
 for non-VA providers. However, due to the new software's use of the 
 correct qualifiers to represent the EIN and SSN, this existing 
 functionality was inadvertently disabled.
  
 2. In the option Copy and Cancel [IB COPY AND CANCEL], a system error,
 $ZE=<SYNTAX>BR+1^DIE0, occurs when a semicolon is entered into REASON 
 CLONED (#33) field of the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file. During analysis of this
 issue, the same problem was found in the REASON CANCELLED (#19) field of
 the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file in new Multiple CSA Message Management [IBCEMC
 MULT CSA MSG MANAGEMENT] option as well.
  
 3. As part of patch 320, an edit that checked to make sure that required 
 secondary IDs by insurance company were present was strengthened to 
 check all the insurance companies on the claim and not just the current 
 insurance company. The check erroneously caused an edit to occur when 
 the primary insurance is Medicare, the secondary or tertiary insurance 
 has a required ID, and the required ID was manually entered into the 
 claim as opposed to being set up through the Provider ID Maintenance [IBCE
 PROVIDER MAINT] options.
  
 4. As mentioned in the patch description of patch 320, routine IBCEF73 
 had patch 296 listed on line 2 although it was never included with that 
 patch. Since the routine was modified again in this patch, 296 was
 removed from line 2.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no NSR associated with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. 155600    Fee Basis provider SSN/EIN problem
 2. 154378    $ZE= <SYNTAX>BR+1^DIE0
 3. 156736    Problem with Patch 320
 4. 152983    Correct 2nd line of IBCEF73 
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. 155600    Fee Basis provider SSN/EIN problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Software is not recognizing qualifier EI as the Employer Identification
 Number. It is looking specifically for 24 which is the qualifier 
 for Employer Identification when used as a primary ID. Also, most Tax IDs
 are currently stored as qualifier TJ which is only valid as a secondary ID
 qualifier for Lab and Facilities.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified TAX3559^IBCEF73 to look for qualifier EI instead of qualifier 
 24. The post install IBY358PO corrects the qualifiers with individuals 
 using qualifier EI and labs and facilities using qualifier TJ.
  
  
 2. 154378    $ZE= <SYNTAX>BR+1^DIE0
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 User gets a syntax error when a semicolon; is entered into the REASON
 CLONED (#33) field of the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file for the Copy and
 Cancel [IB COPY AND CANCEL] option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the way the DR string was storing data in IBCC and IBCCC1
 to allow semicolon.
  
  
 3. 156736    Problem with Patch 320
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When Medicare was the primary insurance and a subsequent insurance had a
 required ID, the biller would get the following edit if the required ID
 was entered as a one-time ID on this claim.
  
 Required attending/rendering provider ID missing from Secondary 
 Insurance
  
 The code was relying on the current COB even if subsequent insurances 
 were being checked.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added a condition to PROVINF^IBCEF74 to only use the required Medicare 
 Override if the primary insurance was being checked and not rely just 
 on the current COB.
  
  
 4. 152983    Correct 2nd line of IBCEF73
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patch number 296 was mistakenly entered on line 2 of routine IBCEF73 
 when this routine was released with IB patch 320. Routine IBCEF73 was 
 not included with IB patch 296 so this reference is incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Removed reference to patch number 296 from line 2 of routine IBCEF73.

 BILLING PRACTITIONER ID (#355.9) that are pointed to the wrong secondary 
 ID qualifier for Federal Tax ID. For individuals, the ID should have
 qualifier EI. For labs/facilities, the qualifier should be TJ.
