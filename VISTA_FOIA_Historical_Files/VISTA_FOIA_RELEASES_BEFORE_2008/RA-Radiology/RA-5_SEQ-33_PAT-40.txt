Subject: Illegal I/O operation

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product (Dictaphone, 
 TalkStation, PowerScribe) to manipulate Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 
 reports, there are occasions where M WRITE commands are executed.  Since 
 the process of report manipulation is over a TCP/IP socket, these WRITE 
 commands would cause an illegal I/O operation to occur.
  
 This patch will prevent such errors from occurring in the future.

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
  The install time for this patch is less than two minutes.  Since there
  are routine modifications, this patch should be installed when all
  Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
  
  Usage of commercial off the shelf products (PowerScribe, TalkStation, and
  Dictaphone) must be suspended while this patch is being installed.
   
  NOTE:  VA MailMan, VA Kernel, VA ToolKit and VA FileMan patches must be
         current on the target system to avoid problems loading and
         installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
     The installation time for this patch should not exceed two minutes.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
  
      a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
  
      b. Print Transport Global - this option displays the components
         associated with the patch.
  
      c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
  
      d. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu to 
     install the patch.
     
     When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*40.
   
      a. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion
         of Install? //YES", respond NO.

     KIDS 'Install File Print' under the KIDS 'Utilities' menu option.
  
     At the 'Select INSTALL NAME:' prompt enter 'RA*5.0*40' for patch 
     installation results.
