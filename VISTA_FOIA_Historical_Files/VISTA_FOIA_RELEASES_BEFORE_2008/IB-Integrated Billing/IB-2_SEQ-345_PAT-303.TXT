Subject: AR/IB Return Bill Problem for EDI

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one issue. The Edit Returned Bill option on the 
 Return Bill Menu [IB RETURN BILL MENU] has been modified to only allow the 
 editing of a returned bill if it is not an "electronically transmittable" 
 bill. For returned electronically transmittable bills/claims the IB COPY
 AND CANCEL option will need to be used.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD64757 ISA-0105-11565  AR/IB Return Bill Prob for EDI
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the EDI claim has been returned from AR to IB, users can use  
    the option Edit Returned Bill to edit anything on the bill without
    data validation. This is resulting in a mixed bag of errors if they 
    retransmit the claim.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine IBCRTN to not allow editing any of returned claims with
    a rate type which is electronically transmittable. Here are the rate
    types with the type of electronic transmission allowed in the Rate Type
    file (#399.3): 
       REIMBURSABLE INS.
       SHARING AGREEMENT 
       CHAMPVA REIMB. INS.
       CHAMPVA 
       TRICARE REIMB. INS.
       TRICARE.
  
    Not all accounts have all Rate Types, but if a bill is of any of the 
    above Rate Types then it will not be possible to edit the bill if it is
    returned. 
  
    Instead, under the Return Bill Menu [IB RETURN BILL MENU] option, the
    options Edit Returned Bill and Return Bill to A/R will display the
    message below if the user selects the electronic transmission of bill.
  
    "This electronically transmitted bill cannot be selected in this option.
    You must use IB COPY AND CANCEL option to edit this claim data.
    Press RETURN to continue"
