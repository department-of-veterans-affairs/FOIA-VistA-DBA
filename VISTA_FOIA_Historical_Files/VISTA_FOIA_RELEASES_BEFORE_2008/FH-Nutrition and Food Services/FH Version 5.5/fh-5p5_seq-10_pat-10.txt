Subject: Enhance API for DSS Extract

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains the following item:
    
 1) Enhancement to the routine FHDSSAPI, which provides an NFS Application
 Programmer Interface (API) for the Decision Support System (DSS) Extract
 providing inpatient and outpatient data within a given date range.  The
 entry point is DATA^FHDSSAPI(StartDate,EndDate), and data is returned in
 a subscripted ^TMP global.  For details of the API's input and output
 variables and format of returned data please refer to patch FH*5.5*7.
    
 This patch corrects and improves the inpatient data returned by the API by
 more accurately retrieving and screening data within the given date range.
 The inpatient data returned in the original API could not be utilized
 because of difficulties in how inpatient data is stored in the Nutrition
 Person (#115) file.  This patch will correct these problems by more
 accurately returning data for patients who were receiving meals during the
 given date range.
    
 The Nutrition files from which the DSS NUT Extract takes its data, may contain
 records that ideally should not be collected by DSS. These records show an
 admission date in the Nutrition File with no related discharge date thereby
 causing NUT records to be created in the extract when they should not.  This
 may occur when an incomplete or erroneous admission is picked up or a discharge
 date/time is not picked up by the Nutrition Package.  An outpatient NUT record
 is generated because the patient does not have a valid inpatient location.
    
 Remedy ticket 221618 has been filed by Nutrition and Food Service to correct
 this issue.
