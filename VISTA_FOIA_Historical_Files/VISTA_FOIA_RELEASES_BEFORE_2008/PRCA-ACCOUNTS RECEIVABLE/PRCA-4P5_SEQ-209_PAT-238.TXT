Subject: INCORRECT FY IN TR DOCUMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues. The first is regarding the current fiscal
 year 06 setting to the 5287 accounts which caused TR and OP documents 
 to be rejected in FMS. The second is about an undefined error at line
 DEC+8 in routine RCXFMST1 when processing receipts for EDI Lockbox.
  
 Important:
 Once the patch is loaded, sites can regenerate those documents that 
 rejected previously with the wrong BFY 06.  Sites can run the Stack 
 Status Report [PRC GECS STACK REPORT] to find those documents in a 
 rejected status.  Once the documents are identified, the site needs to 
 use either the FMS Regeneration Menu ... [PRCA FMS REGENERATION] for BD 
 and OP rejects or Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] for CR and 
 TR rejects.   NOTE:  If sites corrected these rejects on line in FMS, 
 then do not use the regeneration options.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD114680  INCORRECT FY IN TR DOCUMENTS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that OP and TR documents for FY06 are being rejected 
    because there are no longer 5287 accounts for FY06, they should
    be FY05.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines PRCARFD1 and RCXFMST1 to set the base fiscal year
    to 05 for all 5287 accounts no matter what the current year is.
  
 2. HD113451  Error when processing receipt.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site received an undefined error at line DEC+8^RCXFMST1 when processing
    receipts for EDI Lockbox in the [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCXFMST1 to define the variable which stores the
    fund to avoid the problem.
