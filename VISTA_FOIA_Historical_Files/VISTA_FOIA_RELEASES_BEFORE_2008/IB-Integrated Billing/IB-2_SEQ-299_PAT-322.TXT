Description:
============

 In preparation for the e-Pharmacy software package, insurance
 staff need to match their pharmacy group plans to the appropriate
 VA National Plan.  (For more detailed background information
 regarding this matching process, please refer to the website
 http://vaww.vistau.med.va.gov/VistaU/e-bp/e-pharmacy.htm and
 download the e-Pharmacy Claims Insurance Process User Guide.
 There is other information available at this website that you
 will find helpful regarding the e-Pharmacy project.)
  
 This matching process involves setting up the required BANKING
 IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (BIN)(#366.03,10.02) and
 PROCESSOR CONTROL NUMBER (PCN) (#366.03,10.03) to route the
 claim to the correct processor along with the respective
 BPS NCPDP FORMATS (#9002313.92), commonly referred to as the
 Payer Sheet to ensure the data is in the correct format required
 by the insurance carrier. The BIN, PCN and Payer Sheets are
 maintained at the Austin Automation Center (AAC). In order
 to assist insurance staff with this matching process, a
 website has been developed to store insurance information 
 on pharmacy group plans that have been matched to VA National
 Plans at the medical centers.  Insurance staff will be able
 to use this information to assist them by verifying if other
 medical centers with the same insurance plans have been
 successful in transmitting electronic pharmacy claims and
 which Plan was used.  After installation of patch IB*2.0*322
 and the scheduling of the option Epharmacy Shared Matches Report
 - TaskMan [IBCNR SHARED MATCHES RPT TASK], data from your Vista
 system will be available on the website.
  
 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
  
 On a scheduled weekly basis, VistA systems will create an extract
 file containing the local matches between GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3)
 and PLAN (#366.03) records. The system will send this file via an email
 message, to janus@med.va.gov on the e-Pharmacy production server at the
 AAC.  This is the data that will be used to populate the website.
 The option that generates this file is Epharmacy Shared Matches Report
 - TaskMan [IBCNR SHARED MATCHES RPT TASK].
  
 All PLAN (#366.03) records found that have been matched to GROUP
 INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) at the time the report is run will be
 forwarded to the website.
  
 The intended use of this information is to assist insurance clerks
 in showing the VA National Plan, BIN and PCNs which have been
 used successfully by other sites in the region. A column on the
 report, called DATE_LAST_PAID, shows the most recent date a claim has
 been paid using the current match. If there has never been a paid claim
 relative to that pharmacy group plan/VA National plan match for the site,
 then the field will be empty.  This column allows the sites which are not
 yet submitting claims to still share their BIN and PCN information.
  
 Currently, in order for data to be sent to the website the following
 conditions must be met within the application:
  
 1. The GROUP INSURANCE PLAN (#355.3) must be matched to a
 PLAN (#366.03) record.
 2. The fields INSURANCE COMPANY (#355.3,.01), GROUP NAME (#355.3,.03),
 GROUP NUMBER (#355.3,.04), and PLAN ID (#355.3,6.01) are not empty
 (that is, they have data in their field on the VistA screen).
  
 The insurance staff will access the Plan Match Sharing information by
 accessing the following website.
  
 http://vaww.vitria-edi-test.aac.va.gov:8098/pharmacy/sharing/wpms.html
  
 This application does require the availability of JAVA on the machine
 requesting access to this website.  If you do not have JAVA available,
 contact your IRM service for assistance.  (Microsoft JAVA VM does not work
 with the database in Austin.) There is a free version of Java available
 for download from Sun at http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp.
   
 The staff will be presented with a sign-in screen.
         User name - enter sharing
         Password - enter bin_pcn1
  
 At this point, a screen will come up with 6 buttons at the top of the
 Plan Match Sharing screen.  Click on the button run query to load
 data from the database to your session.  You will be able to see
 data from all medical centers that have transmitted data to the web
 site. See Examples under the Help button for ways to quickly
 narrow the display to plans of interest.
