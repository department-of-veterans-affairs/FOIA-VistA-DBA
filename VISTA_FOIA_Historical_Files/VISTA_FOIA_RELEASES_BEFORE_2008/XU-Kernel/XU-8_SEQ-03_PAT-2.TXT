Subject: KERNEL PATCH 2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  XU*8.0*2
  This is Patch 2 to Kernel version 8.0.  It is in KIDS format and you must
  use the KIDS options to install it. This patch contains Taskman routines.
  You should put Taskman in a wait state and stop the submanager before moving
  the Taskman routines to your Manager account.
  ========================================================================= 
  INSTALLATION: 
   
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
      option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.  
   2. Answer NO to the question: 
      'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?' 
   3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.  
      You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
   4. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Install Package(s)'.  
      Select the package 'XU*8.0*2' and proceed with install.  
   5. After installing this patch, you need to move the following 2 routines 
      from your productions account to the manager account: 
      ZTMS 
      ZTMS2 
   6. In the manager account rename the 2 routines;  i.e.  ZL ZTMS ZS %ZTMS 
      ZTMS     to  %ZTMS 
      ZTMS2    to  %ZTMS2 
   7. If you are a 486 Site, you should now move the 2 routines; %ZTMS & 
      %ZTMS2 to the Manager account on you other CPU's. You also should 
      move the routine XPDIJ from your production account to the production 
      account on the other CPU's.  
   8. Remove Taskman from wait state 
  ========================================================================= 
   
  The Routine XUTMOPT has new entry points to allow other packages to edit
  the OPTION SCHEDULING file (#19.2).
   
  These new entry points include the following:
   
   
  * EDIT^XUTMOPT: Edit an Option
   
  Usage  D EDIT^XUTMOPT(option_name)
   
  Input  option_name:    Name of the option to be edited.
   
  Output none
   
  Description
   
  This entry point allows users to edit an option's scheduling in the OPTION
  SCHEDULING file (#19.2).
   
   
  * DISP^XUTMOPT: Display an Option
   
  Usage  D DISP^XUTMOPT(option_name)
   
  Input  option_name:    Name of the option to be displayed.
   
  Output none
   
  Description
   
  This entry point is used to display the schedule for an option.
   
   
  * RESCH^XUTMOPT: Reschedule an Option
   
  Usage  D RESCH^XUTMOPT(option_name,when_to_run,device_to_use,
  re-schedule_freq,flags,error_array)
   
  Input  option_name:    Name of the option to be rescheduled.
   
         when_to_run:    (optional) 
                         The new scheduled time for the option to run.
   
         device_to_use:  (optional)
                         The device to use for the rescheduled option.
   
      re-schedule_freq:   (optional)
                          The frequency to run the rescheduled option.
   
         flags:          (optional) If the flag is set to an 'L' LAYGO
                         a new entry if needed. 
                         
       error_array:     (optional) Pass by reference. Will be set to -1           
                        if the option was not found.
   
  Output none
   
  Description
   
  This entry point allows an application to set-up the schedule for an
  option.
   
  XUTMR had a bug in the Taskman Requeue code.
  When the question 'Do you wish to change the Device the task goes to:' was
  answered NO. Then it would delete the output device.
   
  XUTMRP and XUTMRP1 are new routines that allow a site to redirect tasks
  that are waiting for a particular device to be rescheduled to a new
  device. The options to invoke these routines can be found on the Taskman
  Management Utilities menu.
   
  There are updates to the DD for the following two fields of the NEW PERSON
  file (#200): VOICE PAGER (#.137) and DIGITAL PAGER (#.138). These fields
  now allow three digit pager numbers.
   
  XUVERIFY had a bug that prevented the use of a '?' in the access/verify code
  pair. This has been fix.  
   
  ZTMS and ZTMS2 have fixes to problems found after K8 release.  That relate
  to leaving IO("C") around, also fixed in Kernel 7.1.  %ZTMS2 also does a
  check to see that %ZTIO and IO are the same. If not record in the TM error
  log and CLOSE %ZTIO and set to IO.  This may be why 2 devices get opened
  at once.
   
  XPDE, XPDIA1 have been updated so that KIDS now supports List Manager 
  templates and Remote Procedures for the Kernel RPC Broker.  
   
  XPDT returns error message if HFS filename is rejected by Device Handler.  
   
  XPDR has been enhanced to allow purging of Build and Install files at the 
  same time.  
   
  XPDDCS will now check that routines in the transport global have header
  nodes.  
   
  XPDIJ doesn't display the message, 'Data already Installed', if there was no 
  data sent.
