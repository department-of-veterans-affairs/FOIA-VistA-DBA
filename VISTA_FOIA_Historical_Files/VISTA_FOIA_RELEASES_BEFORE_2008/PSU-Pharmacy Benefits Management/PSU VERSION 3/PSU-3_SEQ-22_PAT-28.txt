Category:

Description:
============

 Phase II of the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit project requires a new 
 category to be added to each of the set of codes for the Prescription 
 Patient Status and the Provider Type elements of the outpatient 
 prescription transmission of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) 
 extracts.
  
 The new element added to each set of codes is "NVA", which stands for
 NON-VA.
  
 If a prescription in the PRESCRIPTION file #52 has a TPB RX status of 
 "YES", both the Prescription Patient Status and the Provider Type 
 elements in the transmission will be set to "NVA".

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation can 
 take place at any time of day but should not be performed during Pharmacy
 Benefits Management transmissions. This installation will take less than
 one minute.
  
 1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
      routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
      mapped set.
  
 3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
 4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSU*3.0*28):
   a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
      message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
      backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
      DDs, templates, etc.).
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
      the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5.   Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSU*3.0*28.
  
 6.   When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//" respond NO.
  
 7.   When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 8.   If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
