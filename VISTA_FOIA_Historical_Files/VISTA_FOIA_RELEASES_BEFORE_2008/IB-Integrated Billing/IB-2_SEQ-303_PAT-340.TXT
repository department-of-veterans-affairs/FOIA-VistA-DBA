Subject: CANCEL COPAY CHARGES FOR KATRINA VETERANS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch accompanies Accounts Receivable patch, PRCA*4.5*241, in
 support of veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Patch IB*2*340
 can be installed immediately, and it must be installed prior to the
 installation of patch PRCA*4.5*241.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to support the VHA Chief Business Office
 (CBO) request to automatically cancel all veteran co-payments, charged
 to veterans affected by Hurricane Katrina, for treatment provided from
 8/29/05 through 2/28/06.  This action has been approved by the Office 
 of the Under Secretary for Health.  The patch provides two pieces of 
 functionality:
  
 1. Upon installation, the patch will add the new entry 'KATRINA AFFECTED
    VETERAN' to the IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS (#350.3) file.
  
 2. The patch provides the new routine IBAKAT, which will be invoked by
    the PRCA*4.5*241 post initialization process.  This routine will
    identify the co-payment charges specified above that should be
    cancelled, and invoke Accounts Receivable to apply the appropriate
    credit to each veteran's account.
  
  
 Following is a detailed description of the processing that is completed
 when routine IBAKAT is invoked upon the installation of Accounts
 Receivable patch PRCA*4.5*241:
  
 1. If the new entry in the IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS (#350.3) file
    cannot be identified, processing will not continue and an
    error condition will be passed back to Accounts Receivable.
  
 2. Every patient who has had a co-payment charge added to the
    INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350) file since 8/29/05 will be
    analyzed.  If the patient has been flagged as a Katrina veteran
    in the PATIENT (#2) file, but not yet flagged as having charges
    cancelled in the AR DEBTOR (#340) file, the patient's co-payment
    charges will be analyzed.
  
 3. For each patient that meets the criteria in #2 above, the system
    will identify each charge that was created for treatment provided
    to the veteran from 8/29/05 through 2/28/06.  This will include
    Means Test co-payment and per diem charges where either the charges
    'Billed From' or 'Billed To' dates fall within this date range.
    Note that this only includes medication co-payment charges for
    prescriptions that were released between 8/29/05 and 2/28/06.
    Charges that have been cancelled will be ignored.
  
 4. If a charge has been identified that is 'on hold' in Integrated
    Billing and has not yet been passed to Accounts Receivable (for
    example, because the veteran has billable health insurance),
    the charge will be cancelled only in Integrated Billing.  The
    charge will be flagged with the cancellation reason 'KATRINA
    AFFECTED VETERAN.'
  
 5. If a charge has been identified that has been passed to Accounts
    Receivable, the charge will not be cancelled in Integrated Billing.
    Accordingly, the veteran's maximum co-payment billing cap amount
    and Means Test billing clock will not be adjusted.  Instead, only
    the veteran's account in Accounts Receivable will be decreased by
    the amount of the charge.
  
    *** Important Note ***
  
    In some cases, it may not be appropriate to decrease the veteran's
    account in Accounts Receivable, because the veteran's account was
    credited previously due to the receipt of an insurance company
    payment for the same episode of care.  This software will search
    for such credit if the charge was placed on hold before being
    passed to Accounts Receivable.  These credit adjustments to the
    veteran's account will be identified by examining all decrease
    adjustments applied to the corresponding receivable after the
    increase adjustment that represents the billed charge to the
    veteran.  If any such credits are found, they will be deducted
    from the amount of the charge that will be used to decrease the
    veteran's account.
  
 6. The veteran's account will be decreased in the following manner:
  
    a. If the receivable on which the charge was billed has a positive
       principal balance, that balance will be reduced from the
       receivable by creating a decrease adjustment.  If the total
       charge could not be reduced from the receivable, the unreduced
       balance of the charge is saved and processed after all the
       veteran's charges have been processed.
  
    b. If the receivable on which the charge was billed does not
       have a positive principal balance, the total charge amount is
       saved and processed after all the veteran's charges have been
       processed.
  
    c. After all of the veteran's charges have been processed, any
       unreduced charge amounts are then processed in the following
       manner:
  
       i.  All of the veteran's open and active receivables are
           examined to exempt interest and administrative charge
           balances, and decrease receivable balances.  This
           process continues until the entire unreduced charge
           amount is exhausted.
  
       ii. If the entire unreduced charge amount is not consumed
           in the process described in (i) above, a pre-payment
           is created for the veteran in the amount of that balance
           of the unreduced charge amount that was not consumed.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Upon installation, this patch will invoke the post initialization
 process by calling CANRES^IBAKAT.  This process will add an entry
 to the IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS (#350.3) file.  Please note that
 routine IBAKAT is invoked when patch PRCA*4.5*241 is installed,
 and it may need to be executed in the future.  Thus, this routine
 was written in a primary Integrated Billing namespace (IBA*) and
 should remain on the system after the installation of patches
 IB*2*340 and PRCA*4.5*241.
