 Funds package to initiate a database diagnostic analysis. This database
 analysis will be restricted to files relating to the Patient Funds
 package. The new diagnostic report will display a summary of invalid or
 missing data elements. Additionally, the diagnostic report summary has an
 available detail report that provides specific break out information
 regarding all invalid or missing data elements that are displayed in the
 summary. The new menu option for the Database Diagnostic Report
 [PRPF DATA DIAGNOSTIC REPORT] will be listed on the Patient Funds
 Supervisor menu [PRPF SUPERVISOR] and will require the PRPF SUPERVISOR
