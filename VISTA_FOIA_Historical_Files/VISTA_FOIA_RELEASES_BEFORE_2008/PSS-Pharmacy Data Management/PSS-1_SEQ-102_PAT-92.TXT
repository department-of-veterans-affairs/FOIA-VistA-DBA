Description:
============

 This Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) patch is part of the Patient Financial
 Services System (PFSS) project. PFSS patches are being released on various
 schedules. Some patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS
 switch is activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
 implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
 the implementation of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system. The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
 replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON"  will be provided at
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing
 patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:

 Functional Description:
 ======================
 The Charge Description Master (CDM) is an industry standard financial tool
 common to all commercial billing systems and used in virtually every
 private hospital. The CDM is a comprehensive listing of all services
 performed, drugs supplied, or supplies provided in a particular hospital
 along with the value of those services, drugs, items, or charge
 amounts. Each of these entries are represented by a Charge Code, and the
 Charge Code is made up of a Department Code and Service Code. The Charge
 Code for Pharmacy will be the Department Code 160 concatenated with the
 assigned Service Code for the drug. The Department Code 160 will not be
 stored in any files and the Service Code will be established or approved
 by a central CDM Change Control Board (CCB). The implementation of the
 COTS billing system requires the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) or the DRUG
 file (#50) to link the service master Service Code to every Pharmacy
 prescription fill or refill. For drugs that are not associated with an
 entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68), the approved Service Code must be
 populated by the user.
  
  
 Technical Description:
 ======================
 This PDM patch PSS*1*92 provides the following functionality needed to
 support the PFSS project:
  
 1. A new SERVICE CODE field (#400) was added to the DRUG file (#50).
 2. The PSSCOMMON input template was modified to accommodate the new 
    SERVICE CODE field (#400) to be used with the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG
    ENTER/EDIT] option for drugs that are not associated with an entry in
    the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 3. The Integration Agreement (IA) #4533 was modified to include the new
    SERVICE CODE field (#400).

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  
 The PFSS documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany              ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines               ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City      ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Do not install this patch when Pharmacy Data Management users are on the
 system. Installation will take no longer than 3 minutes.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*92):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*92.
  
 6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
