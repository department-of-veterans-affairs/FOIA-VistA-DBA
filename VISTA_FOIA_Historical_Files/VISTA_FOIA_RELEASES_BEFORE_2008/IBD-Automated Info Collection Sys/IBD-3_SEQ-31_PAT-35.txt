Subject: GUI LIST SCREEN SIZE ERROR

Category: 
  - Other

Description: 
============

 The List Errors screen on the AICS workstation software does not display
 the 5 choices for the screened list of errors. In addition, the display of
 error type text does not appear to be the proper size. This patch will
 provide a correctly sized List Errors screen.
  
 To fix this problem a full AICS GUI installation is provided.

 INSTALLATION (M SERVER):
 ------------------------
 There is no installation on the M server for this patch.
  
 INSTALLATION (Client or Workstation)
 ------------------------------------
 This installation is a complete AICS workstation installation and must be
 done on each AICS workstation.  It can be used when setting up new
 installations on a PC without having to previously install other versions.
  
 RPC Broker v1.0 and Paper Keyboard v2.53 must be installed on each
 workstation prior to installing AICS patch IBD*3*35.
  
 The installation on each workstation will install new versions of the AICS
 software (IBDSCAN.EXE and IBDABOUT.DLL) and new master formspec files
 (AICSMSTR.FS and AICSSCAN.FS).  In addition, an update to the Paper
 Keyboard software will be made.  Existing formspec files for each version
 of the encounter form will be deleted and the new ones will automatically
 be loaded as necessary on the workstation.
  
 FILE RETRIEVAL: 
 ----------------   
 The client software file is available on the following CIO Field Offices
 Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability (binary)
 to retrieve the files.

 IBD_3_35.EXE        Client software
                              
 When prompted to create backup copies of all files replaced as an option
 during the installation, answer yes.  When installing this patch, the AICS
 Scanning Workstation application MUST NOT be running on the workstation.
  
 **NOTE:  The Client software is all-inclusive.  It includes all
          previously released workstation patches.  The
          IBD_3_35.EXE file may be run on new workstations or on
          top of a pre-existing version of the software.
  
 1.  Get the IBD_3_35.EXE file using FTP. This must be obtained from the
 appropriate anonymous software directory.  Make sure to set transfer as
 BINARY. Depending on the FTP software, this file might be placed in the
 c:\WINDOWS, c:\, or some other directory.  Notice the FTP client's setup
 should show where downloaded files will be placed. If you cannot find it
 use Win 95's Find File or Folder functionality.
  
 2.  Copy the file IBD_3_35.EXE file into an empty (temporary or scratch)
 directory.  
  
 3.  Run the IBD_3_35.EXE  
  
     Take all the default prompts unless they were overridden during the
 original install of AICS V3.0 on the workstation.
  
     The actual install should take less than one minute.  
  
     If you see this error message:
   
     "CTL3D32.DLL Error, "THIS APPLICATION USES CTL3D32.DLL, WHICH IS NOT
     THE CORRECT VERSION.  THIS VERSION OF CTL3D32.DLL IS DESIGNED ONLY FOR
     WINDOWS NT SYSTEMS"
  
     This is an Internet Explorer DLL, different versions have different
     DLL'S. To work around this issue, click OK every time you receive this
     error message.
  
     NOTE: You may receive this error message more than once, however, this
     does not affect the upgrade process.
  
 4.  When finished, start the AICS workstation software.  If AICS and Paper
 Keyboard both start successfully you can safely delete the IBD_3_35.EXE
 file from the workstation.
