 PATCH OVERVIEW
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat
 Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation
 From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service
 Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other
 medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of
 service connection.
  
 Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed
 and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this
 type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the
 number of product line dependencies. Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim
 Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in
 the Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.
 It provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for
 the combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports
 cross-referenced against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing
 process. Phase II of this initiative will involve multiple product lines
 and additional VistA only development. The main goals of Phase II will be
 to fully automate the copayment billing processing of combat vets based on
 episode of care by providing the appropriate questions at check-out as
 supplied by CPRS.
  
 Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include
 Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE),
 Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF. The National Patient
 Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload
 reporting. The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
 installed:
 Outpatient Pharmacy
     PSO*7*157
     PSX*2*50
 PCE/PTF/Event Capture/Scheduling  - PIMS Host file
     PX*1.0*130
     SD*5.3*325
     DG*5.3*565
     EC*2.0*54
 Integrated Billing
     IB*2.0*247
 CPRS
     OR*3.0*190
 Product Features
 There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
 a. Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical care
    - The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those
      veterans who qualify as such per the directive.
    - The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
      audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
      schedulers, etc.).
    - Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
      was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
      manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC
      conditions, etc.
 b. Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
    Combat Related
    - Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to
      identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
      related condition.
 c. Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care,
    prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
    treatment/service has been deemed combat related by provider or unless
    changed by pharmacist.
  
 This is the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) patch PSX*2*50,
 that provides the functionality changes to accommodate the new copay
 classification called "Combat Veteran".
  
 As part of the Combat Veteran II project, Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch
 PSO*7*157, introduced the COMBAT VETERAN field (#122) to the PRESCRIPTION
 file (#52). This new COMBAT VETERAN field (#122) of the PRESCRIPTION file
 (#52) stores the data related to the copay exemption question, "Is this
 Rx potentially for treatment related to Combat?".
  
 During CMOP transmission of prescriptions, if a prescription is deemed 
 "Billable", the software does a check on the following copay exemption
 fields of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52):
  
 117          MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA
 118          AGENT ORANGE EXPOSURE
 119          IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE
 120          ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT
 121          HEAD AND/OR NECK CANCER
 122          COMBAT VETERAN
  
 If the prescription is identified as copay exempt, the software will 
 transmit "Not Billable" to CMOP.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  
 The VISTA documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
     download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
  
    FILE NAME                          DESCRIPTION
  
    PSO_7_P157_and_PSX_2_P50_RN.PDF    CV Release Notes Phase II
  
 (3) Documentation can also be retrieved from VISTA Documentation Library
 (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will
   take less than 1 minute. There should be no transmissions being 
   processed during the installation.
  
   1.   Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2.   Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time. Currently there are no
        routines that are recommended by the package to be placed into the
        mapped set.
  
   3.   From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
   4.   From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSX*2.0*50):
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSX*2.0*50.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
