 This patch contains the following problem resolutions and enhancements:
  
 [01] Get station number not IEN from $$SITE^VASITE 
      ---------------------------------------------
  
 The $$SITE^VASITE API returns a three piece string, the first piece 
 contains the IEN of the Institution file #4 entry for the site, the middle
 piece is the station name and the third piece is the station number.  The
 HL7 message building process within the Clinical Registries system
 includes the station number within the PID and MSH segment.  Currently the
 station number is being obtained from the first piece returned from the
 $$SITE^VASITE call.  
  
 In many cases the value in piece one (the IEN of the Institution file #4)
 and three (the station number) of the string returned from the
 $$SITE^VASITE call is the same.  However, this is not the case for a small
 number of sites. This patch includes a fix to get the station number from
 the third piece.
  
 The RORHDT02 and RORUTL03 routines have been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is ISH-0802-40597.
  
 [02] Lab results are missed by the Registry Update
      --------------------------------------------- 
  
 Due to an error in the $$ADD^RORUPP02 function some Hep C positive Lab
 results are not checked by the nightly task. Because of this some
 patients were either not added to the registry at all or added much later 
 than required (because of ICD-9 codes).
  
 The $$ADD^RORUPP02 function has been fixed.
  
 During the patch post-install the $$UPDPRMS^RORPOS02 function replaces the
 current value of the REGISTRY UPDATED UNTIL field (#1) of the ROR REGISTRY
 PARAMETERS file (#798.1) with the date of when the first patient was added
 to the registry. This will force the nightly task to rescan the data
 during the next run and add any missed patients to the registry.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is MAC-0502-62631.
  
 [03] Don't send empty RXE's 
      ----------------------
  
 A flaw in the logic of the HL7 builder is sometimes resulting in blank RXE
 segments being sent to the AAC.  The AAC simply ignores these records, 
 which does not cause any major problems but a fix is still necessary.
  
 The RORHL03 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is ISH-0802-40595.
  
 [04] Indefinite wait for registry update subtask(s)
      ----------------------------------------------
  
 If some of the registry update subtasks are not started by Taskman, this 
 causes the $$MONITOR^RORUPD05 function to wait for them indefinitely. This
 is quite an unlikely situation but it has happened at Philadelphia. One of
 the subtasks vanished by an unknown reason and the main task waited for it
 for about a week (until it was stopped manually).
  
 A timeout for subtasks was introduced to fix the problem. If any of the
 subtasks do not start, the main task aborts after a 10 hour wait. The
 timer is ticking only if no subtasks are running.
  
 The RORHDT05 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PHI-0802-20329.
  
 [05] Indefinite cycle in the ESCAPE^RORHL7 function
      ----------------------------------------------
  
 If less than 4 encoding characters (^~\&) are defined in the ROR AAC or
 ROR SITE records of the HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER file (#771), the
 $$ESCAPE^RORHL7 function gets into infinite loop.
  
 The function has been fixed to translate only defined escape characters.
 Moreover, the $$INIT^RORHL7 and $$CREATE^RORHL7 functions have been
 modified to check if all 4 encoding characters are defined and report a
 "Not all four HL7 encoding characters are defined" error if they are not.
  
 The RORHL7 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is DET-0702-41580.
  
 [06] '%DSM-E-STRLEN' error during Data Extraction
      --------------------------------------------
  
 The HL7 segment builders (the routines that generates HL7 segments) store
 records that are too long (more than 255 characters) into the temporary
 HL7 buffer ^TMP("HLS",$J). This caused a '%DSM-E-STRLEN, string too long'
 runtime error. The problem was temporarily fixed by increasing the maximum
 string length for the DSM database volumes.
  
 However, according to the VistA HL7 documentation, the maximum length of 
 those records cannot exceed 245 characters. All data over this limit must 
 be stored in the sub-node(s) of the main entry.
  
 Therefore, a new utility has been developed. The SEGS^RORHL7 procedure 
 splits a long segment into pieces no more than 245 characters in length
 and stores them into the temporary HL7 buffer (^TMP("HLS",$J) by default).
 All segment builders have been modified to use this procedure instead of
 a direct SET command.
  
 The RORHL01, RORHL02, RORHL03, RORHL04, RORHL05, RORHL06, RORHL07 and
 RORHL7 routines have been amended.
  
 The NOIS references for this problem are AMA-0602-72430 and 
 LEX-0602-43143.
  
 [07] Patient IENs are not recorded in the Log
      ----------------------------------------
  
 Some of the error messages recorded in the logs were not associated with 
 the corresponding patients due to an error in the $$PROCESS^ROREXT01 
 function.
  
 The ROREXT01 routine has been amended.
  
 [08] Aborting Patient Report Log's Error
      ------------------------------------
  
 An error is logged on the error trap within VistA when the Patient Report 
 option within the ROR GUI is aborted.  The error was only logged if the 
 user tried to abort the job before it had finished being created (within 
 2 or 3 seconds).   A fix has been made to the software to prevent this.
  
 The RORRP9 routine has been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is SBY-0702-30545.
  
 [09] GUI Gets Caught In A Loop When Entering Dates
      ---------------------------------------------
  
 The Activity Log GUI option goes into a loop when editing the start date 
 when an end date is entered that falls before the start date.   The 
 Activity Log form has a method to check that the end date isn't before 
 the start date. This method event was being run every time the date was 
 changed, causing an infinite loop. To avoid the loop, the code has been 
 changed to only check when the user leaves the start date or end date 
 drop down box.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is ATG-0702-30306.
  
 [10] Relaxed error processing for non-mapped drugs
      ---------------------------------------------
  
 The data extraction routine recorded an error and stopped processing the
 patient data if a drug referenced by the patient data was not mapped to
 the VA Product (the file #50.68).
  
 The error processing has been relaxed. Now if the PSNDF VA PRODUCT
 NAME ENTRY field (22) of the DRUG file (#50) is empty, the data extraction
 routine leaves the second component of the RXE-2 field and the whole RXE-5
 field empty and continues extraction of the patient data.
  
 The RORHL03 and RORHL07 routines have been amended.
  
 [11] Historical Data Extraction ignores DON'T SEND flag
      -------------------------------------------------- 
  
 The nightly data extraction process does not send the data for the
 patients whose registry records (in file #798) have the DON'T SEND field
 (#11) set to 'Yes'. However, the Historical Data Extraction ignored this
 flag. The $$PROCREC^RORHDT04 function has been amended to take the flag
 into account.
  
 [12] Re-send demographic data 
      ------------------------
  
 It has taken much longer than it was anticipated to load the historical
 data files into the AAC database. Therefore, the demographic data resent
 three weeks after package installation (to update the database with
 current information) is being overwritten by the historical data.
  
 The $$UPDPRMS^RORPOS02 function clears the LOCAL DATA RESENT field 
 (#21.04) of the registry parameters in the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file
 (#798.1) during the package post-install. This will force the nightly task
 (the [ROR TASK] option) to resend the demographic and local registry data
 to the AAC.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is ISH-0802-40592.
  
 [13] Remove employees from local and national registries
      ---------------------------------------------------
  
 The $$DELEMPLS^RORPOS03 function removes patients from the Hep C registry
 (during the patch post-install) if they are employees at the local
 facility. It also creates a list of all removed patients.  
  
 This report containing the DFN's of removed patients will be automatically
 sent via MailMan to Dr. Sophia Chang (CHANG,SOPHIA@FORUM.MED.VA.GOV) and
 the person who installs the patch (just in case). Dr. Chang will
 coordinate the removal of these patients from the national registry.
  
 The EXCLUDE EMPLOYES field (#26) has been added to the ROR REGISTRY 
 PARAMETERS file (#798.1). No employees will ever get added to the
 registries that have this field set to 'Yes' (neither via the automatic
 update process nor via the GUI). The $$UPDPRMS^RORPOS02 function assigns
 'Yes' to this field for Hep C registry during the patch post-install.
  
 The RORUPD01, RORUPR, RORUPR1 and RORRP5 routines have been amended.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is PHI-0602-23170. 
  
 [14] Empty VA Alert when Historical Data Extraction is complete
      ----------------------------------------------------------
  
 Due to the '^' character in the text of the message, an "invisible" alert 
 (it was impossible to review it) was sent after successful completion of a
 historical data extraction task. The TASK^RORHDT03 entry point has been
 modified to fix this problem.
  
 The NOIS reference for this problem is NOP-0602-11449.
  
 [15] Update the Drug List for the RX GUI Report 
      ------------------------------------------
  
 The RX GUI report looks for any patients that have been prescribed any 
 drugs from a predefined list held on the DRUG THERAPY LIST multiple (17) 
 of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). New drugs are introduced
 often so this list needs to be periodically updated.  This patch contains
 updates to this list. 
  
 The following National Drug Codes:
  
   000085132704, 000085135105, 000085119403, 000085124201,

   000004199309, 000004201009
   
 are added to the DRUG THERAPY LIST multiple (17) of the ROR REGISTRY 
 PARAMETERS file (#798.1) by the $$UPDRUGS^RORPOS02 function during the
 patch post-install.
  
 [16] Update LOINC List 
      -----------------
  
 The $$UPDLOINC^RORPOS02 function updates the EXTRACTED RESULT multiple 
 (#12) of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1) during the patch
 post-install.
  
 LOINC codes deleted: 
  
   26499, 22297, 12190,  1970, 29615, 17009,  5119,  2339,

 The NOIS reference for this problem is WWW-0702-52004.
  
 [17] Access to the registry files via FileMan
      ----------------------------------------
  
 Security of the ROR LOCAL REGISTRY (#798) and ROR PATIENT (#798.4) files 
 has been enhanced. These files contain patient information and access to 
 them must be restricted.
  
 Now only users having the appropriate security keys can access these files
 via FileMan. This is enforced by the screening logic (the "SCR" node). A 
 user can access records only of those registries that he/she has the keys 
 for (for example, the ROR VA HEPC USER or ROR VA HEPC ADMIN keys are 
 required to access the Hep C registry). Users with the programmer FileMan
 access code (@) can access all records of the files.
  
 This enhancement will be especially important after the addition of other 
 registries (currently under development) to the existing framework.
  
 The ROR, RORACK01, RORDD, RORUPD50, RORUPD51 and RORUTL05 routines have
 been amended.
  
 [18] Maximum size of HL7 messages
      ----------------------------
  
 Due to software limitations, the AAC server has timeout problems with 
 large HL7 messages. To alleviate this, the ROR software has been enhanced.
 Now it allows a limitation for the maximum size of HL7 messages.
  
 When large amounts of data are to be sent to the AAC, the ROR software
 tries to throttle the data flow and redistribute the spike over the
 following days. For example, if there are 20 megabytes of data that should
 be sent to the AAC, the ROR software will not send all the data tonight.
 It will send 5 Mb today, the next 5 megabytes - tomorrow and so on until
 the data flow returns to its sustained level. The level depends on the
 size and activity of the site (usually, the size of the nightly message is
 less than 1 megabyte).
  
 The LAST IEN EXTRACTED (#2.4) and MAXIMUM MESSAGE SIZE (#13.1) fields of
 the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1) control this throttling. The
 post-install routine populates the MAXIMUM MESSAGE SIZE field with value
 of 5 (5 megabytes).
  
 The ROREXPR, ROREXT, ROREXT01 and RORHL7 routines have been amended.
  
 [19] Redundant file access mode
      --------------------------
  
 If the output file already exists when a user tries to start a historical
 data extraction task, the software issues a prompt regarding further
 actions. It is possible to overwrite (O) the file, create a new file with
 a different name (N) or append the data to the existing file (A).
  
 The last option, Append, caused some confusion at the sites because it was
 not fully implemented and, as a matter of fact, it was redundant.
 Therefore, it has been removed from the list of possible options.
  
 The RORHDTAC routine has been amended.
  
 [20] Namespace of the HL7 messages
      -----------------------------
  
 The HLP("NAMESPACE") parameter has been added to the GENERATE^HLMA
 procedure call (as recommended by the HL7 patch HL*1.6*91).
  
 The RORHL7 routine has been amended.
  
 [21] New menu options
      ----------------
  
 The Pending Patients [RORMNT PENDING PATIENTS] menu containing the List of
 Pending Errors [RORMNT PENDING ERRORS LIST] option has been added to the
 [RORMNT MAIN] menu.
  
 This new option prints a report containing a list of patients (referenced
 by the ERROR multiples of the ROR PENDING PATIENT file) having erroneous
 data. The list is sorted by the value of the COUNTER field (number of
 times that an error was recorded for the patient).
  
 [22] Empty station number component of the OBX-15
      --------------------------------------------
  
 The $$GCPR^LA7QRY does not return the station number in the OBX-15 when a
 Lab result references a locally defined testing facility. This causes
 problems at the AAC because station numbers are used to join the records
 of the database tables. Code has been developed which populates the OBX-15
 with the default station number and name (if the original value has no
 station number).
  
 The ROREXT02 routine has been amended.
  
 [23] Status of cancelled HL7 message
      -------------------------------
  
 If the application acknowledgement for a message sent to the AAC is not
 received during the time frame defined by the DAYS TO WAIT FOR ACK field
 of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file, the software cancels the message and 
 records the "Expired 'Awaiting Acknowledgement' flag has been cleared."
 message in the log generated by a nightly task.
  
 To simplify troubleshooting of the HL7 transmission problems, code that
 records status of the cancelled message has been developed. It records the
 message ID, its latest status, the date of the latest status update, the
 error message, the numbers of failed attempts to connect, retries and
 timeouts.
  
 The RORUTL05 routine has been amended.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 20 minutes.
  
 This patch can be installed with VistA users online.
  
 NOTE: The nightly task (the [ROR TASK] option) must not be running
       during the installation.
  
 This patch will force the nightly task to rescan about two months worth of
 data during the next nightly run (see the descriptions of the problem [02]
 for more details). Therefore, it will take more time than a regular
 nightly task.
  
 The nightly task may not finish before the next time at which it is
 scheduled to run. Therefore, "Cannot lock the registries" error messages
 will get filled in the logs until this one-time rescan finishes. You may
 ignore these messages.
  
 Taskman does not need to be STOPPED or placed in a WAIT state.
  
   1. Check the optional parameters of the scheduled [ROR TASK] option.
  
 Some sites have understood the example in the Installation Guide as a
 requirement. If you have entered an "E" for the value of the RORFLCLR
 variable, delete both the value and the parameter (by entering the "@"
 into the VARIABLE NAME field).
  
 If you have not entered a value for the RORSUSP variable, it is
 recommended to do so. This will ensure that the nightly task will not
 interfere with daily activities if it does not finish until morning. Enter
 an appropriate time frame as a value of the parameter (please, do not
 forget to enclose it in the double quotes).
  
 You can provide a value for the RORMNTSK parameter as well but this is not
 required. Please refer to the Installation guide for additional 
 information on this parameter.
