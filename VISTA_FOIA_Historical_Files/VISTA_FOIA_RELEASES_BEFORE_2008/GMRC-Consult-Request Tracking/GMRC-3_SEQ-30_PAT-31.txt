Associated patches: (v)GMRC*3*28   <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRC*3*31'

Subject: IFC COMMENT PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects a problem identified with Inter-facility Consults. 
 The possibility exists that extraneous line(s) of text may be appended to 
 comments of some activities sent from a remote site. Only Inter-facility 
 Consults that have utilized the FORWARD and SIG FINDINGS UPDATE actions 
 at the remote site have the potential of causing this problem. This
 problem can only occur on comments that are greater than one line in 
 length. The patch prevents this problem from occurring in the future.
  
 IMPORTANT: The patch also includes a post-install routine that will
 identify all of the potentially affected consult activities. No cleanup or
 modification should be made to Inter-facility consults that are identified
 with extraneous comments at this time. Patch GMRC*3*32 will outline the
 processes that should be utilized to properly accomplish these
 corrections. This post-install MUST BE RUN MANUALLY by IRM. See the
 Post-Installation section of the description for full details.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be done 
 at off-peak hours.  Installation should take less than one minute.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRC*3.0*31):
          a.  Backup a Transport Global
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        GMRC*3.0*31.
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//' respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 The post-install routine for this patch MUST be run manually by IRM. The 
 output of the post-install should be directed to a printer for review by 
 the Clinical Application Coordinator or a designee. This step is critical
 to ensuring the integrity and accuracy of Inter-facility Consult data at
 your facility. Once printed, the report should be reviewed by Clinical
 Application Coordinators/designee to insure that the comments associated
 with each listed activity appear to be correct. If there is any question
 as to the accuracy of one of the comments, the remote facility should be
 contacted and a comparison done. Note: the comments WILL be accurate at
 the receiving facility. Only comments greater than one line in length at
 the sending (ordering) facility can be affected.
  
 To run the post-install:
  
 1) Proceed to a programmer's prompt
 2) D POST^GMRCYP31
 3) When prompted for a device, enter a valid VistA printer
 4) Ensure the activity comments in the output are reviewed by 
    clinical staff for accuracy
 5) No cleanup or modification should be made to Inter-facility consults
    that are identified with extraneous comments at this time.  Patch 
    GMRC*3*32 will outline the processes that should be utilized to
    properly accomplish these corrections.
