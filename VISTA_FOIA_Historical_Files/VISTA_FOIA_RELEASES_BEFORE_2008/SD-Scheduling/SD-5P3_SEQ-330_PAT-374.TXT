Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*125  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*374'

Subject: CORRECTION FOR DISPOSITION POINTER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 
 This patch addresses a problem associated with patch DG*5.3*459 which removes
 the outpatient workload capture process from two Registration options.
 The Appointment Status Update [SDAM APPT UPDATE] option in scheduling looks
 through the disposition nodes of the patient global. If the encounter pointer
 is missing, this error message,
              **** Disposition without encounter pointer: ****
                        (not included in totals)
 is added to the bulletin sent out at the end of the update. Since the 
 outpatient workload capture data is no longer being captured the bulletin 
 should no longer check for this field. This patch removes this check if the
 appointment date is greater than the date the above DG*5.3*459 patch was 
 installed.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ============== 
 NOL-0504-70835 Remedy Ticket #63925  Problems after installation of DG*5.3*459. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The site reported that after installation of DG*5.3*459 which
 was to eliminate the check out interview, they still get an erroneous
 error message in the bulletin generated by the Appointment Status Update..
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change the business logic so that the error will be included in the 
 bulletin only if the encounter pointer is missing in the Disposition node 
 and the appointment was for a date preceding the installation of patch 
 DG*5.3*459.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed during business hours, but because some 
 options will be out of service during the installation process, it is 
 suggested that it be queued for non-peak hours. Installation will take
 less than 5 minutes.  Users do not have to be off the system.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note: TEXT 
    PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu still display the patch text
    only].
 
  NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
         will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
         need to install the required patch(s) and repeat this step.
 
 2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they should be
    removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
    select the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME enter SD*5.3*374)
    
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
       installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
       Global.
    d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
       components of the KIDS build.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SD*5.3*374.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//', 
    respond NO
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8. When prompted to select the options you would like to place out of
    of order, enter the following:
  
        SDAM APPT UPDATE     Appointment Status Update
  
 9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2 (DSM for Open VMS sites
    only), they should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
    has run to completion.
