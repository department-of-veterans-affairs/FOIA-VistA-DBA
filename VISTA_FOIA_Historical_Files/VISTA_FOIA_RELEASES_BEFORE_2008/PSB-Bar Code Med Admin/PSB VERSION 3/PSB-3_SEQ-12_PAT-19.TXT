Subject: UNABLE TO MARK A PATCH AS REMOVED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  ** This patched addresses issues outlined in PSI-05-064 **  
  
  Problem: Remedy HD68731,HD68804,HD68805,HD88185,HD98274,HD102530,HD103795
     A patch that has been administered to a patient cannot be  
     flagged as REMOVED. When the user selects the medication the
     Administered date and time for the patch to be removed is not
     displayed on the VDL (Virtual Due List).  This problem occurs 
     when the user manually edits the UNITS OF ADMINISTRATION 
     to something other than the word "PATCH".
  
  Corrective Action:
     The Manual Medication Entry option will be modified so the UNITS OF 
     ADMINISTRATION FIELD is non-editable when the default entry is 
     "PATCH".  A change will also be made that will reject the manual entry 
     of the word "PATCH".  These changes will be made to Manual Medication
     Entry [PSB NEW UD ENTRY] screenman form.
