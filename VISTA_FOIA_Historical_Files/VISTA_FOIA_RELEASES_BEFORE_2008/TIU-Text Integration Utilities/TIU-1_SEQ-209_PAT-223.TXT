Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*210   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*223'

Subject: TIU ADMIN CLOSURE TERM CHANGE & POST SIGNATURE ACTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains changes to the Administrative Closure terminology of 
 scanned documents in the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) package. This is in 
 response to the New Service Request #20050905, which requests that the TIU 
 dialog to VistA Imaging be modified to change the term "Administrative 
 Closure" to "Electronically Filed" to minimize user confusion with the HIMS 
 terminology. Documents which are closed by scanning (ie: Advance Directives, 
 Consent forms,etc.) will display the "Electronically Filed" term and 
 documents which are closed manually or administratively will display the 
 "Administrative Closure" term. This terminology change will ONLY apply to new 
 notes and NOT to existing ones.
  
 This patch also incorporates the post signature action for administratively
 closed consult notes so that consult requests can be completed/updated. The 
 post signature action will apply to administratively closed surgical reports 
 as well.
 
 *NOTE: The functionalities contained in this patch will not be visible until
 the Vista Imaging patch, MAG*3.0*46, is released and installed.
