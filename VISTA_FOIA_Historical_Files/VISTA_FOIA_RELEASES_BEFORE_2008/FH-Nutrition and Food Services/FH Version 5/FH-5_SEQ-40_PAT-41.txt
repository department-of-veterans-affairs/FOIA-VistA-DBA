Description:
============

 NOIS calls resolved in this Patch:
  
  WIM-0104-20076  -   UNDEFINED ERROR
  NJH-1203-22146  -   UNDEFINED VARIABLE ERRORS
  BUT-1203-20226  -   UNDEFINED ERROR WHEN FILLING ASSESSMENT   
  CTX-1203-71585  -   Undef variable FHN in Diet Consult   
  NJH-0404-21740  -   dietetican entered assessment for patient k4diedietit
   
 This patch contains the following items:
  
 1. The Print Nutrition Profile [FHASP1] option has been modified to use
 the Scheduling API #3859 to access appointments.  The change is
 transparent to NFS users with one exception; if the inpatient appointment 
 is flagged as collateral, it will no longer print the word 'COLLATERAL' next 
 to the appointment date and clinic name.
  
 2. An undefined variable error occurs in the Enter Assessment [FHASM1] and
 Enter Patient Nutrition Status [FHASE6] options for multidivisional sites
 if the user does not enter a Communication Office.  This problem is fixed
 by exiting the option if a Communication Office is not entered.
  
 3. An undefined variable error may occur in the Clear/Cancel/Reassign a 
 Consult [FHORC4] option for multidivisional sites.  This problem is fixed 
 by initializing the FHN variable.
