Subject: Z06/Z09 VISTA-TO-EDB FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Overview and Background:
 ====================
  
 The release of IVM*2.0*77 and EAS*1*30 (released April 16, 2003) did not 
 correctly place legacy IVM Billing/Collection (ORU~Z09) messages into the
 appropriate outbound queue. All Z09 messages are being placed in the 
 Enrollment Database (EDB) outbound HL7 queue.
  
 Functional Description
 ===============
  
 The software for these patches, IVM*2*78 and EAS*1*33 are not being 
 distributed through the National Patch Module.   These patches are being 
 distributed as a single KIDS software distribution (host file).  This 
 patch contains the informational portion of IVM*2*78 and provides field 
 personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install and implement the 
 patch software.  
  
 Functionality released with EAS*1*33 allows transmission of copay and
 third party billing (and collections for third party) to the EDB under the
 following conditions:
  
      -  The value of the BILL TO (#.06) field of the IVM BILLING
         TRANSMISSION file (#301.61) is equal to or greater than the value
         of the DATE IVM VERIFIED MT COMPLETED (#.25) field of the ANNUAL
         MEANS TEST (#408.31) file.
  
      -  The converted means test is identified by the value, "Z06 MT from
         EBD", in the COMMENT (#50) field of the ANNUAL MEANS TEST
         (#408.31) file.
  
      -  The means test is primary for the income year to which it is
         applicable.

 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
  
 EASPTRN5 has been modified.  A call to an extrinsic has been added to 
 determine whether the Z09 message should be sent to HEC legacy.
  
 EASPTRN1 has been modified.  A new extrinsic function has been added that 
 will return a value of send to EDB (1) or send to HEC legacy (0) when 
 invoked for a specific DFN.
  
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL
 ====================================
 The software for this patch is being distributed in host file 
 IVM_2_P78.KID.  The host file will contain the two KIDS builds.  The 
 first build will be the Income Verification Match patch, IVM*2*78, the 
 second build will be the Enrollment Application System patch, EAS*1*33.
  
 Please refer to the 'Software and Documentation Retrieval' section of the
