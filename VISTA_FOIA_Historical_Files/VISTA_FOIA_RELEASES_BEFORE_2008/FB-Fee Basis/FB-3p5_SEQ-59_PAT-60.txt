Category: 
  - Routine

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 --------------
 1. AUG-0102-32106     USER CANNOT DELETE DATE
     
    Problem:
    -------
    While editing the Fee Basis Authorization from the Enter Authorization
    [FBAA ENTER AUTHORIZATION] option, the user enters an "@" at the
    "Select FROM DATE:" prompt to cancel the authorization, but instead of
    the expected cancel response, a warning of a payment is returned,
    "Cannot delete Authorization because payments already exist!" This
    happens when a payment is made against a Fee Basis authorization and
    then cancelled, leaving no payments in the Fee Basis Payment record for 
    the Authorization being edited. The delete Authorization process is 
    checking the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file for an Authorization number.
    If it is found, the routine assumes there are payments in the Fee Basis 
    payment Record. The delete payment process does not remove the 
    Authorization Number.
     
    Resolution:
    ----------
    When the first payment is added, an Authorization number is also
    added to the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file. When the payments are
    deleted, via the Payment menu [FBAA PAYMENT MENU]/Delete Payment Entry
    [FBAA DELETE PAYMENT] option, the Authorization number is not deleted.
    So when the delete authorization process checks for a Fee Basis payment
    it is mistakenly thinking there are payments. The routine that checks
    for a payment has been modified to look for payment entries instead of
    the Authorization number.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system.  Installation time
 will be less than 2 minutes.
   
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  2.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Disable routine mapping on all systems
      for the routines listed in the Routine Summary.
   
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently
      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
   
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
   
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
   
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
   
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter FB*3.5*60):
       
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
   
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      FB*3.5*60.
   
       a.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
           install? YES//', answer NO.
   
       b.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
           Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer NO.
         
  6.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only) Optional - Include the routines
      distributed with this patch in the mapped routine set.
   
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
      you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
