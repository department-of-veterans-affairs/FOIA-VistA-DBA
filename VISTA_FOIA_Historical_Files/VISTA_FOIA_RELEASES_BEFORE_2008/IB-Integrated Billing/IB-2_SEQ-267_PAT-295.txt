Subject: MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE AND PENSION RATES - CY 2005

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic 
 Pension Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for calendar 
 year 2005. These updates are required for accurate and legal billing.
  
 Note: This patch is being released as an emergency and can
 be installed out of sequence.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. ISP-1204-N0875     MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE AND PENSION RATES - CY 2005
    
 Problem:
 --------
 Every year the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible and
 for the pension threshold rates.  These values need to be updated in the
 associated billing files.  For several years, the sites have been sent an
 informational patch to remind them to update the values manually.
 This can result in delays and mistyped entries.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, for the 2005 rates, will once again automate the update of the
 Medicare and pension threshold values.  A post-init routine is included in
 this patch which will install the new values.  The Technical section below
 contains a list of the new rates which may also be found in VHA Directive 
 2004-071.  If a site has already entered the values manually, the record
 will be overwritten with the national update.
    
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year (CY) 2005 (with an effective date
 of 12/1/04) are defined in VHA Directive 2004-071, dated December 17, 2004
 as:
    
 *   $ 10,162 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 13,309 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 1,734 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
    
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2005 is shown as:
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 912.
    
    
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
    
 File #350.2 -- IB ACTION CHARGE is updated with a new record.  The values
 are as follows:
 .01  KEY                 = "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE"
 .02  EFFECTIVE DATE      = 3050101 (internal form for January 01, 2005)
 .03  IB TRANSACTION TYPE = pointer to "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE" in file #350.1
 .04  UNIT CHARGE, FIXED  =  912
 ==========
    
 File #354.3 -- BILLING THRESHOLDS is updated with a new record.  The 
 values are as follows:
 .01  DATE                        = 3041201 (internal form for 12/01/2004)
 .02  TYPE                        = 1       (for BASIC PENSION)
 .03  BASE RATE FOR VETERAN       = 10162
 .04  BASE RATE WITH 1 DEPENDENT  = 13309
 .05  BASE RATE WITH 2 DEPENDENTS = 15043
 .06  BASE RATE WITH 3 DEPENDENTS = 16777
 .07  BASE RATE WITH 4 DEPENDENTS = 18511
 .08  BASE RATE WITH 5 DEPENDENTS = 20245
 .09  BASE RATE WITH 6 DEPENDENTS = 21979
 .1   BASE RATE WITH 7 DEPENDENTS = 23713
 .11  BASE RATE WITH 8 DEPENDENTS = 25447
 .12  ADDITIONAL DEPENDENT AMOUNT = 1734

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
    
 This patch can be installed at any time.  Users do not have to be off
 of the system.  Installation time will be less than 1 minute.  
    
    
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  2.  Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in
      the routine summary.  (DSM for open VMS sites only)
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in
      your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
    
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
    
            Edits and Distribution ...  
            Utilities ...
            Installation ...  
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                               ---
    
      1      Load a Distribution
      2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
      3      Print Transport Global
      4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
      5      Backup a Transport Global
      6      Install Package(s)
             Restart Install of Package(s)
             Unload a Distribution
    
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter IB*2.0*295):
    
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed. It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
    
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package IB*2.0*295.
    
      a.  The installation routine will check the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file
          (#354.1) for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
          thresholds.  If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
          UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status
          may change due to the new rates.  
          Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print
          At the DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device.  An entry is
          required and the HOME device is not allowed, neither is the 
          p-Message device (this will abort the install).  You must 
          choose a valid printer. You need not queue the report since the
          patch will do so automatically.
      b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
          install? YES//', answer NO.
      c.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
          Options, and Protocols? YES//' answer NO.
    
  6.  Optional - Include the routines distributed with this patch in the
      mapped routine set.  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
    
      NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if you 
      wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
    
  7.  Optional - You may delete the environment check and post-init 
      routines IB20E295 and IB20P295 after installation has successfully
      completed.
