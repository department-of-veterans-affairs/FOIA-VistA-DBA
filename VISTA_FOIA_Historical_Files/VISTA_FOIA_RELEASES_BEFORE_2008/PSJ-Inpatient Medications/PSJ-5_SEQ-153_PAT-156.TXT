Subject: PROBLEM WITH BACKDOOR OVERRIDING SCHEDULE TYPE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Before Installing Please Note: The patch should be installed when NO Inpatient 
 Pharmacy users are on the system.
  
 This patch addresses Remedy ticket HD71221, potential PSI-05-076.
  
 A provider entered a medication through CPRS with the intent
 of the order being administered on a QD0600 continuous schedule.  
 The medication ordered, however, had a default schedule type 
 of PRN.  Therefore, when the pharmacist finished the order 
 backdoor, the default schedule type of PRN overrode the 
 Provider's intent of a continuous schedule.  Because the
 medication was finished as PRN, the patient missed a dose 
 of the medication.
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS/REMEDY TICKETS
 ==============================
 HD71221/ERI-0105-21819     Potential PSI-05-076 - No alert to schedule type.

 PROBLEM OVERVIEW & RESOLUTION
 =============================
  
 Problem
 -------
 The intent of the provider is not being followed with respect to
 the schedule type for a medication if that medication has a
 default schedule type defined in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 The resolution for this issue is to not allow backdoor pharmacy
 to override the Provider's incoming intended schedule type from
 CPRS even if a default schedule type is defined for the 
 medication in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
  
 **NOTE** The one exception is if the schedule type defined
 in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM File is "Fill on Request".
 Fill on request orderable item schedule types WILL still
 take precedence over any inbound CPRS schedule type.
 This exception was initiated by the test sites, and was
 approved by the Inpatient Meds Workgroup.
  
  
  
 TECHNICAL RESOLUTION
 ====================
  
 GTST^PSGOE6 is responsible for determining the schedule type for an order 
 inbound from CPRS.
 Check to see if there is a default schedule type of "Fill on request",
 and if so, the routine will quit while the variable ST has a value or "R".
 Otherwise, check for the other 4 schedule types (one-time, on call, 
 PRN, and continuous), and use Continuous as the default.
