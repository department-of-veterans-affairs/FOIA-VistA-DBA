Subject: MPI/PD EXCEPTION MESSAGE SCREENING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This is an emergency patch that should be installed immediately by
  all sites that have installed Clinical Information Resource Network -
  Patient Demographics and Master Patient Index (CIRN PD/MPI) version 1.0.
  
  RG*1.0*3 is a required build for patch RG*1*11.
   
  1.) A problem has been identified wherein a CIRN PD/MPI processing
  routine was incorrectly executed by a non-CIRN PD/MPI application
  (e.g., commercial off the shelf (COTS) interface).  The processing
  routine generated a large number (e.g., thousands) of exception
  messages to the CIRN EXCEPTION MGT mail group on FORUM.  The RGHLLOG
  routine has been modified to check for the RG, VA and MPI name spaced
  applications and screen out all others.  If either the sending
  application or receiving application falls into the above namespaces,
  the exception message will be delivered to the CIRN EXCEPTION MGT
  mail group.
   
  2.) The definition of the XMDUZ variable has been changed.  
  Previously, it was not static.  It was set to "HL7 MSG#:"
  concatenated with the internal entry number (IEN) of the record
  in the HL7 MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION (#773) file.  Now, XMDUZ is
  defined as "MPI/PD exception notification".
   
  Integration Agreement (IA) number 3244 has been created to cover
  this functionality.
