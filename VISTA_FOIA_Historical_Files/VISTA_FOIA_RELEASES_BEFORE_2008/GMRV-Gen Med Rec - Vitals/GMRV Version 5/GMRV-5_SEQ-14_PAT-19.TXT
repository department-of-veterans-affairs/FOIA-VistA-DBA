 This patch will place all of the GMRV namespaced options out of order. 
 This patch is the first step towards shutting down the Vitals/Measurements
 package roll and scroll interface. Future patches will remove the GMRV
 namespaced code (options, routines, etc) and provide new Application 
 Programming Interfaces (API) to replace the existing GMRV namespaced APIs.
  
 The Vitals User and Vitals Lite Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are not 
 affected by this patch.
  
 The following options will be placed out of order:
  TPR B/P Ht. Wt. and Pain [GMRV ADMISSION V/M]
  Display Vitals Category/Qualifier/Synonym Table [GMRV CAT/QUAL TABLE]
  Change Date/Time Taken [GMRV CHANGE V/M PARAMETERS]
  Circumference/Girth [GMRV CIRCUMF/GIRTH]
  Cumulative Vitals Report [GMRV CUMULATIVE V/M]
  CVP (Central Venous Pressure) [GMRV CVP]
  Latest Vitals Display for a Patient [GMRV DISPLAY V/M]
  Edit a Vital/Measurement Entered in Error [GMRV ERROR EDIT]
  Print Vitals Entered in Error for a Patient [GMRV ERROR REPORT]
  Detailed B/P and Associated Pulse [GMRV EXT B/P]
  Pulse Oximetry [GMRV O2SATURATION]
  Pain [GMRV PAIN]
  Vitals/Measurements Results Reporting [GMRV PRINT MENU]
  Pulse [GMRV PULSE]
  Display Administration Schedule File [GMRV SCHED FILE DISP]

  Vitals/Measurement Data Entry [GMRV V/M ENTRY MENU]
  User Configurable Combination [GMRV VMCONFIG]
  Change Default Qualifiers for Temp./Pulse [GMRV VMQUALTY]
  Enter/Edit Vitals Qualifiers [GMRV VMSITE]
  Weight [GMRV WEIGHT]
  Vitals/Measurement [GMRVMGR]
  Create Vital Measurement Quick Order Protocol [GMRVORQUICK]
  
  
 After the release of version 5 of the software, the roll and scroll 
 interface was no longer documented in the manuals. Therefore, there are 
 no documentation changes for the Vitals/Measurements manuals.
  
 There are no routine changes.
  
 The NUR*4.0*40 patch is installed with this patch. Both patches are
 bundled together in the VITL5_P19.KID host file. Please see the NUR*4.0*40
 patch for a description of what options it places out of order.
