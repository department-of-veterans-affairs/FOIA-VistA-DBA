Subject: EWL STATISTIC REPORT BUG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When running the SD WAIT LIST STAT REPORT, the '# NOT REMVD' column total
 is always the same regardless of the date range requested.  This is 
 because of a bug in the report where the date range requested is ignored
 and all wait list 'NOT REMVD' entries from the beginning of time to
 present are being included.
