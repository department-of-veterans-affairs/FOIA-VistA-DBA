Subject: VIC POW/PURPLE HEART ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
   In response to requests from veterans' organizations, the Health
   Eligibility Center (HEC) requested that the Veteran ID Card (VIC) be
   enhanced to allow display of former Prisoner of War (POW) and/or
   Purple Heart (PH) designation.
  
   The enhanced VIC may be used in some states by the veteran as proof
   of POW eligibility when requesting state POW-related benefits.
  
   This software release in support of the above functionality requires the
   installation of both a VistA server patch and an upgrade to the Patient
   Image Capture (PICS) workstation software.
  
  
 II. SERVER FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   1. VISTA TO PICS INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS
  
     a. Veteran Demographic Data Retrieval
     
        Two additional data elements have been added to the demographic data
        elements retrieved by the Patient Image Capture (PICS) workstation
        from the VistA Registration database to indicate that the veteran
        is a former POW and/or Purple Heart recipient.
  
     b. Card Print Release Status evaluation
  
        The Card Print Release Status evaluation has been enhanced to generate
        a Card Print Release Status of "H"old when a veteran's Purple Heart
        claim verification is pending.  A veteran's POW status is determined
        as part of the Enrollment, therefore the POW status is pending when the
        veteran's Enrollment Status is pending.  The existing functionality
        generates a Card Print Release Status of "H"old when the Enrollment 
        Status is pending.
  
  
   2. MONITORING OF VIC REQUESTS ON "H"OLD MODIFICATION
  
      The VIC Background Processing [DGQE BACKGROUND PROCESSING] 
      option that re-evaluates VIC requests with a "H"old Card Print
      Release Status has been modified to include a check of the Purple Heart
      claim verification status.  Note: No changes were required to accommodate
      POW pending status, since the POW pending status is tied to the Enrollment
      Status and evaluation of the Enrollment Status is existing functionality.
  
  
   3. VISTA TO NCMD HL7 INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS
  
      The VistA HL7 message that is transmitted to the National Card
      Management Directory (NCMD) when a "H"old status is resolved has
      been modified by the addition of POW and Purple Heart indicators.
  
  
 III. PICS WORKSTATION FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   1. PICS WORKSTATION DISPLAY
  
      Two additional data fields, have been added to the 'Additional 
      Information' section of the PICS Workstation screen to display
      the POW and Purple Heart status.
  
  
   2. QUEUE FILE MANAGER
  
      Queuing of data on the workstation was implemented to handle network
      disruptions and is automatically de-queued by the PICS application.
      A new menu item, 'Queue File Manager...', has been added to the
      'Patient' menu in this release of the PICS VIC II workstation software.
      The Queue File Manager displays a window that lists all queued VIC
      requests on the workstation and allows the user to manage the queue
      entries.
  
  
   3. CANCELLING PENDING REQUESTS
  
      A new 'Cancel Request...' menu item has been added to the 'Patient'
      menu and a new 'Cancel Request' button has been added to allow a
      pending request to be cancelled from the PICS workstation. 
  
  
   4. VISTA IMAGING TRACKING ID
  
      A new 'Upload Picture...' menu item has been added to the 'Patient'
      menu.  This new function allows the Veteran's picture to be uploaded
      to VistA Imaging without submitting a VIC request.  PICS constructs
      an identifier for the picture to uniquely identify the photo being
      stored.  This photo identifier will also be stored in the National
      Card Management Directory.
  
      Note:  A very low percentage probability exists that the Tracking ID 
      may exceed the current 30 character restriction in VistA Imaging,
      preventing the storage of the picture in VistA Imaging.  The user
      will be notified by a dialog box displaying: "Unable to save photo to
      VistA Imaging".  The problem may only occur in sites where the user's
      NEW PERSON (#200) file record number (DUZ) combined with the site
      station number exceeds 12 characters.  The 30 character restriction
      is being addressed in a future VistA Imaging patch.  Please log a
      Remedy ticket to the VistA Imaging support team if this problem is
      encountered.
