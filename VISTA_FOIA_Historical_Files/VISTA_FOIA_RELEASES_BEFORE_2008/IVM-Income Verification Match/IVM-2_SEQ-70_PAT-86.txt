Description:
============

 This patch is being released as an EMERGENCY patch to immediately reduce 
 the unnecessary retransmission of ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages to the HEC.  
 Please install before the next run of the IVM BACKGROUND JOB.
  
 The Inbound ORU~Z07 HL7 Message filers at the HEC are unable to process 
 the volume of messages being received in a timely manner.
  
 As the acknowledgment to the ORU~Z07 messages is frequently not returned 
 within three days, the site software re-transmits the ORU-Z07 causing 
 duplicate and even more backlog at the HEC.  By extending the resend date 
 from 3 days to 14 days, this should allow the HEC to process the inbound 
 workload without any extensive duplication.  
  
 This will significantly decrease the incoming ORU-Z07 volume and allow 
 the HEC to process ORU-Z07's at a more efficient rate.
  
 The over-loaded Inbound Message Filers issue at the HEC was originally 
 addressed with patch IVM*2.0*66 (Extend Z07 resend date 3 to 14) and was 
 released on October 22,2002.  The patch set the date to re-transmit 
 non-acknowledged ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages from three to fourteen days.
  
 The issue of ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages was believed to have been corrected. A 
 subsequent patch IVM*2.0*81 (FIX QUERY RESPONSE FOR FUTURE MT) was 
 released on July 24,2003 which included changing the re-transmit date for 
 non-acknowledged ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages back to three days.
  
 The original issue of ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages not processing in a timely 
 manner at the HEC has not been resolved.  This patch IVM*2.0*86, is 
 returning the date to re-transmit non-acknowledged ORU~Z07 HL7 Messages 
 from three to fourteen days.
