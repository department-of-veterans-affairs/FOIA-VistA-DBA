Subject: CLAIMS MANAGER READ ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch adds some error trapping code to avoid a problem in the
 Claims Manager interface that could cause users to be forcibly logged
 out.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
      
 1. PRE-0902-60489        Claims Manager  freezing screen 
      
    Problem:
    --------
    When submitting a bill to the Claims Manager system, the user would
    occasionally experience a 'frozen screen'.  The problem was that a
    <READ> error had occurred and the job had halted.  There was no way
    for the user to know this had happened so they sat waiting for the 
    screen to move on to the next prompt.  Eventually they would have to
    log back in, restart their session and submit the bill again.
    The <READ> errors appear to occur randomly and fairly infrequently.
    The problem does not appear to be data-related since the same bill 
    transmits just fine when resubmitted.  The problem seems to be most
    prevalent on Cache/NT systems but has occurred at least once on a
    DSM system (see ASH-0103-30446).
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrects part of the issue by adding some error trapping
    code that returns the user to the menu rather than halting their job
    when the <READ> error occurs.
    It is not within the scope of this patch to resolve any issues such as
    network timing, tcp/ip setup, hardware configurations or any other
    system level communications issues between the host computer and the
    Claims Manager system which may be the source of the error.
           
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
      
 1.  Changes are made to routines IBCIUT3 and IBCIUT4.
     IBCIUT3
       A new subroutine, ERRTRP, releases the tcp/ip port and creates the
       message "A SYSTEM ERROR HAS BEEN DETECTED AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATION".
       A new level is pushed on the error trap stack and the $ETRAP system
       variable is set to call the new ERRTRP subroutine.
     IBCIUT4
       A new error type, "Fatal System Error" is added to the P1 function.

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
      INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
      
  2.  Disable routine mapping on all systems for the routines listed in
      the routine summary.  (DSM for open VMS sites only)
      NOTE:  If the routines included in this patch are not currently in
      your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
      
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
      [XPD MAIN]: 
      
            Edits and Distribution ...

          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when

          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
