Subject: UPDATE MT STATUS TO ENROLLMENT PRIORITY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 This patch provides enhancements to the Automated Information Collection
 System (AICS) software to no longer display Means Test (MT) Category on
 the Encounter Form but display Enrollment Priority and Requires MT Co-Pay
 (yes/no).
  
  The following NOIS issues are also addressed in this patch:
  
  Technical Description:
  ======================
  
  A. This patch uses supported APIs from the Registration package
     to facilitate the display of Enrollment Priority and Requires MT
     Co-Pay (yes/no) information.  Displayed as follows.
                      EP: _ Co-Pay:_
  
  B. This patch will add two new AICS encounter form (EF) blocks to
     the AICS Tool Kit.  A summary description of each new encounter form
     block is listed below:

                                                      Requires MT Co-Pay.
  
 C. It is important to note that all existing AICS Tool Kit encounter
    form blocks will remain intact and will NOT be overwritten by the new
    encounter form blocks added with this patch.  These encounter form
    blocks will be added to the AICS Tool Kit and are available for sites
    to add to their existing encounter forms.
  
    1) To facilitate locating the encounter forms containing the existing
       encounter form blocks, a mail message with the subject 'Patch
       IBD*3*43 Encounter Form Block Report' will be generated when the
       patch is installed and will be sent to the patch installer.  The
       mail message contains a report that will assist the user by
       providing the following:
  
       a) A summary list containing the old encounter form block name and
          new encounter form block name.
  
       b) Each detail line contains:
          1. The existing encounter form block and encounter form where
             the block is located.
          2. The clinic and division using the encounter form.
  
  
  Implementation:
  ===============
  
  A. Instructions to replace an existing encounter form block and add a
     new encounter form block from the AICS Tool Kit to an encounter form:
  
     1) Locate the clinic (and division if necessary) of the encounter
        form using the mail message 'Patch IBD*3*43 Encounter Form Block
        Report' generated by this patch and described in section C above.
  
     2) In the Encounter Forms menu option [IBDF ENCOUNTER FORM], select
        EE  Edit Encounter Forms [IBDF EDIT ENCOUNTER FORM].
  
     3) In the Edit Encounter Forms menu option, select  
        ED  Clinic Setup/Edit Forms [IBDF CLINIC SETUP/EDIT FORMS], and
        enter the clinic name that is using the encounter form.
  
     4) A list of encounter forms used by the clinic will appear.  At this
        point, a backup copy of the form may be created by using the
        CF  Copy Form [IBDF COPY FORM BLOCK] action to copy the form to
        another form name.  Choose the defaults presented, and when asked
        'How should the clinic use the form?', select 'Reserved for Future
        Use'.
  
     5) Edit the desired form by selecting  EF  Edit Form [IBDF EDIT FORM]
        and the form number on the list (i.e. EF=1 if there is more than
        one form on the list).  The encounter form will be built and will
        display on the screen.  Find the encounter form block you wish to
        change on the encounter form and note its placement (i.e. the
        block's row, start and end columns, and how many lines high it is).
        This will help to prevent creating overlapping encounter form
        blocks on the form.
  
     6) When correct placement of the block has been determined, delete the
        old encounter form block by selecting  DB  Delete Block [IBDF 
        DELETE A BLOCK]. Add the new encounter form block by selecting
        AT  Add Toolkit Block [IBDF DISPLAY TOOLKIT BLOCKS FOR ADDING]
        and choosing the desired Tool Kit Block from the list presented.
  
     7) After the new encounter form has been created, the backup copy of
        the encounter form may be deleted using the  DS  Delete from Setup
        [IBDF DELETE FROM CLINIC SETUP] action.
