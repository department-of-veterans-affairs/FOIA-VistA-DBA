Description: 
============

 The software for this patch, IB*2.0*202, and associated patches, 
 DG*5.3*481 and IVM*2.0*67, are not being distributed through the National
 Patch Module. These patches are being distributed as a single KIDS
 software distribution (host file), associated with the patch DG*5.3*481.
 This patch contains the informational portion of IB*2.0*202 and provides
 field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install, and
 implement the patch software.
  
  
 Special Note:
 -------------
  
 The GMT conversion did not process a small group of veterans whose 
 enrollment records are either PENDING; NO ELIGIBILITY CODE IN VIVA or
 PENDING; ELIGIBILITY STATUS IS UNVERIFIED Enrollment Status.  This patch
 will release any bills that are being held for these patients even though
 a GMT Threshold has not been applied to the Means Test.  The HEC will
 provide a list of affected patient to each site so that any billing 
 implications can be addressed manually.
  
  
 Overview
 --------
 This patch is the final part of the Geographic Means Test software. It 
 must be installed now that the GMT Conversion process is completed.
  
 With the installation of the patch the following actions will be 
 performed:
 - All GMT Conversion related functionality will be removed from the IB 
 package;
 - All temporary GMT Conversion related data will be removed from database;
 - All 'Held (rate)' and 'Incomplete' Inpatient Means test charges will be 
 recalculated for the patients, who did not pass the conversion process;
 - All 'Held (rate)' charges will be released off hold and passed to the 
 Accounts Receivable package;
 - A report with released/recalculated charges will be created and sent 
 using MailMan to members of the "MEANS TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP" (usually
 this is the "IB MEANS TEST" Mail Group).
  
 After the patch is installed, Inpatient Means Test charges will no longer 
 be placed ON HOLD because of unknown rate.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 The patch IB*2.0*202 provides the following functionality:
  
 1) The patch modifies the following IB software to remove all GMT 
 Conversion related code:  
   MEANS TEST UTILITIES (IBAUTL4);
   MOVEMENT EVENT DRIVER INTERFACE (IBAMTD1);
   GMT-RELATED UTILITIES (IBAGMT);
   CANCEL/EDIT/ADD PATIENT CHARGES (IBECEA21, IBECEA3);
   ESTIMATE MEANS TEST CHARGES (IBOMTE);
   RELEASE CHARGES AWAITING NEW COPAY RATE (IBEMTO) - Disabled;
   INTEGRATED BILLING - A/R INTERFACE UTILITIES (IBRUTL).  
   
 2) The post-install procedure for the patch will process all patients 
 who have had Inpatient Means Test charges since the GMT Effective date 
 (October 1, 2002). If any of the patients have not passed the GMT 
 Conversion process, and still have IB Charges placed ON HOLD because of
 unknown rate, the procedure will release the held charges. In addition,
 all previous Incomplete and Held (rate) charges will be adjusted for
 patients who have the 'GMT COPAY REQUIRED' status.
  
 3) The post-install procedure for the patch will create a bulletin
 with the list of processed patients, including their copayment
 status and number of released/adjusted charges. The bulletin will be 
 printed to the current device (monitor) during the install time, and also
 will be sent by MailMan to the current user and to members of the "MEANS
 TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP" (usually this is the "IB MEANS TEST" Mail Group).
  
 4) If an error happens when passing the charge to the AR package, the 
 post-install procedure will send a MailMan message concerning the error 
 to members of the "MEANS TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP" with the error details, 
 recommending reviewing that charge manually. There will be a separate 
 MailMan message for each charge that causes an error (e.g. the AR 
 package returns bad result code).
  
 5) The patch removes the temporary GMT Conversion related global nodes 
 from the database:
   ^IB("AGMT")
   ^IB("AGMTP")
   ^XTMP("IB GMT CONVERSION")
  
 6) The patch provides a minor alteration to the wording of the Means Test
 Billing Bulletin, to avoid user confusion. The previous wording was 
 "This patient is now billable as a Means Test copay patient". That was
 confusing in case of patients with "GMT COPAY REQUIRED" status. The
 new wording is "This patient is now billable for medical care copayments".
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 There are nine modified routines in this patch and one new routine.
  
 The patch IB*2.0*202 provides the following functionality:
  
 IB20P202 - New routine.
 The routine contains the post-install cleanup procedure - one of the 
 most important parts of the patch IB*2.0*202.
  
 The post-install procedure POST^IB20P202 will process all patients who 
 have had Inpatient Means Test charges since the GMT Effective date
 (October 1, 2002). If any of the patients has not passed the GMT
 Conversion process, and therefore, still have IB Charges placed ON HOLD
 because of unknown rate, the procedure will release the held charges. In
 addition, all previous Incomplete and Held (rate) charges will be adjusted
 for patients who have the 'GMT COPAY REQUIRED' status. 
  
 The post-install procedure for the patch will create the report with the 
 released/adjusted charges and their corresponding patients. The report
 will be sent by MailMan to members of the "MEANS TEST BILLING MAIL GROUP"
 (usually this is the "IB MEANS TEST" Mail Group).
  
 At the end, the post-init procedure will remove the following temporary
 GMT Conversion related global nodes from the database:
   ^IB("AGMT")
   ^IB("AGMTP")
   ^XTMP("IB GMT CONVERSION")
  
  
 The patch modifies the following routines due to the completion of GMT 
 Conversion process:
  
 IBAGMT:
  
 The API call $$ISGMTYPT^IBAGMT(DFN) is modified to return:
   '1' - GMT rate should be applied, or 
   '0' - GMT rate should not be applied.
   '-1' - (Unknown GMT Threshold status) has been removed, and will 
 no longer be supported by this function.
  
  
 The API call $$HOLD^IBAGMT() will be disabled. Now that the GMT 
 Conversion has finished, no Inpatient Means Test charges will need 
 to go ON HOLD (RATE). The function will perform no action and will always 
 return '0' (false).
  
 The API call $$RELHOLD^IBAGMT(DFN) will be disabled. Although, it will
 still exist in the IB package, it will perform no action. If called, it 
 will return an error code indicating that it has been disabled.
  
 IBAUTL4,IBAMTD1:
  
 These routines were modified to remove the code responsible for creating 
 the temporary global nodes (cross-references): ^IB("AGMT") and
 ^IB("AGMTP"). Also the patch removes the code that releases Inpatient
 Means Test Charges before the GMT Effective Date.
  
 IBECEA21, IBECEA3, IBOMTE:
  
 The warning messages related to patients with "UNKNOWN GMT STATUS" 
 (Potentially "GMT COPAY REQUIRED") will be removed from these routines, 
 as they no longer needed.
  
 IBEMTO:
  
 The 'Release Charges Awaiting New Copay Rate' menu option will be turned 
 off by the patch, since the functionality will no longer be needed. The 
 menu option will not be disabled (it will not be modified in any way), 
 but the associated routine IBEMTO will only print the message "This 
 option is no longer available.", and quit.
 Therefore, the routine provides exactly the same logic, as the patch 
 IB*2.0*179 (GMT IB Part 1). This routine is associated with the 'Release 
 Charges Awaiting New Copay Rate' menu option.  It will be modified to 
 print the message, "This option is no longer available", then quit.
  
  
 IBRUTL:
  
 The procedure $$HOLD^IBRUTL() will no longer call $$HOLD^IBAGMT since no 
 charges will need to be held for any GMT related reasons.
  
 IBAMTBU2:
  
 The Means Test Billing Bulletin will be modified to provide correct 
 wording, as follows: "This patient is now billable for medical care 
 copayments."
