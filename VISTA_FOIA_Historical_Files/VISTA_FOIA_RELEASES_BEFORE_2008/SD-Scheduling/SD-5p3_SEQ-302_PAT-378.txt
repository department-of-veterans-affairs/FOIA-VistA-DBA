  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

 longer being automatically removed from the list of encounter errors.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. RIC-0604-20121   INCOMPLETE ENCOUNTER ERRORS
       
    Problem:
    --------
    Prior to the release of patch SD*5.3*323, when a user corrected errors
    using option Correct Incomplete Encounter [SCENI IEMM ERROR 
    CORRECTION], the system would automatically update and remove the 
    corrected error from the list of encounter errors. Since patch 
    SD*5.3*323 was released, the corrected errors are now remaining on the
    error list until the user selects Action:  "Retransmit Encounter",
    which then removes the error(s) which were corrected.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new line of code was introduced with patch SD*5.3*323, which was
    causing the system to refresh the screen and prematurely quit before
    the automatic update logic was performed.  This line of code will be
    removed from the routine so that this particular piece of logic will
    function as it did prior to patch SD*5.3*323.  However, this change
    will not effect the fix that was made with patch SD*5.3*323.
    
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
 1. RIC-0604-20121   INCOMPLETE ENCOUNTER ERRORS
    
 When a clerk uses option Correct Incomplete Encounter [SCENI IEMM 
 ERROR CORRECTION] to correct an error, the system is suppose to 
 automatically update and remove the corrected error from the encounter 
 error list.  However, the following line of code which was introduced 
 with patch SD*5.3*323, at linetag CE+33^SCENIA1, prevents the 
 automatic update:
    
    I $D(SDOK),SDOK=1 D REFRESH^VALM Q
    
 The above line of code will be removed from routine SCENIA1.
