Subject: KATRINA FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 Due to hurricane Katrina, and the suspending of payments
 for those veterans affected, from September 1, 2005, to
 February 28, 2006, the Central Business Office (CBO) has
 requested that a report be created to generate a summary of
 the amount of funds that will be suspended for those sites
 who have Katrina affected patients.
  
 This patch contains a new option, the Emergency Response Report 
 [RC EMERGENCY RESPONSE REPORT].  This report has been placed under the 
 Management Reports [PRCAD MANAGEMENT REPORT MENU] menu, located 
 under the Report Menu for Accounts Receivable ... [PRCAD REPORT 
 MENU] menu option, which is under the Clerk's AR Menu ... [PRCA 
 CLERK MENU].
  
 Sites should run this report to get a detailed or summary display
 of the amount of funds that will be suspended due to Katrina
 affected patients at their sites. The summary report will list, for the
 site, the total balance (principle + Interest + administrative)
 amounts of all of the affected veterans, the number of affected
 veterans and the average amount suspended per veteran. The detailed 
 listing will display, by affected veteran, the bills whose payments 
 are currently suspended, the principle amount, the interest and 
 administrative amounts, and the total amount per bill and total 
 amount per patient.
  
 The report will display the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the AR DEBTOR
 file (#340) next to the name of the veteran.  This was added to help in 
 data validation and for quick debtor lookup when using the backwards 
 accent.
  
 Each site will be required to run the summary report and send
 the report to your VISN Business Implementation Manager, who will compile 
 the results and send them on to Stephanie Mardon and Josie Boisvert
 of the Central Business office.
