 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. 85745		Problems accessing form 10-2319
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When in option Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR PRINT 2319] users cannot
    get to CORRESPONDENCE LETTER when the patient has zero or one appointments.
    In "^RMPRF02" it bails out if '$D(%).  "%" seems to have been last set
    in ^RMPRPAT0 when listing appointments. % gets set on the third
    appointment. We are not having the correspondence letter PROMPT even come 
    up if the patient has zero or 1 appointment.
 
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine was updated to not check for the amount of appointments on the
    patient account.
  
 2. Add on task to be proactive.
    
    Problem:
    --------
    It was determined that the % variable being used in the Correspondence
    letter routines need to be changed to a name space variable.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routines were updated to use a name space variable RMPRAA68 instead 
    of a system variable.
