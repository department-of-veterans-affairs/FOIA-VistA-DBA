Subject: HIPAA Confidential Communications

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Overview
 --------
  
 Patch IB*2.0*206 represents the Integrated Billing portion of the HIPAA
 Confidential Communications project. It makes necessary changes to the IB
 functionality to ensure that all IB-related patient correspondence will be
 sent to confidential mailing address, when applicable.
  
  
 Functional Description
 ----------------------
  
 The patch IB*2.0*206 provides the following modifications, related to the 
 HIPAA Confidential Communications requirements.
  
 1) RX Copay Exemption Test Reminders will be printed, indicating the 
 patient's confidential mailing address, if applicable.
  
 2) The patient's UB Forms will use the confidential address for mailing, 
 if applicable. UB Forms are being sent to the bill mailing address, which
 is determined at the time the bill is created. With this patch, IB will
 populate the bill's mailing address with patient's Confidential Address,
 when applicable: if the patient is responsible for the bill and has an
 address for Confidential Communications active for billing-related
 correspondence at the time the bill was created.
  
 3) The patient's HCFA 1500 Forms will use the confidential address for 
 mailing, if applicable. In the IB package, HCFA 1500 Forms are being sent
 to the bill mailing address, which is determined at the time the bill is
 created. With this patch, IB will populate the bill's mailing address with
 patient's Confidential Address, when applicable: if the patient is
 responsible for the bill and has an address for Confidential
 Communications active for billing-related correspondence at the time the
 bill was created.
  
 4) The mailing address for the third party bills is determined at the time
 the bill is created. The bill mailing address is stored with the bill and
 may be changed for every bill individually, using menu option [IB EDIT
 BILLING INFO], SCREEN #3 "PAYER INFORMATION". The changes will affect only
 this particular bill. The SCREEN #1 "DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION" does not
 show the patient's Confidential Address, because the Confidential Address
 cannot be edited within the IB package.
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
  
 The IB package uses the ADD^VADPT call to determine the patient's mailing
 address. This call is external to the IB package. With the HIPAA
 Confidential Communications project this API call will be modified to
 return the patient's confidential address (if applicable) in addition to 
 the patient's permanent address.
  
 This patch will analyze the output of ADD^VADPT as follows:
  
 a. If the API returns the node VAPA(12) as NULL, or zero - the
 confidential address will NOT be used, because it either does not exist,
 or is not active for the current date.
  
 b. If the local array VAPA returned by the API does not have the node 
 VAPA(22,3) defined, or if the node is defined, but the third piece of the 
 string is not equal to "Y" - the confidential address will NOT be used,
 because the confidential address is not applicable to the billing-related
 correspondence.
  
 c. For all other cases the patients Confidential Address will be used for
 billing-related correspondence.
  
 The following routines were modified by this patch:
  
 1. IBARXEL - this routine was modified to use the zip code from the 
 confidential address, when applicable, to sort reminding letters.
  
 2. IBARXEPL - this routine was modified to print the patient's 
 confidential address, when applicable, on RX Copay Exemption Test
 Reminders.
  
 3. IBCU5 - this routine contains the procedure EN^IBCU5, which is being 
 called by the compiled data dictionary of file #399 "BILL/CLAIMS". This
 procedure will be triggered when a record of file #399 is created/modified
 to populate the bill's mailing address fields (fields 104-109,121). With
 this patch, the procedure will populate the bill's mailing address with
 the patient's confidential address, if applicable. This mailing address 
 will be used when printing UB or HCFA forms.
  
 Developer Initiated Issue
 -------------------------
  
 During the development of this patch, an existing minor problem was
 discovered. Because the problem affected the functionality of this patch,
 it was identified and completely resolved. The essence of the above
 problem was as follows: When editing a bill (file #399 BILL/CLAIMS), for
 example, using menu option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO], MCCR SCREEN 3, when
 changing the Party Responsible for the Bill from INSURANCE to PATIENT
 these cross-references were triggered if the following sequence: 
 - "AML1" was triggered and populated the Mailing Address with patient's
 address (that's correct). That happened because the field #.11 ("WHO'S
 RESPONSIBLE FOR BILL?")  was changed to "p" - Patient. 
 - "AML2" was triggered after that and filled the Mailing Address with the
 address of the Insurance Company back again (that was incorrect). That
 happened because the field #135 ("BILL PAYER CARRIER") is not empty.
  
 The issue was resolved by modifying the code for the "AML2" 
 cross-reference (subroutine MAILA^IBCU5) to avoid populating the Mailing
 Address of the bill with the address of the Insurance Company in cases,
 when the party, responsible for the is "p" - Patient, or "o" - Other
 Party. 
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes.
