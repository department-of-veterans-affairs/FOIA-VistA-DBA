Subject: STOP SNOMED CODING OLD AP REPORTS FROM SENDING ALERTS 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ==========================================================================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*324 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*324 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*324 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
 ==========================================================================
  
  
 This patch updates the LRAPOLD (Enter old anat path records), to not 
 send ENTRY/RESULT notifications. Since this processes the entry of old
 reports, no notification should be sent.
  
  
 Problem:
 =======
 The site reports sporadic alerts being sent to invalid physicians, as a 
 result of Snomed coding old AP reports, since the install of OR*3.0*210 
 and LR*5.2*311. After LR*5.2*311 the process was going to LAB^ORB3LAB to 
 send notification of lab entry / results, when a Lab Anatomic Pathology 
 or Surgical Pathology is entered in the LAB Data file # 63. Since this is 
 a process to enter old AP records the variables used to send the 
 notification are not set up. So in most cases nothing was sent even when 
 the notification process was incorrectly activated. But some times 
 variable leftovers would be in place and cause bogus notifications to be 
 sent. 
  
  
 Solution:
 ========
 The software that sends notifications was updated to check if this is the
 LRAPOLD process and if so, do not go to LAB^ORB3LAB, to send the entry /
 result notification.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   4.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   5.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   8.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*324'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
   9. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
