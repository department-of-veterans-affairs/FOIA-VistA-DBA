         Voluntary Service Staff Instructions for patch ABSV*4*31
  
  
  After patch ABSV*4*31 is installed at a site, the Voluntary Service staff
  can begin the data cleansing process. The Systems Implementation (SI)
  group will give specific instructions to the Voluntary Service staff
  regarding the timing and other particulars of the migration.
  
  This process will start when the patch is received by the site and should
  be completed not later than 2 weeks before the sites scheduled conversion
  date.
  
  The patch installs a new menu on the Volunteer Timekeeping Activity menu.
  The new menu looks like this:
  
  Voluntary Data Migration Menu
  
    PREP   Prepare for Transition to VSS
    VAL    Validate Existing Data
    PRNT   Print Results of Data Validation
    VOL    Master Volunteer Edit
    DAIL   Daily Time Edit
    OCC    Occasional Hours Edit
    SEND   Send Voluntary Data to VSS
        **> Locked with ABSV MIGRATION
  
  (Note: the Send option will appear only after patch 32 is installed.)
  
  This menu is locked with the already existing ABSV MGR Security Key; so,
  only holders of that key will be able to run these options.
  
  Briefly,
  
    PREP option does some initial setup for your site and sends information
  that is used to establish your site on the VSS centralized server.  Run
  this option once only.
  
    VAL option checks your existing data and creates a report of entries
  that contain inconsistent data that can be corrected before the data is
  sent to the new system.  This option can be run as often as you like.
  
    PRNT option displays the results of the Validate option.  It can be run
  as often as you like.
  
    VOL option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
  a problem with the Volunteer information.
  
    DAIL option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
  a problem with Regular Hours information.
  
    OCC option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
  a problem with Occasional Hours information.
  
    SEND option sends the data to the new system.  It should be run only once
  unless SI instructs you to run it again.
  
  
  PREPARE FOR  TRANSITION TO VSS
  
  VSS will contain information about your Voluntary Service.  If your site is
  multi-divisional, it will contain information about each division to which
  Volunteer Hours are recorded.  Most of the information about your Voluntary
  Service and its staff will entered by Voluntary Service personnel using the
  new VSS web interface.  However, some data is needed for initial setup of
  your site.  The main purpose of the Prepare for Transition to VSS option is
  to gather this preliminary information and to send it to the people who will
  do the initial data entry.
  
  Following is the dialog you will see when running this option.
  
  Select Voluntary Data Migration Menu Option: Prepare for Transition to VSS
  
  You are starting the process that will move 
  Voluntary Timekeeping data to the new 
  Voluntary Service System application.
  
  First, information about your site will be collected.
  Your Volunteer Daily Time file will be scanned to find 
  all sites referenced.  This will take some time.
  
  Done.
  
  Your primary site number is 605
  Hours are recorded to the following sites:
                     605
  
  The option has looked through your Volunteer Daily Time file and identified
  all the sites (or institutions) to which regular volunteer hours have been
  recorded since 10/1/1996.  Displayed are your primary station number and
  the station numbers of all the sites for which hours were found.
  
  If this information appears to be incorrect, answer the following question
  "NO" and contact SI for further instructions.  Otherwise, answer "YES" and
  proceed.
  
  Is this site information correct? YES
  
  Now an entry for your site is made in a new file that was installed on your
  system by patch 31, the Voluntary Migration Log file.  The data recorded
  when running the migration options is stored in this file.
  
  
  Making an entry in the Voluntary Migration Log file.
  
  You will be asked for information about each station to which hours are
  recorded.  In this example, only one station is involved.  If your
  multi-divisional site has more than one station, answer the questions for
  each station even if the answers are the same.
  
  
                     Add information for Station Number 605
  
  STATION NAME: Loma Linda Test
  VISN: 22
  STREET ADDRESS LINE 1: 1 Hospital Way
  STREET ADDRESS LINE 2: <RET>
  CITY: Loma Linda
  STATE: CA
  ZIP CODE: 99999
  USER ADMIN'S LAST NAME: Boss
  USER ADMIN'S FIRST NAME: Big
  USER ADMIN'S MIDDLE NAME: B.
  USER ADMIN'S NT USERNAME: vhamaster\vhaisfbossb
  
  The first seven questions are self-explanatory.  
  
  The questions about the User Administrator refer to the lead person at
  your site. That person will be responsible for entering site data and
  setting up other local users.  Often, it will be the Voluntary Service
  Chief.
  
  It is very important that this person's NT Username is entered correctly.
  You must enter both the domain and the username separated by a "\".
  
  Next you are asked for the e-mail address of the recipient of this
  information.  The message is sent via MailMan to a Microsoft Exchange
  address.  SI will provide you with the necessary e-mail address. You can
  also send the message to local MailMan recipients.  In the following
  example, John Smith is the user.
  
  Your local IRM must assure that mail can be sent successfully to the
  med.va.gov domain.  The sending of this message will be a test of that
  domain, which will also be used when the actual data is sent.
  
  Sending a message containing information about your site.
  Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message: first.last@med.va.gov
  Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message:
                                 SMITH,JOHN (use your own name here)
  Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message: <RET>
  Message sent.  Message number: 8250639
  
  This completes the preparatory option on the MUMPS system.  SI will
  contact you after your site has been initialized on VSS and the new
  system is ready to recieve your data.  
  
  You can now proceed with the review of your local data.
  
  
  VALIDATE EXISTING DATA:
  
    PREP   Prepare for Transition to VSS
    VAL    Validate Existing Data
    PRNT   Print Results of Data Validation
    VOL    Master Volunteer Edit
    DAIL   Daily Time Edit
    OCC    Occasional Hours Edit
    SEND   Send Voluntary Data to VSS
  
  Select Voluntary Data Migration Menu Option: Validate Existing Data
  
  Data that will be moved to the new Voluntary Service System database
  will now be checked for consistency.
  
  The result will be recorded in the Voluntary Migration Log File.
  You will have the opportunity to print these results.
  
  The data validation process will review all of the entries that will be
  moved from your VistA VTK system to the new VSS server.  A report will be
  made containing each entry that has incorrect or inconsistent data.
  You can use that report to correct entries so that a complete set of data
  is moved to the new system.
  
  Entries that are reported as containing a problem will not be migrated to
  the new system unless the problem is corrected in your data.
  
  Because there are many records involved, running this option may take some
  time.  Particularly time consuming will be the validation of the Volunteer
  Regular Hours.
  
  A dialog indicating progress is presented as the validation goes on.  When
  the check of each file is done, the number of entries with errors is
  displayed.
  
  
  Do you want to proceed? YES
  
  Creating list of all Volunteers with hours after Sept. 30, 1996.
  Done.
  
  Creating lists of valid Organization, Service, Schedule, and Award Codes.
  Done.

  Validating Volunteer data.
  THIS WILL TAKE SONE TIME.
  Errors found in Volunteer data: 6
  
  The data checking on your system is complete!
  
  After the validation finishes, you can immediately print the results.
  Whether you print it at this time or not, the information on incorrect
  entries is stored and can be printed at any later time. 
  
  Do you want to print the results now? YES
  DEVICE: HOME//<RET>VIRTUAL CONNECTION    Right Margin: 80//<RET> 
  
  The error reports are grouped by type and indicate the record number (IEN)
  of the record that contains the problem.  For the volunteers, the name of
  the volunteer is also shown to help in identification.
  
  This completes the data validation option.  This option can be rerun with
  results reflecting the status of your data at the time it is rerun.
  
  You do not, however, need to rerun the option just to view the results of
  a prior run.  You can print previous results.
  
  
  PRINT RESULTS OF DATA VALIDATION:
  
    PREP   Prepare for Transition to VSS

    OCC    Occasional Hours Edit
    SEND   Send Voluntary Data to VSS
  
  Select Voluntary Data Migration Menu Option: Print Results of Data Validation
  
  You can print results of the Examination of Existing Data 
  by selecting the date/time that the examination was done.
  
  Note that the validation results are stored by date and time run.  The
  simplest way to  choose the results to print is to input the date that the
  validation was run.  In the following example, the results of validation run
  "TODAY" are requested.  You select the specific set of data validated to
  print.  In this example, the results for Regular and Occasional Hours are
  selected.

  CORRECTING DATA:
  
  You are requested to run the data validation option weeks before the actual
  switch to the new system so that you have the opportunity to correct invalid
  records.  Corrected records will be migrated to the new system while those
  remaining with an error will be rejected.
  
  The method of correction will depend on the problem.  In some cases, you
  will have to contact volunteers; in others, you will have to refer to paper
  records.  When the necessary information is obtained, you will usually be
  able to use the existing VTK options to make the change.  You can also use
  the three options supplied in this patch: Master Volunteer Edit , Daily Time
  Edit, Occasional Hours Edit. If you cannot use the normal options, contact
  your local IRM.  If your local IRM cannot resolve the issue they should file
  a NOIS report and NVS will assist in getting the problem resolved.
  
  Following is an example of correcting Volunteer data.  Copied below is a
  line from the validation report run above:
  
  Volunteer record #3418 with Name MAYO,MARION has incorrect sex data.
  
  A volunteer with record number 3418 in the Voluntary Master file whose name
  is Marion Mayo somehow has incorrect information in the SEX field.  It is
  unimportant how that erroneous data got there.  Suppose you determine that
  Marion is a woman.  Correct the error by using the Register/Edit Volunteer
  in Master File option:
  
  
  Select Master File Maintenance Menu Option: Register/Edit Volunteer in
  Master File
  
  Select Volunteer Name: `3418  MAYO,MARION
  
  Note: the volunteer is selected by putting an accent grave (`) in front of
  the entry number from the error report.  This method should work for any
  data you are correcting, regardless of file.  In this case, you could have
  also used the name.
  
  Do you wish to Add/Edit Volunteer specific data? YES//<RET>   (YES)
  
  NICKNAME: <RET>
  PSEUDO INDICATOR: <RET>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: 999-99-9999// <RET>
  STREET ADDRESS #1: 1 Main St.// <RET>
  STREET ADDRESS #2: <RET>
  CITY: MORENO VALLEY// <RET>
  STATE: CALIFORNIA// <RET>
  ZIP CODE: 92553// <RET>
  
  Here the source of the error is clear.  Somehow a "Z" was input into the
  SEX field.  The data validation option identified this as being incorrect.
  Here, it is corrected to F for Female.
  
  SEX: Z// F  Female, 21 and over
  BIRTH DATE: JUL 1970// ^
  Do you wish to continue to the next section? YES// NO  (NO)
  Do you need to transmit this record to Austin? YES// NO  (NO)
                            <  No Action Taken>
  
  Now, Marion's entry and the entries of the Regular Hours that she worked
  can be sent to the new system.
