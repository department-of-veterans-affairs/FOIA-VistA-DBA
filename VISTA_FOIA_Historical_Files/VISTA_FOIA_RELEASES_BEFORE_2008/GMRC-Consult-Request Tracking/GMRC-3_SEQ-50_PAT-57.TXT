Subject: SUICIDE HOTLINE CONSULT SETUP

Category: 
  - Enhancement ()
  - Routine
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The National Suicide Hotline Interfacility Consult (IFC) process will 
 start on 8/15/07 at the Canandaigua VAMC, using the VISN2 VistA 
 database.  Hotline call handlers will order IFCs to be sent to the 
 appropriate location where the caller can be cared for.  This patch will 
 install an entry in every VISTA database file #123.5 REQUEST SERVICES, 
 called SUICIDE HOTLINE.  The entry will be populated with the NAME (.01) 
 of SUICIDE HOTLINE, SERVICE USAGE (2) of TRACKING ONLY and the IFC SENDING
 FACILITY (134,.01) of UPSTATE NEW YORK HCS.  "Tracking Only" will 
 prevent this consult service from being ordered directly; it should 
 only be used as an IFC consult generated from the National Suicide 
 Hotline.  After the entry is automatically created, it will also be added
 to the "ALL SERVICES" entry as an item in the SUB-SERVICE (10) multiple.  
 Additionally, an entry corresponding to SUICIDE HOTLINE will be added to
 the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (101.43).
  
  
 It is extremely critical that the NAME of this service never be changed 
 or edited and for that reason we have modified the data dictionary for 
 file 123.5 and the input template used when creating or editing a consult 
 service, to prevent deletion and/or editing of this entry.  For the IFC
 process to work efficiently, the service needs to always be SUICIDE
 HOTLINE unless changed nationally by a subsequent patch.  After the entry
 is created via the patch installation process, the associated fields for
 consult service tracking and management can be populated with local users,
 teams, user classes, printers, etc. as with other consult services.  Also
 after the patch is installed, the SUICIDE HOTLINE service can be "moved"
 to another location within the site's consult hierarchy system.  For
 example, if sites need to move the SUICIDE HOTLINE service from ALL
 SERVICES to a grouper for Mental Health or Social Work Service, the
 service can be added as a SUB-SERVICE to the appropriate grouper and then
 removed from the SUB-SERVICE field under ALL SERVICES.  CAUTION: Please do
 not remove the SUICIDE HOTLINE from the consult hierarchy.
  
  
 If you need assistance making changes to this consult service, please 
 contact the VA Service Desk (1-888-596-4357) or log a Remedy Ticket to
 Consult Request Tracking.
