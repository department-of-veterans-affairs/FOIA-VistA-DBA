 ISW-0702-20339         EDI Prompt
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 Patch PRC*5.1*51 introduced the erroneous prompt, "Do You Want to Send

 Order [PRCH ENTER SIMPLIFIED ORDER], New Detailed Purchase Card Order
 [PRCH ENTER DETAILED ORDER], Edit Simplified Purchase Card Order [PRCH
 EDIT SIMPLIFIED ORDER], and Edit Detailed Purchase Card Order [PRCH EDIT
 DETAILED ORDER].

 The prompt has been removed from the options listed in the Problem 
 section.  Additionally, a text message has been added that will appear 
 when an EDI vendor is used with the options listed above.  The new text 
 message will appear like this:
  
                            ***** TAKE NOTE *****
  
                      This order will not be sent via EDI.
