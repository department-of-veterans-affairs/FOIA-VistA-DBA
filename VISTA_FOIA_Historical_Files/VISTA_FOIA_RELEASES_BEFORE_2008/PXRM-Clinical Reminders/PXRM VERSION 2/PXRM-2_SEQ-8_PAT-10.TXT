 Installation and Setup Guide  
 
 Clinical Reminders documentation can also be found in the VistA Documentation 
 Library:  http://www.va.gov/vdl.
 
 Installation:
 =============
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take less
 than 5 minutes. Installation should be coordinated with the person who manages
 Clinical Reminders at your site and be scheduled during a time of lower system
 usage.
 
 Using the Kernel KIDs menu
 
 1. Use the 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS installation menu.
    When prompted to enter a host file type in
    PXRM_GMTS_TIU_SKIN_RISK_ASSESSMENTS.KID
 
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
 
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (PXRM*2.0*10)
 
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?"
    YES//  respond 'NO'
 
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
    "respond 'NO'.
 
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
    and Protocols? YES//," respond 'No'. 
 
 7. When prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//," respond '0'.
    This installation should not be queued; it will be installing
    some packed reminder definitions and may require selection of
    replacements for some components. Therefore it is recommended
    that the site's Clinical Reminder Manager is present during the
    install.
 
 8. The init routines PXRMP10I, GMTSP87I, and TIUPR230 may be deleted once 
    the installation has completed. Sites should use the Kernel
    "Delete Routines" option [XTRDEL] to delete these routines.
 
 Post-Install instructions
 =========================
 The following dialog elements are meant to be used for ordering a consult to 
 the team at your facility that does further evaluation.
 
 VA-VANOD OI SKIN RISK ORDER NUTRITION CONSULT
 VA-VANOD OI WOUND CONSULT
 
 At the time of install, the Reminder Dialog will use the GMRCOR CONSULT as the
 consult orderable item for both of the dialog elements. Sites should 
 substitute a quick order or order menu for ordering consults to the Nutrition
 Team or a Wound Care Specialist at your facility. If no such service is 
 available yet, then sites may wish to leave the GMRCOR CONSULT in the dialog 
 element until a consult becomes available.
 
 The mapping of the site-specific Quick Order should be done by the site 
 Clinical Reminder Manager. To map a site-specific quick order to the above 
 dialog elements, do the following from the Reminder Managers menu. 
 
   1.  Select DM Reminder Dialog Management
   2.  Select DI Reminder Dialogs
   3.  Type CV, then press Enter
   4.  Type E, then press Enter
   5.  Type SL, then press Enter
   6.  Type the name of the dialog element, 
       VA-VANOD OI SKIN RISK ORDER NUTRITION CONSULT and press Enter
   7.  At the "Find Next" prompt type No, then press Enter
   8.  Type the item number next to the element, then press Enter
   9.  At the finding Item Prompt, enter Q. plus the name of the site-specific 
       Quick Order or order menu, then press Enter
   10. Press Enter at the Additional Finding prompt
   11. Press Enter at the Edit prompt
