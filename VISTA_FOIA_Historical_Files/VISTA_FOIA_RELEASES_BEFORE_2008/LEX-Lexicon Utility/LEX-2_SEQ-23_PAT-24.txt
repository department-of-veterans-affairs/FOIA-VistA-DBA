 FTP Software Retrieval:
 =======================
   Global Host File:                  LEX_2_24.GBL  (ASCII)
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  
     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
  which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
  location at the following locations.
   
     Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
            
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*24. It is
       recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak hours.
       This patch should take less than 10 minutes to install.
   
       Routine mapping is not recommended for the routines released in this
       patch.
  
       >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
       If you have installed LEX*2.0*24 into another account, and the 
       Lexicon global ^LEX is translated into the current account,
       you may go directly to step 5 of the installation instructions.
  
       It is not necessary to install the data more than once per 
       translation.
                                                                       
       >>>>>>>  IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<
   
   2)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
       not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you 
       will need to kill this global before proceeding.
    
       To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
    
         DSM    
    
           K ^LEXM
    
         Cache
    
           The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system wide 
           setting, but can be allowed for a particular process using the
           $ZU command.  The command for enabling unsubscripted global 
           kills is:
    
             VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
             VAH>K ^LEXM
    
           The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process is 
           S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and 
           creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
    
   3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_24.GBL.  This 
       file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
   
         DSM
    
           Use ^%GTI and the input device LEX_2_24.GBL
    
         Cache/NT and Cache/VMS
           
           Cache v2.1.6 - Global Restore
    
           We recommend that the GUI Thin Client be used to restore the
           global.  Be sure to select the VAH namespace in the "Global 
           Utilities" window.  Make sure that you select the global host
           file LEX_2_24.GBL (File / Open) before changing the file 
           format.  With the namespace and file selected, change the 
           restore file format to VAX DSM.
  
           Cache v3.2 - Global Restore
  
           Using the Cache 3.2 Thin Client, right click on the Cache cube,
           then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces" folder, then open
           the "VAH" folder, and right click on the "Globals" folder. Select
           the "Import from disk" option. Click on the "Options..." button.
           Select the "Globals" tab, make sure the format is VAX DSM, then
           click "OK." Find the file in the directory, double click on
           LEX_2_24.GBL. Next, select "Import All" at the prompt
           "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select "Yes."
    
           Using the GUI utilities will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> error when
           restoring a global saved under DSM  (usually seen when using 
           the CHUI %GI utility to restore a DSM global).
    
       The loading of the global should take from 1 to 2 minutes.
   
   4)  Turn journaling off for globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM.
    
         DSM
     
           Use ^%GLOMAN
           For the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
           Select "Change Journaling Capabilities"
           Select "D" for "Disabled"
    
        Cache/NT
  
          Cache v2.1.6 - Journaling
  
          We recommend using the GUI System Operations Utilities.  Select the
          database where the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM reside using the
          Databases tab (to find out where a global resides use the GUI global
          utility directory tab).  Then select the menu item Action / Database
          / Global attributes.  In the Attributes and Journaling window, click
          on the "Globals" button.  Select the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
          (note the "All Globals" check box needs to be unmarked to select a
          specific global).
          Make sure the check box under the column heading "Journal" is
          unmarked for the ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM globals and then click "OK."
  
          Cache v3.2 - Journaling
  
          Using the Cache v3.2 Thin Client, right click on the Cache cube,
          then, select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local Databases" folder,
          then open the folder where the ^LEX* globals reside. Right click
         ^LEX, select "Properties," and uncheck the "Journal global" box.
          Repeat for ^LEXT and ^LEXM globals.
  
        Cache/VMS
               
          It is not possible to disable journaling for individual files on
          Cache/VMS systems. Caution should be exercised with regard to the
          amount of journal space that may be required.
    
   5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
   
   6)  Distribution Load:
   
       Load the Distribution from the Packman Message using the Packman 
       function "Install/Check Message."
   
         Environment Check:  
    
           Only package components and system variables will be checked 
           during the loading of the transport global.
   
   7)  KIDS Installation:
   
       Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action "Install
       Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*24.  The KIDS installation
       should take less than a minute (with journaling off) depending
       on the number of users/jobs on the system.
   
         Environment Check:  
    
           LEX*2.0*24 data exists (by global translation):
  
             If the data for LEX*2.0*24 has been installed and is translated
             into the current account, then only package components and 
             system variables will be checked.
  
           LEX*2.0*24 data does not exist:
  
             If the data for LEX*2.0*24 can not be found (either in the 
             current account or by translation) then the environment check
             routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build namespace
             and global checksum.  This is to insure that the correct 
             import global is loaded and that all of the data contained in
             the import global arrived at your site during the FTP 
             transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the wrong import
             global or the global fails the checksum, the install will 
             stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP another copy of
             the import global (see the section on FTP Software Retrieval
             and step 3 of the Installation Instructions).
             
         
         Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
         install? YES//" prompt.
         Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu 
         Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
   
   8)  Cleanup
   
       a)  Check that the export global ^LEXM has been killed automatically. 
    
           If it has not been automatically killed you will need to kill 
           the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent import global
           checksum errors on future installations.  (see step 2 for 
           "unsubscripted" kills)
    
       b)  If journaling was turned off in step 4 for the ^LEX and ^LEXT 
           globals, turn journaling back on.
    
           DSM
    
             Same instructions as in step 4 except select "E" for "Enabled"
    
           Cache/NT and Cache/VMS
  
             Same instructions as in step 4 except make sure the check 
             box under the column heading "Journal" is marked for the 
             ^LEX and ^LEXT globals.
  
       c)  Check that the routines LEX2024 and LEX2024P have been deleted
           automatically. If they have not been automatically deleted, delete
           routines LEX2024 and LEX2024P. These are the environment check and
           post-install routines.
