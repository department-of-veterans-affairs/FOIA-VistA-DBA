       EE Abstract Edit Primary
         3. Stage of Disease at Diagnosis
   
     The third edition SEER Extent of Disease -- 1988 codes have been added.
     These codes are used by the EXTENSION (#165.5,30) and LYMPH NODES 
     (#165.5,31) fields for 1998 or later primaries.
   
     The prostate gland now has both clinical and pathologic extensions.  
     For this reason a new field, PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION (#165.5,30.1) has been 
     added for PROSTATE (C61.9) primaries. 
   
  2) NEW TREATMENT FIELDS: a) "AT THIS FACILITY" FIELDS

     These fields will be used for all 1998 or later cases.
   
  3) PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report
     NOIS ASH-0898-31002 ABSTRACT STATUS NOT COMPLETE REPORT CONTAINS 
                         COMPLETED ABS
   
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       NC Print Abstract NOT Complete List
   
     The PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report was erroneously including
     primaries with an ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91) of "Complete".
   
     The ONCO ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Sort Template has been modified to
     eliminate primaries with an ABSTRACT STATUS of "Complete".

         3. Stage of Disease at Diagnosis
   
     If the user entered a response to the above prompts that failed the
     input transform (e.g. .1), the package would abort with an "undefined
     variable X" error.  
      
     The input transforms for these fields has been modified to resolve
     this problem.
   
  5) ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT
     FORUM message: Patch 15, Alpha Testing [#25901204] item 7c.
   
     UTL *..Utility Options ...
       RS Registry Summary Reports
         A Annual
   
     a) The ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT was listing SKIN twice: as "SKIN (EX
        reproductive)" and as "SKIN".  The "SKIN (EX reproductive)" entry
        contained the correct skin statistics while the "SKIN" totals were
        all zeros. 
   
        The "SKIN" entry has been removed from the report.
   
     b) CLINICAL STAGE GROUP (#165.5,38) and PATHOLOGIC STAGE GROUP 
        (#165.5,88) NA (Not applicable - code 88) stuffing
   
        The NA stuffing logic for these fields did not include stuffing of 
        the STAGE GROUPING-AJCC (#165.5,38.5) field.  This omission was 
        causing inaccuracies in the Annual Summary Report by counting primaries
        with a stage group of NA (Not applicable) as INC (Incomplete).  
   
        The stuffing logic now includes the STAGE GROUPING-AJCC field.
        Existing primaries affected by this error will be corrected by the
        pre-install routine.
   
  6) AJCC STAGING BASIS (#165.5,36)
     NOIS BIG-0697-71576 (notes 9,14,15)
   
     Oncology Site Manager Menu
       ER Report of accessions requiring additional input
   
     This option was incorrectly checking the AJCC STAGING BASIS field.  If
     the AJCC STAGING BASIS was blank, the routine logic was assuming that
     the TNM codes were also blank and listing them as missing required 
     data.
   
     Since both clinical and pathologic staging now have their own fields,
     the AJCC STAGING BASIS field is no longer necessary.  The AJCC STAGING
     BASIS check has been removed.
   
  7) INCORRECT POINTERS IN STATE (#3) FIELD OF ZIP CODE (#5.11) FILE
     NOIS ALB-0698-51661  Error in Zip Code file with a State code
     NOIS BHH-0698-42176  Zip Code file has many states with #80
   
     Several pointer values in the STATE field of the ZIP CODE file were
     either missing or incorrect.  These pointer values have been re-set
     with the correct values.
   
  8) CANCER-DIRECTED SURGERY
   
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       EE Abstract Edit Primary
         4. First Course of Treatment
   
     If the SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE (#165.5,58.2) value was 00 (None) or 99
     (Unknown; death certificate ONLY), the following fields would be
     automatically stuffed:
   
     #138 SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY
     #140 NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED
     #23  RECONSTRUCTION/RESTORATION
    
     This stuffing relationship has been removed.  These field are now
     independent of the SURGERY OF PRIMARY SITE value.
   
  9) CLASS OF CASE (#165.5,.04) in relation to the following ONCOLOGY 
     PRIMARY (#165.5) fields:
   
     REPORTING HOSPITAL            (#.03)
     DX FACILITY                   (#5)
     REFERRING FACILITY            (#6)
     TRANSFER FACILITY             (#7)
     SURGERY HOSPITAL              (#50.1)
     RADIATION HOSPITAL            (#51.1)
     RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS HOSP (#52.1)
     CHEMOTHERAPY HOSPITAL         (#53.1)
     HORMONE THERAPY HOSPITAL      (#54.1)
     IMMUNOTHERAPY HOSPITAL        (#55.1)
     OTHER TREATMENT HOSPITAL      (#57.1)
   
     If CLASS OF CASE = 0 Dx here, 1st rx ew
                      = 1 Dx here & 1st rx here
                      = 4 Dx or 1st rx before ref date
                      = 5 Dx at autopsy
       DX FACILITY will be stuffed with the REPORTING HOSPITAL value
   
     If CLASS OF CASE = 2 Dx ew, 1st rx here
                      = 3 Dx ew, 1st rx ew
       DX FACILITY will be stuffed with the REFERRING HOSPITAL value
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 0 Dx here, 1st rx ew
       REFERRING FACILITY will be stuffed with NONE
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 1 Dx here & 1st rx here
       REFERRING FACILITY and TRANSFER FACILITY will be stuffed with NONE
    
     If CLASS OF CASE = 2 Dx ew, 1st rx here
       TRANSFER FACILITY will be stuffed with NONE
   
     If CLASS OF CASE = 1 Dx here & 1st rx here
                      = 2 Dx ew, 1st rx here
       SURGERY HOSPITAL
       RADIATION HOSPITAL
       RADIATION THERAPY TO CNS HOSP
       CHEMOTHERAPY HOSPITAL
       HORMONE THERAPY HOSPITAL
       IMMUNOTHERAPY HOSPITAL
       OTHER TREATMENT HOSPITAL
         will be stuffed with the REPORTING HOSPITAL value if the treatment
         was administered. 
   
 10) AGE AT DX (#165.5,4)
   
     When the patient's DATE DX (#165.5,3) fell on their birthday, the 
     AGE AT DX algorithm was computing the AGE AT DX incorrectly.  This
     has been fixed.
   
 11) 1998 PROSTATE PCE STUDY
     QUESTION #12: INITIAL METHOD OF DIAGNOSIS
     
     As per the "News from the Commission on Cancer" Volume 9 No 5 Page 5
     ("Patient Care Evaluation Studies: Clarifications"), the code values of
     the following ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) fields have been changed:
  
              Old value        New value
              ---------        ---------
     Code 0:  Not done         No
     Code 1:  Done             Yes
     Code 9:  Unknown if done  Unknown  
  
     Fields affected
     ---------------
     #661 CLINICAL DX WITH BONE LESION
     #662 CLINICAL DX BY RECTAL EXAM
     #663 CYTOLOGY
     #664 DIGITAL TRANSRECTAL BIOPSY
     #665 INCIDENTAL FINDING IN TURP FOR BENIGN DISEASE
     #666 NEEDLE BIOPSY, NOS
     #667 PERINEAL BIOPSY
     #668 PSA
     #669 TRUS GUIDED BIOPSY
     #670 TURP, NOS
     
 12) INFRA/SUPRA (#165.5,21.5)
   
     Since there is no formal classification or staging system for 5th
     edition brain cases, the INFRA/SUPRA prompt has been removed for
     these cases.
  
 13) NUMBER OF TREATMENTS (#165.5,56)
 
     ABS *..Abstracting/Printing ...
       PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)
 
     When printing the complete abstract, the "Number of Treatments" value
     in the Radiation portion of the FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT section was
     not displaying.  This has been fixed.
