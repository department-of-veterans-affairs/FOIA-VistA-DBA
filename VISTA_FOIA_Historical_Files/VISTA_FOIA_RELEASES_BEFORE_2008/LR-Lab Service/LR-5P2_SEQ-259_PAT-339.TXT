Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*339 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*339 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*339 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
 (Results of risk analyses will be listed here.)
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
 ==========================================================================
  
 This patch updates the RE / Results entry found in the LRMI /  
 Microbiology menu. The patch corrects an error in the results delete
 process. This process is entered when jumping out using the "^", while 
 entering the antibiotic.
  
 Also, the patch corrects a problem sites have encountered installing 
 patch LR*5.2*257 because a routine is missing an asterisk (*) in the 
 second line of the routine.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
  
 Problem 1:
 ==========
 HD71280 / FGH-0205-31076:  ERROR UNDEFINDED>DELINT+5LRMIBUG
  
 The sites report getting a <UNDEFINDED>DELINT+5^LRMIBUG error when using 
 the "^" to exit.
  
 Solution 1:
 ===========
 The software that removes the interpretive results was using the variable 
 DIC to address the correct result. The fault was due to the variable DIC 
 not existing. The process calls routine DIE when jumping out with "^". 
 This path kills the variable DIC. The solution was to set and use 
 routine variables to save the data needed to address the correct result, 
 when deleting.
  
  
 Problem 2:
 ==========
 HD102862:  Install of LR*5.2*257, missing patches
  
 The sites report a problem installing LR*5.2*257. The fault was the 
 second line of the routine LRMITSRH was missing an asterisk * following
 the patch list. i.e.: ;;5.2;LAB SERVICE;**257*;Sep 27, 1994   The parsing
 routine when running the Transport global compare for the 2nd line option 
 didn't like that missing *.
  
 Solution 2:
 ===========
 Add the missing asterisk to the second line of the routine. Since this is 
 a comment line, the change does not affect the LAB functionality nor does 
 it change the routine checksum. 
  
  
 ROUTINE SUMMARY:
 ===============
  
    The following routines are included in this patch.  The second line
    of each of these routines now looks like:

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*339'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//'
