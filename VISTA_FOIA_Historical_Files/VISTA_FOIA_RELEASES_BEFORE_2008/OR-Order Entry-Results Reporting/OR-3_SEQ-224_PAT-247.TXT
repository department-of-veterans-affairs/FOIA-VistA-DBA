 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
  
 PROBLEM:
 ========
 Patients were disappearing from Team List when moved via ADT MANAGER MENU
 DG MANAGER MENU / ADT Manager Menu / Bed Control Menu.
 This was a very intermittent problem and may seem to occur with any of 
 the patient Bed Control menu process.  This problem appears most on the 
 Treating Specialty Transfer. 
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 The process removes the patient being move from all Auto Linked Team List 
 then adds the patients back to the appropriate list. The routine that 
 does this, ORLPAUT0, uses a Fileman call to file the patient name on the 
 correct list. But it failed to initialize the optional variable DINUM 
 when making this call. If this variable happens to have a value left by 
 another process which failed to clear it, then Fileman uses this value to 
 file the patient and the results are unpredictable.
