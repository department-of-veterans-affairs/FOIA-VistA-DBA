Subject: PATIENT CONTEXT IN TEST VS. PRODUCTION

Category:

  - Other

Description:
============

 DESCRIPTION:
 ============
 This patch addresses patient safety issue PSI-04-018, which, results from
 an inability to definitively identify types (production or test) of VISTA 
 systems. Because of this inability, it is sometimes possible to 
 synchronize patients Care management and CPRS between systems.
 Specifically, if a user has Care Management open and running against a
 test system and also has another GUI VISTA application open and running
 against a production system, when the user changes patient context in Care
 Management the user's action causes the application connected to the
 production system to change patient context accordingly. This could
 possibly lead to a situation where each application is working on the same
 patient but in different systems. Patch ORRC*1*1 enables Care Management
 to implement XU*8*284 functionality which will distinguish between test
 and production accounts. This assures that patient-context changes among
 VISTA applications can occur only within the same system.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  The VHA strongly recommends that you install the patch in a test 
  environment before installing it in production.
  
  Although this patch may be installed prior to OR*3*195 (CPRS GUI v25)
  it is recommended to install this patch as close to the installation of 
  OR*3*195 as possible. The installation of this patch without installing 
  OR*3*195 could prevent the 'Go to Chart' synchronization functionality
  between Care Management and CPRS in test systems only.
  
  
  This patch contains two components: an M build and a new Java plug-in. 
  You must install these components in a specific order for the changes to 
  take effect and to avoid client/server mismatches.
  
  This patch should be installed at non-peak hours. Installation should 
  take less than 5 minutes. Users may remain on the system during
  installation.
  
  First: Install the M build:  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ORRC*1.0*1):
           a.  Backup a Transport Global
           b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ORRC*1.0*1
   6.  When prompted " Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//",respond NO.
   7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//' respond NO.
   8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
   9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
   
  Second: Install the Java Plug-In:
   1. Unzip the file ORRC_1_1.ZIP into the HEVD directory on the 
      HealtheVet server.
   2. This will install the new plug-in in the Plugins directory and will 
      place a file named config_orrc_1_1.xml in the HEVD root directory.
   3. To make the new plug-in active, you will need to rename the current 
      config.xml file to config_old.xml. Then rename the 
      config_orrc_1_1.xml file to config.xml.
  
      NOTE: If you are installing the plug-in into a test environment, the 
            above-mentioned file names should be preceded by the word test 
            (e.g. testconfig.xml)
  
   4. There is no need to modify the config.settings files for proper 
      installation of this patch.
   5. At such time you are confident in the functionality contained in 
      this patch, the config_old.xml file may be deleted from the HEVD
      directory.
