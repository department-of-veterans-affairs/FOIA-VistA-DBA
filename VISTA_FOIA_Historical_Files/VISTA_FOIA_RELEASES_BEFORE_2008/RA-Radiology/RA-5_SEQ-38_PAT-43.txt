Subject: Miscellaneous: Correcting non-standard code, cleans up the UTILITY global.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This is a general-purpose patch that addresses a number of NOIS calls.
 A brief description of the NOIS calls addressed is provided below. 
  
 COS-0702-43112
 --------------
 The routine RART includes 'W *7' in its code which is non-standard M 
 code. After this patch, references to 'W *7' will be replaced with 
 standard M code, in this case, 'W $C(7)'. Note that we are addressing
 this specific NOIS for this particular routine. It is our intent to
 remove non-standard code as it is encountered in future patch releases.
  
 TUC-0403-60871
 --------------
 Routine RARTR fails to kill '^UTILITY($J,"W")' after calls to the '^DIWP'
 FileMan function.  This FileMan utility is used to present the 'Clinical  
 History', 'Impression Text', and 'Report Text' in a user-friendly format.
 Jumping to other VistA software applications that use this same FileMan
 utility to display data, may, on occasion, display Rad/Nuc Med data. 
 Tucson discovered this problem by jumping from ListManager CPRS, where the
 user displayed the chart contents of an imaging record for a patient,
 to the 'Approval Requests' [PRCSAPP] option. Left over Rad/Nuc Med data 
 displayed erroneously as the description of the order.
  
 NCH-0803-41382
 --------------
 Previously, the option 'Diagnostic Code Enter/Edit' [RA DIAGEDIT] allowed
 editing of the local Diagnostic Code name. This essentially corrupts the
 data for records 'pointing to' this file. RAMAIN has been changed to 
 disallow the editing of the Diagnostic Code name.
  
 MIW-0803-40862                                                            
 --------------
 The SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME (#20.2) field of the NEW PERSON (#200)
 file allows a maximum of forty characters. The ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CODE 
 (#10) field on the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS (#74) file stores the encrypted
 form of the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME but allows a maximum of thirty
 characters. If the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME is greater than thirty
 characters in length the software will attempt to file this string into
 the ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CODE field when the report is verified.
  
 This verification event will cause a '??' to appear immediately after the
 'REPORT STATUS' prompt. This error does not prevent the report from moving
 to a status of 'Verified'. To correct this issue, the ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE
 CODE (#10) field on the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS (#74) has been modified to
 accept a maximum of fifty characters.
  
 The options impacted directly are: 'On-line Verifying of Reports' [RA
 RPTONLINEVERIFY], 'Report Entry/Edit' [RA RPTENTRY] & 'Verify Report Only'
 [RA RPTVERIFY].
  
 The 'RA REPORT EDIT' & 'RA VERIFY REPORT ONLY' input templates are
 compiled. They are exported in this patch so that the modified data
 dictionary (ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE CODE) takes effect when the options 
 above are exercised.
  
 Within the input templates, the non-standard M 'W *7' string has been
 replaced with the standard M 'W $C(7)' string.
  
 Note: Different systems might compile routines to different sizes due to
 the ^DD("ROU") node definitions. For this reason, checksum values for
 compiled input template routines are not provided.
  
 Documentation
 =============
 The Radiology/Nuclear Medicine version 5.0 ADPAC Guide will be updated, at
 a date after the release of this patch, to reflect the software changes
 impact on the 'Diagnostic Code Enter/Edit' [RA DIAGEDIT] option. (NOIS:
 NCH-0803-41382)

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than two minutes.  Since there
 are data dictionary changes, this patch should be installed when all 
 Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS distribution onto your system.
   
  3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
     the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is 
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
        When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*43
   
        When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//", respond NO.
   
        When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
        YES//", respond YES.      
  
        When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark
        as 'Out of Order':", enter the following: 
      
            Display a Rad/Nuc Med Report         RA RPTDISP
            Draft Report (Reprint)               RA REPRINT
            On-line Verifying of Reports         RA RPTONLINEVERIFY
            Report Entry/Edit                    RA RPTENTRY
            Select Report to Print by Patient    RA RPTPAT
            Verify Report Only                   RA RPTVERIFY
            Diagnostic Code Enter/Edit           RA DIAGEDIT
            CPRS Clinician Menu                  OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN
  
        When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of
        Order':", just press the Enter key to skip this prompt. 
  
     5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
        KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print' [XPD
        PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*43).
  
     6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
