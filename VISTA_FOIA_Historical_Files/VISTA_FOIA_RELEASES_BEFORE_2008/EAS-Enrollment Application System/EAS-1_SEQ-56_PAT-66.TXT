Subject: 10-10 EZ/EZR PHASE 3.0 FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PLEASE NOTE: A 15 day install is requested as this patch affects Means
 Test printing capabilities.
  
  After installing the 1010 EZ PHASE 3 ENHANCEMENTS patches (DG*5.3*624 and
  EAS*1.0*57), the following problems were reported:
  
     1)  If there are no entries for a patient's means test money amounts,
         the 10-10 would print zeros (instead of nulls) for "LIST OTHER 
         INCOME AMOUNTS" (in the GROSS ANNUAL INCOME section) and "CASH,
         AMOUNT IN BANK ACCOUNTS" and "VALUE OF OTHER PROPERTY" (in the NET
         WORTH section).
  
     2)  A future means test contains the Adjusted Medical Expense, but no
         Gross Medical Expense, until the means test is viewed or edited.
         If that future means test is selected to print, the 10-10 will
         print a zero for the Gross Medical Expense displayed in "TOTAL
         NON-REIMBURSED MEDICAL EXPENSES PAID BY YOU OR YOUR SPOUSE"
         (in the PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES section).
  
     3.  The printing of SPINAL CORD INJURY is incorrect.  If the answer
         stored in VistA is "NOT APPLICABLE," it correctly prints as "NO,"
         but all other answers (and no answer) print as blank.
  
  ASSOCIATED E3R(s):
  =================
  N/A
  
  ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(S):
  ===========================
  HD0000000109428 - For a completed means test, on the 10-10EZR, the
     deductible expenses show up.  However, if you print a 10-10EZ on the
     same patient with the same test date, no deductible expenses show up.
  
     Resolution:  (Issue # 2)
     ----------
     Force the recalculation of the Gross Medical Expenses for all means
     tests to be printed.
  
  To resolve the first issue, this patch will check for null answers stored
  in VistA, and the 10-10 will print a null answer when appropriate.
  
  To resolve the third issue, this patch will no longer file SPINAL CORD
  INJURY from the EAS module into VistA.  Also, the 10-10 printing
  functionality has been changed to print a more appropriate answer:
     - If the entry stored in VistA is "NOT APPLICABLE," the 10-10 will
       print "NO."
     - If the entry is one of the other values in the set of codes for this
       field ("PARAPLEGIA-TRAUMATIC", "QUADRIPLEGIA-NONTRAUMATIC", etc.),
       the 10-10 will print "YES."
     - If the entry  stored in VistA is null, the 10-10 will print "UNK" for
       "UNKNOWN."
  
  
  Data Element Change:
  ===================
  The following data element in file 711 (1010EZ Mapping) will no longer be
  filed from the EAS module into VistA:
