Subject: INTERACTIONS NOT SENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 The option Enter/Edit Local Drug Interaction [PSS INTERACTION LOCAL ADD]
 allows sites to make local entries in the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56).
 When this option is invoked a message is sent to the mail group
 G.NDF SUPPORT@ISCPNDF.FO-BIRM.MED.VA.GOV.  During the period 26 October 2006
 through 27 February 2007, a problem with the network configuration caused
 these messages not to be transmitted.  This problem has been corrected.
 This patch transmits a list of all interactions that were entered locally
 during that time period.  That list is also sent to members of the
 NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the
 installer of the patch.
 NOTE: The message is not sent across the network from a test account.  It
 is sent only to local recipients.
 NOTE: Since the sender of the mail message is the installer of the patch,
 the message will not show as new to the installer.
