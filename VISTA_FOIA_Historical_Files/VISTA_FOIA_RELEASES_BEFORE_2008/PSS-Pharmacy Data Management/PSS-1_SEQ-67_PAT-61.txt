Description: 
============

 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in 
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA 
 pilot project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
 Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order 
 entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital 
 signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
 packages were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
  
 This is the PDM patch that provides the following new functionalities:
  
 1. It provides CPRS with new API's 3737 and 3739 (these are modifications
 of existing API's 3373 and 3233 which shall remain unchanged). The logic
 of deriving at the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code for drugs associated with an 
 orderable item has changed. The National Drug File data update patches
 PSN*4*64 and PSN*4*66 assign a CS Federal Schedule to controlled
 substances and identify controlled substances as narcotics or
 non-narcotics by populating the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA
 PRODUCT file (#50.68). If any of the active dispense drugs associated with
 the Pharmacy orderable item for the specified package are matched to an
 entry in NDF, then the most restrictive CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code will be
 returned. If there is no match or the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code is 
 undefined, then the most restrictive DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code mapped to the
 corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code will be returned using the
 following table:
  
                          CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE     DEA, SPECIAL HDLG 
 Code
 Schedule I narcotics            1                        1
 Schedule II narcotics           2                       2A
 Schedule II non-narcotics      2n                       2C
 Schedule III narcotics          3                       3A
 Schedule III non-narcotics     3n                       3C
 Schedule IV narcotics           4                        4
 Schedule V narcotics            5                        5
  
 2. It includes a Post-Install routine to identify those drugs that show
 discrepancies between the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA 
 PRODUCT file (#50.68) and DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file 
 (#50), and generates the following 4 mail messages to the installer and
 the holders of the PSNMGR keys:
 CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE AND DEA, SPECIAL HDLG DISCREPANCIES
 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES NOT MATCHED
 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES NOT SET CORRECTLY
 DISCREPANCY IN DEA WITHIN DRUGS TIED TO AN OI
  
 These mail messages can be used to clean up the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code in
 the DRUG file (#50) where appropriate.
  
 The post-install also checks to see if the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) 
 of the DRUG file  (#50) is null and if the drug is matched to an entry in 
 the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68), and the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of 
 the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) has data, then it updates the DEA, SPECIAL 
 HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file  (#50) with the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code 
 mapped to corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code as defined in the above 
 table.
  
 3. It also provides the following new menu options to generate reports of
 the above mail messages:
 Controlled Substances/PKI Reports [PSS CS/PKI REPORTS] menu has the 
 following 4 new options:
   1 DEA Spec Hdlg & CS Fed Sch Discrepancy [PSS DEA VS CS FED. SCH.
     DISCR.]
   2 Controlled Substances Not Matched to NDF [PSS CS NOT MATCHED TO NDF]
   3 CS (DRUGS) Inconsistent with DEA Spec Hdlg [PSS CS DRUGS INCON WITH
     DEA]
   4 CS (Ord. Item) Inconsistent with DEA Spec Hdlg [PSS CS (OI) INCON WITH
     DEA]
 This new menu Controlled Substances/PKI Reports [PSS CS/PKI REPORTS],
 will be added to the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu.
  
 4. When using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, if the CS
 FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) and the DEA,
 SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) have a discrepancy, then
 this patch displays a warning message, "The CS Federal Schedule associated
 with this drug in the VA Product file represents a DEA, Special Handling
 code of XX", where XX is the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code mapped to 
 corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code as defined in the above table.
  
 5. This patch ensures that the newly populated CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field
 (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) is also included as part of the
 drug details in the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option.
  
 6. This patch introduces a new code "F" for NON REFILLABLE for the DEA,
 SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50). This will allow sites to 
 mark drugs other than controlled substances or clozapine drugs as NON
 REFILLABLE. This functionality will be effective in the Outpatient 
 Pharmacy V. 7.0 package only if the patch PSO*7.0*131 is installed.
  
 7. The designation "A" which stands for "NARCOTICS AND ALCOHOLICS" used in
 the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50), is changed in
 this patch to read as "NARCOTICS AND ALCOHOLS".

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Do not install this patch when Outpatient orders are being entered and
 signed through CPRS. Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours for CPRS.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
    be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*61):
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*61.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
      Install? YES//" respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
 9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
    returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
