Description: 
============

  MPIF*1*3 and XT*7.3*49 are required builds for patch RG*1.0*6.
   
  This patch includes special processing routines that allow the
  Duplicate Record Merge (XT*7.3*23) tool to run at a site with Clinical
  Information Resource Network - Patient Demographics and Master Patient
  Index (CIRN PD/MPI) version 1.0 installed.
   
  RG*1.0*6 and XT*7.3*49 (the Duplicate Record Merge patch) must both
  be installed in order to take advantage of this new functionality.
  For existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites, patch RG*1.0*6 should be installed
  immediately after XT*7.3*49.  For all other sites, RG*1.0*6 will be
  installed as part of your CIRN PD/MPI installation weekend.
   
  All fields on the MPI node of the PATIENT (#2) file, the TREATING
  FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file and the SUBSCRIPTION CONTROL (#774)
  file are addressed.
   
  When a pair of records is verified to be duplicates, the direction
  of the merge is selected, creating a "FROM" record and a "TO" record.
  The special processing routines assure that the correct data is in
  the "TO" record and removes the data in the "FROM" record, preventing
  fields from being overwritten.  The treating facilities and
  subscriptions are merged so that all treating facilities and
  subscribers are associated with the "TO" record and files pointing
  to the "FROM" record are removed.
   
  This patch addresses the following NOIS messages.  MIA-0300-31959, 
  MUR-0500-32673, SPO-0500-51392 and AMA-0700-71684.  All deal with
  the issue of duplicate record merge.
   
  To avoid a record being removed from the merge due to exceptions,
  follow the steps listed below while reviewing a potential duplicate
  record pair for verification.
   
  1.  Check for National Integration Control Number (ICN)
    - If both records in the potential duplicate pair have a national ICN
      assigned to them, this must be resolved before a merge can be done
      on the pair.
    - To identify whether or not the ICN is a national number, look at
      the first three digits.  If the first three digits are equal to
      your site station number, it is a local ICN, otherwise, it is a
      national ICN.
    - To resolve a pair with two national ICNs assigned, first determine
      which record will be the "FROM" record for the merge.  Inactivate
      that record from the MPI using the Inactivate Patient from MPI
      [MPIF PAT INACT] option on the Master Patient Index Menu [MPIF
      VISTA MENU].
    - If the record is shared with other sites, it cannot be inactivated.
      Enter a National Online Information Sharing (NOIS) call for the
      Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD) team to resolve.
      When entering a NOIS, include the ICNs and indicate which record
      is the "FROM" record in the information given.
    - If a pair goes through the merge with both records having national
      ICNs, a "Cannot Merge Duplicate Pair" exception message will be
      sent to the RG CIRN DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES mail group.  The exception
      must then be resolved using the steps outlined above.
   
  2.  Check the CIRN Master of Record (CMOR)
    - If either record of the potential duplicate record pair has a
      CMOR assigned that is NOT your local site, this must be resolved
      before a merge can be done on the pair.
    - To resolve a non-local CMOR, use the New CMOR Change Request [MPIF
      NEW REQUEST] option on the CIRN Master of Record (CMOR) Request
      [MPIF CMOR MGR] menu to request to be the CMOR for that patient.
    - When the CMOR change is accepted and updated to your local site
      you can approve the pair for merging.
    - If a pair goes through the merge with a CMOR assigned that is other
      than your site, a "Cannot Merge Duplicate Pair" exception message
      will be sent to the RG CIRN DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES mail group.  The
      exception must then be resolved using the steps outlined above.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish
  to install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less
  than 1 minute.
   
  For existing CIRN PD/MPI 1.0 sites, patch RG*1.0*6 should be installed
  immediately after XT*7.3*49.  For all other sites, RG*1.0*6 will be
  installed as part of your CIRN PD/MPI installation weekend.
     
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman menu.  [Note: 
      TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the 
      patch text only.]
   
  2.  None of the routines in the CIRN Patient Demographics package
      have been recommended for routine mapping.
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select

           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
