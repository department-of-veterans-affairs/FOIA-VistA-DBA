Subject: FHIE CONSULT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch is being done in coordination with and in conjunction
  with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Federal Health
  Information Exchange (FHIE) Enhancement Project, which shall 
  include current and historical data feeds on selected DOD data
  types for active duty and retired military members.
  
  A new report is being added with this patch that will become
  available on the DOD menu within the CPRS Reports Tab,
  and allow remote data to be pulled from the FHIE database.
    It is:
      
      Consults (DOD Remote data only)
  
  The Consults report will only display DOD Data from the remote
  FHIE database at this time.  No local or remote VA Consult
  reports will be shown when clicking on the Consult report from
  the Reports tab.  It is anticipated that such a report will be
  available at a later date, which will be distributed as a
  separate patch.
  
  This patch adds and modifies entries to the OE/RR Reports file
  (#101.24) for several DOD reports.
  
  WARNING: Items in the OE/RR REPORTS file (#101.24) with entry
  numbers greater than 999 are reserved, and should not be used
  for local enhancements.  If you have any local changes to items
  in this number range, that you want to keep, move them to an
  internal number <1000.  This patch will delete these entries 
  numbers before proceeding with the install.
