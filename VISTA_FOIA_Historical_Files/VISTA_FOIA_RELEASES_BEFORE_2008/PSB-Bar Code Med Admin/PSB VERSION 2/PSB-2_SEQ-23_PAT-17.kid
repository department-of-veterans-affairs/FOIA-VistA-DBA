appended with a unique type identifier.  The expected formats include:
"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,3,0)

  nP : a 'P' indicates that the order is PENDING action by Pharmacy
"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,5,0)
       Service.  (Given that the BCMA Backup System is designed to be
"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,6,0)
       real-time, pending orders are transmitted and stored on the
"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,7,0)

"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,13,0)

Order numbers are filed in this file with their respective alpha
"^DD",53.7,53.702,.01,21,15,0)
