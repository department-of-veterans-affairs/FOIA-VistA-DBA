Description:
============

 When using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 option, the labels are printing confusing data.  After a New Order 
 is placed for a patient with no allergies but at least one verified 
 adverse reaction, the words "No Assessment Made" are incorrectly
 displayed under the Verified Allergies header. This should not occur 
 since there is a Verified Adverse Reaction.
