Subject: USERS UNABLE TO VIEW INACTIVE ICD9 CODES

Category:

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the problem where users were unable to modify current
 Problem Category Lists to make it assignable. The users cannot tell if
 the code is Inactive.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD0000000068915    Unable to modify current Problem Category
                       Lists to make it assignable to users
  
    Problem:
    --------
            
    In the GMPL MGT MENU / Create Problem Selection / Build Problem 
    Selection / Create a new name if none exist / view list,
    some codes that display do not show the status of INACTIVE.
    This causes confusion, not allowing the user the ability to
    assign the list to a user, because of the unseen INACTIVE CODES. 
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The issue was caused by the ICD9 code description being longer
    than 60 characters currently allowed on the screen and is truncating
    the INACTIVE status display.
    The routine GMPLBLD was modified via this patch to shorten the 
    length of the ICD9 description to fit on the screen in the View
    mode after the Problem Selection is chosen.
