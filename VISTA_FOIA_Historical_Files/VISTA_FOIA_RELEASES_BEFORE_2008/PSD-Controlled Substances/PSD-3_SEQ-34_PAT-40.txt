Subject: DEA/VA PKI PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in
 collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
 the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
 project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
 Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
 entry system for Schedule II Controlled Substances using digital
 signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
 packages were identified:
 National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
 Kernel V. 8.0
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
 Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
 Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
 Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
  
 This is the CS patch, which provides two new options entitled Digitally
 Signed CS Orders Report [PSD DIGITALLY SIGNED ORDERS] option and
 Digitally Signed OP Released Rx Report [PSD DIG. SIGNED RELEASED RX] 
 option that will be added to the Production Reports [PSD PRODUCTION
 REPORTS] menu. Once DEA's regulations are revised and PKI can be fully
 implemented nationally, sites that choose to activate the PKI
 functionality can use these options to retrieve digitally signed orders
 for controlled substances.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will
 take less than 3 minutes.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
     the Installation Option.
  
  4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSD*3.0*40).
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSD*3.0*40.
  
  6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//" respond NO. 
  
  7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
  
  9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  
 Sites will retrieve VISTA documentation from the following FTP
 addresses.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation
 directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     anonymous.software
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
