Description:
============

 Patient Safety Issue - PSI-06-044
  
 This patch will prevent Discontinued prescriptions from being sent to the 
 external dispense machines.  This particular error only happened for New 
 or Renewed prescriptions that were immediately edited causing the new 
 prescription number to be Discontinued and another number created in its 
 place.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. HD138090  Patient safety issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a New or Renewed prescription is immediately edited for any field 
 that causes the New order to be Discontinued and a newer one to be 
 created, then the Discontinued RX as well as the Newer RX is sent to the 
 External Dispense Machines.  The Discontinued RX is later filled and
 released by the External Machine.  This Discontinued RX was also printing
 on the Patient Signature Log following Laser Labels.
  
 The label print code as well as the 'send to External Device code' was 
 allowing partial fills to be printed and sent to these devices if the 
 partial fill was discontinued during the same user session as they were 
 filled.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct the 'external dispense interface code' and the 'Patient Signature 
 Log code' to recheck the RX Status during the Label print processes and
 prevent the newly Discontinued RX from generating and sending an HL7
 message to the external machines.  This is in agreement with how the laser
 label print process already functions.  The Discontinue Edit code will
 also check for DC'd Rx's and remove them from the string of valid Rx's.
  
 Stop from printing and sending these partial fills if they are 
 discontinued during the same session.  These partial fills will need to 
 be queued to print and then, in a later session, you may discontinue these
 fills if desired.
