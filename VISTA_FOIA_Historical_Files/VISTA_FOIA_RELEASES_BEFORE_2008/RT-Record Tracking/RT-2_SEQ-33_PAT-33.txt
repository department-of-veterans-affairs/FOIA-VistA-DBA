 NOIS Overview
 -------------
 1. NAS-0400-31376     EMPLOYEE RECORDS NOT SENSITIVE
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Certain records are not shown as sensitive records when using the options
    in the Record Tracking menu.  These problems surfaced after DG*5.3*223
    was released on May 1, 2000.  Prior to that release, the patient
    security/sensitivity check was done as part of the post-selection process
    when looking up a patient in the Patient (#2) file.  DG*5.3*223 prevented
    this check if the DIC(0) variable contained an "I", which was the case
    for CIRN.  Record Tracking also contains an "I" when doing these lookups,
    therefore the security check stopped being performed.
  
    If you desire more information about the patient security check, 
    please refer to DG*5.3*249 and DG*5.3*391.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    We have modified routines RTB and RTUTL3 to perform the security
    check using a call to ^DGSEC.  We obtained a new Integration Agreement
    (#3857) to call this routine.
  
 2. FNC-0399-31385     <SUBSCRIPT>WHOTO+5~RTTR1, #4,
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When using the options Request a Transfer from another Institution [RT
    TRANSFER-REQUEST] or Transfer Record to another Institution [RT
    TRANSFER-OUT], the user receives a null-subscript error at
    WHOTO+5^RTTR1 if a remote file room has been set up without a domain.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    If the domain information is missing, text will display explaining
    why the mail message will not be sent.  Modified routine RTTR1.
  
 3. FAV-1199-72450     <UNDEFINED>REMOT^RTDPA3
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When a user enters a question mark (?) to get a help prompt at the
    'REQUEST NOTICE PRINTER: ' prompt while using the option File
    Room/Remote Set-up (Site Mgr) [RT SM-FILE-REMOTE], an undefined error
    occurs at REMOT^RTDPA3.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routine RTDPA3.
   
 4. TAM-0498-30955     REC INQ DISPLAY WRAPS
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Patch RT*2*32 modified the dates in the Record Inquiry [RT
    INQ-INQUIRY] option to display the 4 digit year as part of the
    Year 2000 modifications.  The Record Request Profile section of
    this report now wraps in the Req# column if the request number is
    longer than 5 digits.  That means, a request number of 99,999
    displays fine, while 100,000 causes the data to wrap to the next
    line. 
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The display has been changed to allow more room for the data.
    It is also suggested that sites regularly purge the requests in
    the REQUESTED RECORDS (#190.1) file in order to keep the request
    numbers small.  This can be performed manually by running the
    Purge Data [RT SM-PURGE-DATA] option or automatically by
    scheduling the option Automatic Purge of Record Tracking Data
    [RT SM-PURGE-AUTOMATIC] through taskmanager.  The latter uses the
    profile set in the Purge Data [RT SM-PURGE-DATA] option.  Refer
    to the NOIS message for more information pertaining to the
    purging of request numbers.  Modified routine RTNQ21.
  
 5. POR-0699-52611     borrower set up/change location name
  
    Problem:
    -------
    From the option Borrower Set-up [RT SYS-INDIVD-BORROWERS] it was
    possible to make changes to the names of the Hospital Locations in
    the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    A change has been made to prevent the editing of the Hospital
    Location names from Record Tracking.  Modified the input template
    RT BORROWER SET-UP.
