 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000097503:       Error in ECNTPCE when using GUI
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 1. "Records Failing Transmission to PCE Report" when the report is run
    through the GUI software the users see the following error:
    $ZE= <UNDEFINED>HDR+4^ECNTPCE
     W "FROM "_$P(ECDATE,U)_" TO "_$P(ECDATE,U,2),!!
  
 2. The HELP button on the Report Preview window does not work.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. Modified routine ECRRPT1 to prevent the undefined error.
  
 2. Add source code to EC GUI procedure to display the help message for the 
    Records Failing Transmission to PCE Report.
  
  
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000112546:       Associated Clinic default not showing 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Associated Clinic field does not default to a clinic. It remains unpopulated 
 unless you select a procedure. 
 The associated clinic should work as a default when one is set up in the 
 DSS Unit.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The EC GUI procedure frmEditPatientProc.GetProcedureDefaults was modified to 
 allow the Associated Clinic to be defaulted.
  
 In a DSS unit with only one procedure, the single procedure is highlighted
 in the procedure box and the associated clinic appears in the Clinic box.
 In a unit with multiple procedures, the clinic is not populated until a
 procedure is selected. Selection of one of the procedures will populate 
 the default clinic box.
