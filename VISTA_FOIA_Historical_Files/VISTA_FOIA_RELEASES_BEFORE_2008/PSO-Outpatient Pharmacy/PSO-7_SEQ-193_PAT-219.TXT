Description:
============

 This patch is a follow up for Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Indicator Data
 Capture (CIDC) patch PSO*7*143.
  
 Functional Description:
 ----------------------
 This Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*219 corrects the following issues:
  
 1.  The Application Program Interface (API) that is provided to 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) with the service connection (SC)
 and environmental indicator (EI) questions was not set correctly for non
 service connected (NSC) patients, as a result the following issues were
 reported:
  
 a. In CPRS, the SC related questions were incorrectly prompted for NSC
 patients, and it should not have done so. It should prompt SC/EI question
 only if applicable (remedy ticket 114219).
  
 b. Holders of the PSO COPAY key, the ordering provider, and the finishing
 pharmacist were receiving increased volumes of mailman messages in 
 Outpatient Pharmacy.  Mailman messages were incorrectly sent for NSC
 patients upon refill, new, and renewed orders (remedy ticket 114219).
 These messages have been eliminated.  Mailman messages will or will not be
 generated for the following scenarios:
  
                  SC percentage
                  changed to      E/I question
      Type        to >0%          added?          Mailman Message sent?
      ---------   --------------  -------------   -------------------------

                                                      the prescription is
                                                      released
  
      NSC         Y               N/A             Y if question was not

                                                      prescription is
                                                      released
  
      SC=>0%<50%  N/A             Y               Y  however, NO mailman
                                                       message will be sent
                                                       if any SC/EI = YES
                                                       on the original
                                                       prescription 
  
      For SC>50% prescriptions and if patient has a new SC/EI added, the
      appropriate questions will be asked upon RENEW or COPY of the
      original prescription. At release, a MailMan message will not be sent
      if the patient, patient status, or drug is exempt from copay.
  
 Because the information requested by these Mailman messages are used to 
 determine the final VA copay and/or insurance billable status, the text 
 and format has changed.  The subject line was changed from "RX COPAY 
 STATUS REVIEW NEEDED" to "PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" and the
 body of the message has additional information.  Also, the eligibility and
 disability information is now included after the patient name. The
 following is an example:

 AMITRIPTYLINE 100MG
  
 Due to a change in criteria, additional information listed below is needed
 to determine the final VA copay and/or insurance billable status for this 
 Rx so that appropriate action can be taken by pharmacy personnel.
  
 Is this Rx for a Service Connected Condition?
  
  
 This message has been sent to the provider of record, the pharmacist who
 finished the prescription order, and all holders of the PSO COPAY key.
  
 Providers:
 Please respond with your answer to the question(s) as a reply to this
 message. The prescription will be updated by the appropriate staff.
  
 Staff assigned to update the Prescription responses:
 Please use the RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES option to enter the 
 responses to the questions above, which may result in a Rx copay status
 change and/or the need to remove VA copay charges or may result in a
 charge to the patient's insurance carrier.
  
 Note: The SC question is now asked for Veterans who are SC>49% in order to
 determine if the Rx can be billed to a third party insurance. These 
 Veterans will NOT be charged a VA copay.
  
 Supply and investigational drugs are not charged a VA copay but could be
 reimbursable by third party insurance.
  
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// 
  
 c.  In CPRS, SC/EI related questions were not asked for supply items 
 and investigational drugs (remedy ticket 113764). CPRS and backdoor 
 Outpatient Pharmacy users will be required to complete SC/EI questions for
 supplies and investigational drugs. Supply items and investigational drugs
 could be reimbursable by third party insurance. Also, a VA copay will not
 be charged for these.
  
 2.  During use of Complete Orders from OERR option [PSO LMOE FINISH], the
 default answers for SC/EI's for CPRS SC>50% renewed orders were
 occasionally displaying the previous orders answers during the finish
 process.  A modification was made to display the SC/EI information entered
 during the CPRS renewal process.  This anomaly was encountered during
 unit testing, and there is no associated remedy ticket.
  
 3.  For renewal orders in Complete Orders from OERR option [PSO LMOE 
 FINISH] and Patient Prescription Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR 
 ORDERS], a message was erroneously displayed after the SC/EI prompts for
 SC>50% prescriptions.  The following is an example of the message
 displayed when eligibility is changed or the user enters an up arrows (^)
 at an outpatient classification prompt.  Note that the bracketed
 information can be SERVICE CONNECTED or NON SERVICE CONNECTED depending
 upon the user's response to the question.  Or if the user up arrows (^)
 out of the prompt, the default answer determines the value.
  
            Was treatment for a Service Connected condition? YES// ^
            This Renewal has been designated as [SERVICE CONNECTED]
            Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges' option to
            make corrections.
  
 The "Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges' option to make
 corrections" sentence will no longer be displayed for supply items,
 investigational drugs, and SC>50% patients.  The first sentence will
 remain in order to continue to inform the user of the answer stored for
 the prompt.  Note that similar messages are displayed for environmental
 indicator prompts and this change applies to them. The associated remedy
 tickets are 113931.
  
 4.  For CPRS prescription orders finished using the Complete Orders from
 OERR option [PSO LMOE FINISH] or the Patient Prescription Processing
 option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], a copay related message was displayed for
 SC>50% patients, supply items and investigational drugs.  The following is
 an example, and please note that bracketed information can be either COPAY
 or NO COPAY depending on the providers response to the clinical indicator.
  
      Do you want to enter a Progress Note? No//   NO
  
             SC Percent: 40%
             Disabilities: NONE STATED
  
      This Rx has been flagged by the provider as: [NO COPAY]
  
      Was treatment for Service Connected condition? YES
  
 The "This Rx has been flagged by the provider as: [COPAY/NO COPAY]"
 message will no longer be displayed for SC>50% patients, supply items, 
 and investigational drugs.  There is no associated remedy ticket.
  
 5.  When an edit that creates a new order is performed in Outpatient 
 Pharmacy, a message is displayed to notate that the orderable item was
 changed.  This message is displayed in the Complete Orders from OERR
 [PSO LMOE FINISH] option and the Patient Prescription Processing option
 [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. The following is an example:
  
       CARBAMAZEPINE 100MG TAB
       PROVIDER,NAME           PROVIDER,NAME
       # of Refills: 3
  
       The Pharmacy Orderable Item has changed for this order. Please
       review any existing medication copay exemption defaults carefully
       for appropriateness.
  
       SC Percent: 40%
       Disabilities: NONE STATED
  
       Was treatment for Service Connected condition? YES// 
  
 The above message has been modified to the following:
  
       The Pharmacy Orderable Item has changed for this order. Please
       review any existing SC or Environmental Indicator defaults carefully
       for appropriateness.
  
 Technical Description:
 ----------------------
 The following correlates to each sequence in the Functional Description 
 above and the routines modified are shown in parentheses by each function:
  
 1.  The SCNEW^PSOCP API provided to obtain the SC/EI questions to ask 
 during prescription order etnry was modified to return correct
 information for NSC patients.  By doing so, the following issues were
 eliminated.
  
 a.  The SCNEW^PSOCP API was modified to not return the PSOTG("SC")=""
 variable for NSC patients.  When a null value was previously returned, 
 CPRS was erroneously prompting for SC on NSC patients.
  
 b.  Backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy uses the SCNEW^PSOCP API during the 
 release of a prescription.  Because the null value was returned on NSC 
 patients, Mailman messages for "RX COPAY STATUS REVIEW NEEDED"
 information was sent in error for NSC prescriptions at release of the
 prescription. These issues were corrected with the elimination of the 
 null retuned value for the PSOTG("SC") variable, and the PSOCPE routine
 was modified to show the patient's eligibilities and disabilities as well
 as impart more accurate information.  Also, the subject line of the
 Mailman message changed to "PRESCRIPTION QUESTION REVIEW NEEDED".
  
 c. For supply items and investigational drugs, the SCNEW^PSOCP API was
 modified to return the SC/EI questions that are flagged for the veteran in
 enrollment to be asked during the prescription order process. These types
 of prescriptions could be reimburseable by third party insurance.
  
  2.  Modified renewal routines to always pull default SC/EI answers from
 the data passed on the renewed order from CPRS (PSORENW1, PSORN52,
 PSORN52D). This change affects renewals from CPRS and backdoor Outpatient
 Pharmacy orders.
  
 3.  For SC>50% prescriptions, supply items and investigational drugs,
 eliminated the display of "Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel
 Charges' option to make corrections." sentence (PSOCPB, PSOMLLD2,
 PSOMLLDT), but it will continue to be displayed for SC<50% prescriptions.
  
 4.  For SC>50% prescriptions, supply items and investigational drugs,
 eliminated the display of "This Rx has been flagged by the provider as:
 [COPAY/NO COPAY]" (PSOCPB, PSONEWF, PSORN52).  This message will continue
 to be displayed for SC<50% patients.
  
 5.  For SC 0-100%, supply items and investigational drugs, modified the 
 wording of the message displayed when a prescription edit that creates a 
 new order is performed (PSOCPB, PSONEWF, PSONEWG).
