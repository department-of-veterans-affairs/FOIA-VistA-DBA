  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses several issues that have come up at VAMC stations
 as a result of the release of the ROES 3.0 package. All issues
 addressed in this patch are related to the ROES3.exe application that
 runs from the CPRS Tools menu, as opposed to the ROES3DeskTop.exe
 application. This release includes a new version(3.0.1.1) of the ROES3.exe
 GUI and is compatible with the prior release of ROES 3.0.
  
  Issues addressed in this patch are:
 - A disruption of the parameters passed to the Denver Distribution
   Center(DDC) if the patient's phone number contained a '#' sign.
 - A failure to pass the priority group to the DDC if the patient had a
   calculated ROES eligibility of SC or COM.
 - The "Date of Death" was not being transmitted consistently.
 - The inability to exit the "Display ROES3 Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]"
   option by entering a circumflex(^).
 - The "Display ROES3 Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]" option did not allow
   printing to a slave device.
 - The selection of a proposed eligibility is now mandatory before the
   request for determination will be submitted.
 - The eligibility request date, the requesting user and the date the
   request was acted on were added to the popup message.
 - The removal of the ability to do a patient lookup. The application
   should be run from CPRS Tools where the patient is already known.
  
 In addition, the Audiology and Speech Pathology Service(ASPS) National
 Program Office requested that:
 - PG4 be added as a selectable eligibility. This includes veterans who
   have a Catastrophic Disability and are in Priority Group 4.
 - The text 'Veterans receiving benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 (benefits for
   individuals disabled by treatment or vocational rehabilitation)' be
   added to the help text for category EP3.
  
  
 Functional Change
 =================
 The Black Hills Health Care System reported a problem with the ROES3.exe
 application causing excessive CPU usage on the desktop systems. The
 problem was isolated to the part of the application that waited for
 Internet Explorer to exit and then automatically pulled information from
 the clipboard and formatted it as text for CPRS Notes.  This
 functionality is removed by this patch. By removing this 'listener', the
 user will no longer be able to paste the 'formatted' order information
 into a note in CPRS. Users will continue to have the ability to highlight
 the order information and copy and paste the unformatted information.  The
 DDC is looking into more efficient ways to restore this functionality in a
 future enhancement if it is still desired by the user community.
  
 NOIS references addressed in this patch
 =======================================
  
 MAC-0104-61099
 problem:
 When a '#' sign was returned by the ADD^VADPT call in the patient's phone
 number, it created a break in the URL that was used in establishing a
 browser session to the ROES 3.0 web application from CPRS Tools. This
 usually showed up as an eligibility error at the DDC.
  
 resolution:
 Routine RMPFRPC1 was modified to screen out any special characters from
 the values used by the URL in ROES3.exe. The executable also has an added
 function that verifies the removal of those characters.
  
 SBY-0404-30089
 problem:
 When the user attempted to print the ROES 3 Eligibility Request list to
 a slave printer, it produced an error at LIST^RMPFDE2 and didn't print.
  
 resolution:
 When the print routine was updated, the slave printer part was overlooked.
 This problem has been fixed in routine RMPFDE2.
  
 WRJ-0104-10319 and MAC-0304-61626
 problem:
 ROES3 message boxes or the application itself were coming up behind the
 CPRS screens.
  
 resolution:
 A splash screen was added to the ROES3.exe application and it will give
 focus to the ROES 3.0 application in most instances. Situations may
 exist where other applications have priority.

 ===============
 ROES 3.0  (RMPF*3.0)
  
 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
 =======================================================================
  
 The following routines and program have been modified:
  
 1. RMPFDE2 - This routine was modified to allow Prosthetics and
    Sensory Aids Service(PSAS) users to exit the 'Display ROES3
    Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]' option by entering '^' as well as the
    <Q>uit. The print of the eligibility request list to a slave printer
    was not working and has now been fixed.
  
 2. RMPFDE3 - 'Eligibility' was added to the VistA message text.
    Catastrophically disabled veterans in Priority Group 4 have
    been added to the selectable eligibilities.
  
 3. RMPFRPC0 - In the original release priority groups 1 and 2 were
    omitted from the message transmission because the priority group
    was not obtained before the determination of SC or COM eligibility.
    This oversight has been corrected.  Also, in the pop-up message
    from PSAS, the eligibility request date, the requesting user and the
    date action was taken were added.
  
 4. RMPFRPC1 - A section was added to remove special characters
    (@#%?&/\) from the values that are used in the URL. Also, the
    failure of the 'Date of Death' to be transmitted to the DDC has
    been corrected.
  
 5. The ROES 3 CPRS Tools option executable(ROES3.exe) was modified
    to:
    -Correct the spelling of 'priority'.
    -The title of the selection box was changed to 'You must select a
     Proposed Eligibility', and a selection was made mandatory.
    -A splash screen was added to the executable to help alleviate the
     problem of the application not getting focus in front of the CPRS
     screens. Circumstances may still exist where the CPRS screen has
     priority. In those situations the user can <Alt><Tab> to view the
     ROES screen.
    -The portion of the module that was used by developers to lookup a
     patient was removed. That section was not meant to be used by
     field stations.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
 ROES users should be off the system while these routines are being
 installed. This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to
 minimize disruption. Installation will take approximately 5 minutes
 or more, depending on the CPRS Tools menu structure at your site.
  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  Answer
      YES to the prompt 'Want to Continue with Load? YES//'.  This
      will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE
      SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
      set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMPF*3.0*1):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes to routines that will be made when
          the patch is installed.
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
          Global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RMPF*3.0*1.
  
  6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      YES//", respond "NO."
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond "YES". When prompted to select the
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
           Display ROES3 Eligibility Requests   RMPFDE2
           ROES3 OPTION ACCESS                  RMPF ROES3
  
  8.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0.'
  
  9.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation is complete.
  
 10.  Retrieve the file RMPF_3_P1.ZIP and extract file ROES3.exe.
      ROES3DeskTop.exe is not included in this patch because it is
      unchanged from the initial release.
  
 11.  All existing instances of the ROES3.exe need to be replaced, 
      regardless of whether they reside on server(s) or workstation(s).
      To do this, copy the new ROES3.exe file to those locations, 
      replacing the existing version. (Take care not to inadvertently copy
      this file over any existing ROES3DeskTop.exe files) When this is
      completed properly, the command line option from CPRS Tools should
      continue to work without any modifications.
