Subject: Error in API RMPRPIU3, ERROR = 11 / PVENL2+12 in routine RMPRPIYR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 THIS PATCH ADDRESSES TWO ISSUES:
  
 1. Delete field 19 (bogus entry) for RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR
    (#660) file in ^DD which conflicts with HCPS (#4.1) field of same file,
    both using node 0, piece 22.
  
 2. Prevent dual entries in PROSTHETIC INVENTORY TRANSACTION (#661.6) file
    and PROSTHETIC CURRENT STOCK (#661.7) file from having a time stamp one
    second apart for "return-in" when piece 6 of PROSTHETIC TRANSACTION
    PATIENT ISSUE (#661.63) file is null.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD103925     Error in API RMPRPIU3, ERROR = 11
        
    Problem:
    --------
    The soft error is caused by a bogus field (#19) definition for 
    RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file (using same node/piece as
    field 4.1), causing an unresolved data retrieval when using GETS^DIQ.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A post-install routine was developed to delete this bogus field (#19) 
    from file ^DD at sites.
  
 2. HD111159     <UNDEFINED> PVENL2+12^RMPRPIYR when TRANS-
                 FERRING STOCK from LOC to LOC 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When returning stock issue via Edit/Delete Issue From Stock 
    [EDIT/DELETE STOCK ISSUE] option, the suspense file related to
    PROSTHETIC TRANSACTION PATIENT ISSUE (#661.63) file did not have a date
    in piece 6, causing the delete process to file different time stamps
    when filing entries to PROSTHETIC INVENTORY TRANSACTION (#661.6) file
    and PROSTHETIC CURRENT STOCK (#661.7) file, causing subsequent problems
    with issues, transfers and reporting.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines RMPRPIYF and RMPRPIU3 to insure the same time
    stamping when creating entries in PROSTHETIC INVENTORY TRANSACTION
    (#661.6) file and PROSTHETIC CURRENT STOCK (#661.7) file.
