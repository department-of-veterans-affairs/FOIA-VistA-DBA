Associated patches: (v)QAC*2*8     <<= must be installed BEFORE `QAC*2*10'

Subject: To resolve NOISs for Adhoc Reporting and New Patient Entry.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  
 The QAC Adhoc Report does not print for an individual Issue Code.  This
 problem was reported in NOIS CIN-0199-41038.  It was also found that the
 report does not correctly print for a range of Issue Codes.
  
 It was reported that the Reports of Contact for which there is no patient
 involved sometimes have a Period of Service listed.  This occurs when a
 Report of Contact with no patient is entered after a ROC with a patient in
 the same session.  The problem is that the Period of Service field in
 these cases was pulled from the previous entry.  This problem was reported
 in NOIS LOU-0199-41585.
  
 Changes have been made in routines QACEDIT and QACNEW to remove direct
 global look-ups in the INSTITUTION file (#4).  These changes are not in
 response to any NOIS message.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
        CIN-0199-41038
        LOU-0199-41585
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other DHCP users will not be affected by this patch.
  
     Enter New Contact        [QAC NEW]
     Edit Contact Record      [QAC EDIT]
     Ad Hoc Report            [QAC ADHOC]
