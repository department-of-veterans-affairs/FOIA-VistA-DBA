Subject: HARTFORD/USAA SETTLEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The VA has been in litigation with Hartford and USAA for nonpayment of 
 third party health insurance claims since 1994 and has reached a 
 settlement agreement to accept payment of the claims VA has asserted from 
 1/1/95 to 12/31/01, the settlement date range.  This software is being 
 issued as the cease and desist part of the settlement agreement only.  In 
 the cease and desist part of the agreement VA is to discontinue all 
 collection activity of all third party bills for care provided during the 
 settlement date range for the involved insurance carriers.  Additionally 
 VA is to discontinue all collection activity of outstanding first party 
 receivables where the VA was aware the patient had third party coverage 
 by one of the involved insurance carriers for dates of care in the 
 settlement date range.

 Functional Description
 ----------------------
 Included in this IB patch are 4 new options contained in one new menu.  
 The menu is not assigned to existing IB menus and must be assigned to 
 users individually.  The main menu is called "Hartford/USAA Settlement 
 Menu" [IBE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT MENU].  The options to complete the 
 settlement agreement should be accomplished in the order they are listed 
 within the menu.  Once one option is completed, users will not be allowed 
 to go back to a previous step.  Prior to being able to accomplish any of 
 the options, the receivables need to be returned from Regional Council.  
 Regional Council will automatically return all bills they have identified 
 as being part of this settlement agreement.
  
 1. Find and Close Hartford/USAA Bills [IBE FIND SETTLEMENT BILLS], locked 
 with the IB SUPERVISOR key.  
 This option, when invoked, will do a search of the INSURANCE COMPANY 
 (#36) file to attempt to find all insurance companies involved in the 
 settlement.  A list of the insurance companies found will then be 
 displayed to the user.  At that point the user can add or remove 
 insurance companies from the list.  When done with the selection users 
 should select the FINISHED option.  At this point users will be asked if 
 they want to run this option in TEST mode.  TEST mode will search for 
 bills that might potentially be closed and report any errors the software 
 may encounter.  It will also allow users to review the impact to their 
 receivables and resolve some of the error issues prior to running the 
 option in REAL mode.  Users may run this option as many times in TEST 
 mode as they choose.  After the option has been run in REAL mode, this 
 option can no longer be executed.  If a user attempts to run the option 
 in REAL mode before running it in TEST mode, the software will display a 
 warning to caution the user.
   
 The list of insurance companies the software will automatically identify 
 is based on the insurance company name containing the following text:
  
      HARTFORD
      KIRK VAN
      KIRK-VAN
      KIRKE
      RETIRED OFFICERS AS
      SEABURY
      TROA
      USAA
  
 All reports produced by this settlement are sent in MailMan, allowing 
 sites to print the reports or view them.  The MailMan messages are sent 
 to the user that invoked the option to produce the report and to the IB 
 ERROR mail group.
  
 2. Manually Resolve Bills for Settlement [IBE RESOLVE SETTLEMENT BILLS].  
 This option can only be invoked after the first option has been run in 
 REAL mode.  Users will be allowed to select any bills/charges that had 
 errors and decrease them as part of this settlement agreement.  It is 
 important that users use this option and not any other options to close 
 out bills associated with this settlement agreement, as this option will 
 add the adjustments to the totals reports.  Users will be allowed to use 
 this option to fully or partially close a bill, as appropriate for both 
 1st and 3rd party bills.
  
 3. Complete Settlement Processing [IBE COMPLETE SETTLEMENT], locked with 
 the IB SUPERVISOR key.  
 This option can only be invoked once and only after the first option has 
 been completed.  Users should complete the first option, manually adjust 
 any bills with the second option, and then use this option to complete 
 the processing.  This option will produce the summary totals report as 
 well as roll them up to a national reporting.
  
 4. First Party Charge Inquiry [IBE 1ST PARTY CHARGE INQUIRY].  
 This option is included to allow users to view charge information in the 
 INTEGRATED BILLING (#350) file.  They will be asked for a charge ID 
 number.  First party charges can be combined onto one bill number in AR.  
 The AR bill may contain some charges that are not part of this settlement 
 and should not be adjusted.  Therefore, all references to first party 
 charges are based on the charge ID.  With this option, users will be able 
 to view charge information in order to make a decision to include this in 
 the settlement.  The charge information will include Type of Charge as 
 well as Date(s) of Service covered by the charge.
  
  
  
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 This patch contains one new menu that must be individually assigned to 
 users, as it is not added to any existing menu.  The new menu 
 'Hartford/USAA Settlement Menu' [IBE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT MENU] contains 
 4 new options.  The new options are:
  
 1 Find and Close Hartford/USAA Bills    [IBE FIND SETTLEMENT BILLS]
 2 Manually Resolve Bills for Settlement [IBE RESOLVE SETTLEMENT BILLS]
 3 Complete Settlement Processing        [IBE COMPLETE SETTLEMENT]
   First Party Charge Inquiry            [IBE 1ST PARTY CHARGE INQUIRY]
  
 All reports produced by this settlement are sent in MailMan, allowing 
 sites to print the reports or view them.  The MailMan messages are sent 
 to the user that invoked the option to produce the report and the IB 
 ERROR mail group.
  
 Also included in this patch are 5 new routines.  The routines store data 
 in the ^XTMP global with a purge date set for 90 days.  This will allow 
 time for the completion of the litigation settlement processing.
  
  
 A future patch will be issued to remove these options and routines.
  
 If you run ^XINDEX on routine IBELIT3, you will receive the following
 error messages:
  
        I IBAR<1 W !!,"Error:",!,$P($T(@(-IBAR)^IBELIT2),";",3) Q
    P+13         F - Invalid or wrong number of arguments to a function.
        I $P(IBAR,"^",3)<0 W !!,"Warning:",!,$P($T(@(-$P(IBAR,"^",3))^IBELIT2),
         ";",3)
    P+14         F - Invalid or wrong number of arguments to a function.
        I IBAR<1 W !!,"Error:",!,$P($T(@(-IBAR)^IBELIT2),";",3) Q
    F+7          F - Invalid or wrong number of arguments to a function.
        I $P(IBAR,"^",3)<0 W !!,"Warning:",!,$P($T(@(-$P(IBAR,"^",3))^IBELIT2),
         ";",3)
    F+8          F - Invalid or wrong number of arguments to a function.
  
 The error messages are a result of ^XINDEX's inability to understand
 indirection inside the $TEXT function.  These lines of code have been
 tested and will function without error.
