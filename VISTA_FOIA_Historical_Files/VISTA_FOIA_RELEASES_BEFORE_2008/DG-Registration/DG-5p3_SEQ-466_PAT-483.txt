Subject: UR BULLETIN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

   The VHA Reasonable Charges Policy Group is requesting additional 
   information to appear on the UR Admission Bulletin to assist in
   identifying the proper episodes of care that are related to an inpatient
   admission.  According to Medicare 72-Hour Rule, for billing purposes,
   charges for outpatient services performed within 3 days (72 hours)
   previous to the date and time of an admission should be combined with
   charges for the inpatient stay.
  
   Data or information added to the UR Bulletin will assist in identifying:  
  
   1) An outpatient E&M service received by the patient within 3 days of the 
      inpatient admission date and time.
   2) Diagnostic tests and services (lab, x-ray) received by the patient 
      within 3 days of the inpatient admission date and time. 
   3) Applicable services received by the patient within 3 days of the
      inpatient admission date and time. 
  
   Data items agreed upon by the Reasonable Charges Policy group as needed
   by the UR Staff in order to make the proper determination of outpatient
   events and encounters related to inpatient stays are:
          Clinic Location
          Encounter Date & Time (visit date)
  
   For each visit within 72 hours previous to the date and time of
   admission, a line will be added to the UR Bulletin, giving the visit
   location and date and time of visit.  An example of what this line looks
   like follows.
