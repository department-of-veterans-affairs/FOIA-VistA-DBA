============

   PREREQUISITES: none
  ===========================================================================
   
   All sites should load this patch regardless of their operating system.
   This patch is primarily for support of MSM-NT version 4.3 and OpenM-NT
   NextGen 2.0.
   
   This patch should be installed during off-peak hours when network mail
   activity is low. This patch can be installed with users on the system.
  ===========================================================================
   
  DEFINITIONS:
        AXP = Dec AXP system running DSM on VMS
        MSM = PC running MSM on DOS
        MSM-NT = PC running MSM on NT Version 4.3
        OpenM-NT = Dec ALPHA or PC running OpenM NextGen 2.0 or Cache on NT.
   
  INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
  AXP:  Some of these routines might be mapped, so you will need to disable
        mapping for the affected routines.
   
  MSM-NT: Where TCP/IP Mail is running, kill the Mail listener. In the Manager
        account D ^KILLJOB and kill the job who's routine name is XMRINETD.
   
  OpenM-NT: Where TCP/IP Mail is running, kill the Mail listener.  In the
        Manager account D ^RESJOB and kill the job who's routine name is XMRONT
        or it may be %ZISTCP, in either case it will own device |TCP|25.
   
    1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
    2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the Transport
        global.
    3.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and installed
        at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3  Print Transport Global
           4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5  Backup a Transport Global
           6  Install Package(s)
   
  MSM:  Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to other CPUs?'.
        Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
   
  AXP:  After patch has been installed, rebuild your map set.
   
        ***AXP and MSM sites are done with the installation.***
        ***The rest of the install is for OpenM-NT and MSM-NT.***
   
  OpenM-NT: In the Production account job the Mail listener, J ^XMRONT.
        Also, schedule the option XMRONT to start everytime the system is
        rebooted.  Do the following from the EVE menu:
   
        Select Systems Manager Menu Option: Taskman Management
