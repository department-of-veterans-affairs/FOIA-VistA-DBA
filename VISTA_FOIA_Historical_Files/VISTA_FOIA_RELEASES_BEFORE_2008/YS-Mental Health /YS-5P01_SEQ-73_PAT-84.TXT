 Patch YS*5.01*84 addresses three issues within the Mental Health software.
 
 1. In the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), ITEM NUMBER field (#1), TEXT sub-field 
 (#2) for the entry the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI2) a period has 
 been added to the end of each response number.  This will allow a reminder
 to be built by the Clinical Reminder software.  Here is an example of the
 edit made to ITEM NUMBER 2 of the BDI2 instrument using a FILEMAN inquiry:
 
 Before patch:
 
 ITEM NUMBER: 2                          VALID RESPONSE SET: 0123X
  TEXT: PESSIMISM
   
  0 I am not discouraged about my future.
  1 I feel more discouraged about my future than I used to be.
  2 I do not expect things to work out for me.
  3 I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse.
 
 After patch:
 
 ITEM NUMBER: 2                          VALID RESPONSE SET: 0123X
  TEXT: PESSIMISM
   
  0. I am not discouraged about my future.
  1. I feel more discouraged about my future than I used to be.
  2. I do not expect things to work out for me.
  3. I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse.
 
 
 2. In the Mental Health Assistant GUI version 1.0.2.9 when using the mouse 
 scroll button in the left-hand pane, the pane freezes at times.  Returning 
 to the desktop the mouse arrow suddenly becomes unresponsive to mouse 
 movements and begins performing the movements that should have occurred in 
 the Mental Health Assistant - in the same area of the screen where the lists 
 of tests was.  This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10 to properly navigate 
 the large amounts of patient psychological test data users may have.
 
 3. The instrument ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIPS (AOR) has been made
 non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the MH INSTRUMENT file
 (#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).
