Subject: 55 INCOME DATA MISSING ADDED RULES UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the Income Inconsistency checks of the Load/Edit 
 Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] option.  There have been several 
 changes to the business rules on when a veteran is required to provide 
 income information on screen 9.  Currently, if there is no income entered 
 on screen 9 (the fields are null), the consistency checker performs the 
 following checks:
  
    o The veteran has died during the previous year
    o The veteran's service connected percentage is 50% or greater OR the 
      veteran's primary eligibility is SC 50-100%
    o The veteran has agreed to pay the deductible on their current 
      primary means test
  
 If none of the above conditions are met, the 55 INCOME DATA MISSING error 
 is reported by the consistency checker
  
 The following additional rules are being added to the consistency 
 checker.  These additional conditions will bring the consistency checker 
 in line with the checks performed for means test requirements.  If any of 
 these additional conditions are met, the 55 INCOME DATA MISSING error 
 will not be generated when there is no data entered on income screen 9:
  
    o The veteran is receiving a disability retirement from the
      military
    o The veteran is eligible for Medicaid
    o The veteran is in a Domiciliary Ward
    o The veteran is a Purple Heart recipient
    o The veteran's POW indicator is YES
    o If the veteran's service connected percentage is 0%, then check
      the following additional rules:
      -  And the veteran is receiving a VA Pension
      -  And the veteran has as a secondary eligibility of: Aid &
         Attendance OR Housebound OR NSC, VA Pension OR
         Mexican Border War OR World War I
  
 Additionally, the description of the 55 INCOME DATA MISSING is being 
 modified to read:
  
 "This inconsistency results if all of the income questions on screen 9 
 are null and the patient has not declined to provide their income 
 information on his/her last Means Test (yet screen 9 is turned on for 
 this type of patient).  
   
 You will not be able to edit the inconsistency by using the checker 
 option. You must edit the data on load/edit screen 9.
   
 Note: Collection of income data or agreement to pay the maximum medical 
 care copayments is mandatory for all NSC and 0% SC noncompensable patients
 who do not have any special eligibilities.  This data will be utilized for
 IVM (Income Verification Matching) with the IRS.  Although you may turn
 this consistency check off, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED it remain ON."

 There are no E3Rs associated with this patch
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS message(s):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 ISA-0303-11478 INCONSISTENCY 55 INCOME DATA MISSING INCORRECT
  
  
 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ----------------------------
 ISA-0303-11478 INCONSISTENCY 55 INCOME DATA MISSING INCORRECT
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The 55 INCOME DATA MISSING inconsistency results if none of the income 
 questions on screen 9 of the Load/Edit Patient Data screen are answered 
 and the patient has not agreed to pay the deductible.  Sites are 
 indicating that they are getting the 55 INCOME DATA MISSING error for 
 veterans who do not require income information.  Unless they enter a "0" 
 into the income fields, they cannot clear the error.  By entering a "0" 
 in these cases, they feel the veteran's income data is misrepresentative 
 and that they should not have to enter a "0" to clear this error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 This patch updates the business rules for the 55 INCOME DATA MISSING 
 error to bring the consistency checker in line with the checks being 
 performed by the means test requirements.
