 This patch fixes the following problems:
  
 1) The Women's Health (WH) package automatically adds non-veteran female
    patients and their radiology procedures to the WH database if the link
    to the Radiology/NM package is set to YES in the WV SITE PARAMETER file
    (#790.02) for that facility. Some facilities do not wish to track
    non-veteran patients.
  
    This patch will add new site parameters that will allow each facility
    to add none, some or all non-veteran patients and their procedure data
    sent from the Radiology/NM and Laboratory package links. Facilities can
    allow patient and procedure data for certain non-veterans to be passed
    to the WH package from Radiology/NM and Laboratory based on the
    patient's Primary Eligibility Code (File #2, Field .361). 
  
    Also, the patient's eligibility code will now appear on several displays.
  
    The post-installation routine (WV10PST) will send a mail message with
    instructions on how to set these new site parameters to each default
    case manager defined in FILE #790.02.
  
    Option used to enter new site parameters:
      - Edit Site Parameters [WV EDIT SITE PARAMETERS]
  
    Options that will display patient's eligibility code:
      - Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA]
      - Patient Profile [WV PATIENT PROFILE]
      - Browse Patients With Needs Past Due [WV BROWSE NEEDS PAST DUE]
      - Add a NEW Procedure [WV ADD A NEW PROCEDURE]
      - Edit a Procedure [WV EDIT PROCEDURE]
      - Print a Procedure [WV PRINT A PROCEDURE]
      - Add a Refusal of Treatment [WV REFUSED PROC-ADD]
      - Edit a Refusal of Treatment [WV REFUSED PROC-EDIT]
      - Add a New Notification [WV ADD A NEW NOTIFICATION]
      - Edit a Notification [WV EDIT NOTIFICATION]
      - Patient Profile Including Errors [WV PATIENT PROFILE W/ERRORS]
      - Add(Accession) a NEW Procedure [WV LAB ADD A NEW PROCEDURE]
      - Edit Accessioned Procedure [WV LAB EDIT ACCESSION]
      - Edit a Procedure Result [WV LAB EDIT PROCEDURE RESULT]
      - Automatically Load Patients [WV AUTOLOAD PATIENTS]
  
 The Import Radiology/NM Exams [WV IMPORT RAD/NM EXAMS] option will now prompt
 the user to include non-veteran patients based on the patient's
 eligibility code.

 2) The Browse Patients With Needs Past Due [WV BROWSE NEEDS PAST DUE]
    output will now display the patient's age and veteran status. The
    patient's age was requested in E3R 13163.
  
    The Automatically Load Patients [WV AUTOLOAD PATIENTS] output will now
    display the patient's age and veteran status. There is no E3R
    associated with this enhancement. The date range selected by the user
    will now appear in the report header as well. No NOIS or E3R is 
    associated with this change.
  
  Code Changes:
  =============
  Routine: WVBRNED1, WVGETALL
  
 3) The Automatically Load Patients [WV AUTOLOAD PATIENTS] option did not
    add a patient to the WV PATIENT file (#790) if that patient's only
    patient activity was on the end date of the date range selected by the
    user. After this patch is installed, the option will add the patient if
    her only patient activity is on the end date of the date range
    selected.
