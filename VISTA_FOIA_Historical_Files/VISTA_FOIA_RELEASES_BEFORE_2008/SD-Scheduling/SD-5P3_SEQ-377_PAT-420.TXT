Subject: AAC TRANSMISSION REPORT ENHANCEMENTS - ADDITIONAL EWL FIELDS.

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the EWL Phase II enhancements as identified through
 a list of requirements provided by the EWL user group. The SD WAIT LIST 
 (#409.3) file is transmitted to Austin Automation Center(AAC) on a
 bi-monthly basis. New fields that are already present in file SD WAIT LIST
 (#409.3) are added to the transmission with this patch. This patch updates
 the Electronic Wait List (EWL) transmission to the Austin Automation 
 Center (AAC).  In essence, this patch adds a number of data elements to 
 the bi-monthly transmission of EWL information from the site to the Austin
 Automation Center.  All of the changes involved with this patch are "under
 the hood," so your users will not see any difference in functionality or
 on-screen presentation. This will ensure proper reporting is accomplished
 for the Electronic Wait List within the Veterans Administration. The patch
 includes new fields in file SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) introduced in patches
 SD*5.3*327, SD*5.3*394, and SD*5.3*415.
