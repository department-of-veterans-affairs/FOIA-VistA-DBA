Subject: Merge X-REF fix

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch will add a check of all XREF's that are used in Phase II to 
 ensure that they consist of all file entries.
  
 Phase II of the merge process uses x-ref's to merge the data if a valid 
 x-ref exist.  A new x-ref was created on file 52 that wasn't a full x-ref 
 yet merge used it to merge the data (resulting in some records only getting 
 partially merged). XT*7.3*73 provides a check that ensures that if merge
 is going to use a x-ref, it is a full file x-ref.  In testing the merge
 "setup" in Portland it was identified that three other files were being 
 merged using x-ref's that couldn't be verified as full file.  If you have
 noticed problems with any of the 4 files listed below, this patch should
 fix those problems.  Merge Developers will work with developers of these
 files to ensure that past merges are checked for dangling pointers.
  
         File 351, "ACT" x-ref was used
         File 430, "E" x-ref was used
         File 52, "APSOD" x-ref was used
         File 133.8, "AP" x-ref was used

      DO NOT need to stop TaskMan.  All active merge process should be 
      allowed to COMPLETE prior to installing this patch.
  
      2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you may need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
      3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution 
      System) package onto your system.
     
      4.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options: 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
  
      5.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
             Install Package(s)  
  
             Select INSTALL NAME: XT*7.3*73
                                  =========
        Logons DO NOT need to be inhibited.
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
                                                              ==

      6.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
      completion.
