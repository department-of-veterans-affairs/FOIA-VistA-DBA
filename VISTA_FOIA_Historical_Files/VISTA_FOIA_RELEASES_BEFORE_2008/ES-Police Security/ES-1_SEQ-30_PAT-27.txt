  *****************************************************************
 This patch makes changes to several files. 
  A.  1) In the ESP DAILY JOURNAL file (#916) a new field has been added.
         .5        FACILITY   
         The new facility field points to the Medical Center Division 
         file (#40.8). This allows the journal to be associated to a 
         defined division. The Facility field will display upon lookups.
 
      2) The .01 DATE field has also been expanded to accept Time. The 
         time entry is not required and will still accept just a date.
         Note: Sites are able to enter multiple entries for the same 
               date by quoting the additional dates. 
               Example "102399" or "10-23-1999"
 
  B.  In the ESP EVIDENCE file (#910.8) a new field has been added.
      .5        FACILITY   
      The new facility field points to the Medical Center Division file 
       (#40.8)
      This allows the journal to be associated to a defined division. The 
       Facility field will display upon lookups.
  C.  In the ESP POLICE REGISTRATION LOG file (#910.2) a new field has been 
      added.
      .08     FACILITY
      The new facility field points to the Medical Center Division file 
       (#40.8)
      This allows the journal to be associated to a defined division. The 
       Facility field will display upon lookups.
  D. In the ESP OFFENSE REPORT file (#912) a new field has been added
       .07    FACILITY
      The new facility field points to the Medical Center Division file 
       (#40.8)
      This allows the journal to be associated to a defined division. The 
       Facility field will display upon lookups.
 
 This patch also brings in the new file ESP CRIME DATA-BY-FACILITY (#912.3)
      This file is similar to file ESP CRIME DATA (#912.4) but breaks the 
      reports up by facility.      
 
 In addition to the Files that have been modified the following templates 
 have been changed to take advantage of the Facility fields.
 [ESP CREATE JOURNAL]		'Create a Daily Journal'	Type: input
 [ESP DAILY SHIFT JOURNAL]	'Print Shift Journal'		Type: print
 [ESP DAILY JOURNAL STATISTICS]	'Daily Journal Statistics'	Type: print
 [ESP EVIDENCE/PROPERTY ADD/EDIT] 'Create/Edit Evidence/Property Record'
 								Type: input
 New templates added are.
 [ESP CASE ASSIGNMENT OPEN/FAC]					Type: sort
 [ESP CASE BY DIVISION]						Type: sort
 
 
 New options included in this patch are:
 
 ESP CASE ASSIGNMENT ALL/FAC      
     This submenu option allows VA Police staff to print a Case
     Assignment Register displaying all investigations within a selected time
     frame, regardless of case status by Facility.          
 
 ESP CASE ASSIGNMENT OPEN/FAC  
     This submenu option allows VA Police staff to print a Case
     Assignment Register displaying only those investigations currently with 
     the Status of Open by the Facility.               
     
 ESP DELETE FACILITY CRIME STAT   
     This option allows persons to delete crime statistics in the
     ESP CRIME DATA-BY-FACILITY file for a specific time period.     
 
 ESP FACILITY REPORTS
     This menu option holds all the specialized options for Facility
     reports.                           
 
 ESP GENERATE CRIME STAT BY FAC   
     This option allows persons to generate crime statistics for a
     specific time period by Facility.              
 
 ESP PRINT FAC CRIME REPORT  
     This option allows persons to print a crime report for a
     specific time period and Facility.  You must first run the Generate Crime
     Statistics option before you can print a crime report

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take 
  less than 2 minutes.
  
                       **Warning** 
 When an option is included in the patch build, the question REBUILD MENUS
 is asked as a PRE-INSTALL question. If you choose to have KIDs rebuild the 
 menus it will happen at the end of the build installation and may take several
 hours.  
 
 Note: Most sites have a nightly batch job that rebuilds the menus so if
 you queued the installations ensure that it will complete prior to the 
 batch job.  Or, if you are installing several builds, wait until the last one
 to use the KIDs rebuild functionality.
 
                          ****
 
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
      SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
      set at this time. 
  
   3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation menu. 
 
  
   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*27.)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option creates a MailMan
         message that will backup all current routines on your system
         that would be replaced by the Packages in this Transport 
         Global. Those components that are not routines must be backed
         up separately if they need to be preserved.  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option lets
         you compare the components of a Transport Global, that is 
         currently loaded in the XTMP global, to your current system. 
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
         verify checksums for the components of a Transport Global and
         will report any checksums that are incorrect. 
      d. Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the
         contents of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in
         the ^XTMP global. 
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*27.
  
   6. You may want to disable the menu options affected by this patch. When 
      prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
      YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the actions out of order, 
      enter the following: 
   
      ESP DAILY OPERATIONS JOURNAL         Daily Operations Journal
      ESP VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS                 Vehicle Registrations
      ESP EVIDENCE PROPERTY LOOKUP        Lookup Evidence/Property Record
   
   7. If a routine was unmapped as part of step 2, it should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
