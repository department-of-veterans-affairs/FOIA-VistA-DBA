Subject: MODIFY PHARMACY API THAT RETURNS SUSPENDED STATUS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 A site reported a problem with the Outpatient prescription status of 
 SUSPENDED. In some cases, it was being interpreted as being 
 non-refillable. A patient safety incident was entered regarding this 
 problem. The interim solution is to modify the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 
 (OP) Applications Program Interface (API) that returns the prescription
 status. Instead of returning SUSPENDED, the API will return ACTIVE/SUSP. 
 There will be no change to the display in the OP application.
