Description: 
============

  NOIS addressed with this patch: CTX-0802-72619
   
  With the implementation of the EDI Electronic billing solution, it became 
  apparent that there was a need to provide a more efficient means of 
  entering the large numbers of provider ID's that are required for specific
  insurance carriers.  These are the ID numbers entered in Box 24K on the
  HCFA 1500 form.  The IDs used in this patch description are only 
  examples.  The IDs your BCBS payer has assigned to your site may
  have a different format.
   
  Patch IB*2.0*200 provides a way to batch enter provider ID's from a 
  delimited or fixed length file for those providers whose name resides in 
  the NEW PERSON (#200) file.  
   
  This patch also modifies the existing way in which the provider ID is 
  entered using the Manual INSURANCE CO BATCH ID entry action located within
  the PROVIDER ID MAINTENANCE  [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT ] option.  The option
  currently is very time consuming as it searches multiple files for the
  selection of provider names.  The manual Provider ID entry has been 
  modified to eliminate this time consuming search for provider 
  information.  Instructions for using the Manual procedure are listed
  later in this document.  Refer to NOIS CTX-0802-72619.
   
  Procedure for entering Provider ID's using a fixed length or delimited file:
   
  You will need to obtain a file of provider data.  This may come from the
  insurance company but will probably be one that you have created.  The
  file must contain, at a minimum, the provider Name, SSN and Provider ID in
  order for the automated filing of the ID number to work.  The SSN must
  match exactly with the NEW PERSON (#200) file but the name does not.  
  Additional fields may exist in your file but will be ignored by the
  INS CO BATCH ID ENTRY option.  Depending on how you obtain your file of
  provider data, you may end up with one of the following three most likely
  situations:
  1)  a file with fixed length fields
  2)  a file with comma delimited fields
  3)  a spreadsheet file (e.g. Excel or Lotus)
   
  If the file you have is a spreadsheet, you will need to convert it
  to one of the other two types, preferably comma delimited.  For Excel 
  files this can be done with 'Save As' and selecting CSV(MS-DOS) as
  the file type.  Consult your spreadsheet's Help text for more 
  information on saving the file in this format.
   
  This file will then need to be copied to a directory or folder on your 
  production system so that it can be read by the automated loading 
  function.  Consult your IRM staff if you are not familiar with this process.
   
  Format examples:
   
  The records in a fixed length file will look something like this-
  333445555JONES,JENNIFER         JJ398238  10/15/1994UROLOGY
  123894321KEISER,WILLIAM JAMES   WK714347  07/04/1986CARDIOLOGY
  484777666MACKINTOSH,CRAIG       CM545456  02/14/1999OTOLARYNGOLOGY
  
  while the records in a comma delimited file will look something like-
   
  333445555,"JONES,JENNIFER",JJ398238,10/15/1994,UROLOGY
  123894321,"KEISER,WILLIAM J",WK714347,07/04/1986,CARDIOLOGY
  484777666,"MACKINTOSH,CRAIG",CM545456,02/14/1999,OTOLARYNGOLOGY
   
  The order of the fields doesn't matter since you will describe
  their position when prompted by the INS CO BATCH ID ENTRY option.
  Extra fields not used by this option will not matter.  For example,
  Specialty which is shown in the examples above will be ignored.

  You can compare the provider name from your data file with the name

  some research.
  If there is any data missing that would prevent a particular entry from 
  being added to the IB BILLING PRACTITIONER ID file (#355.9), the record
  will not be displayed for filing.  When the processing is complete, a

  the good records.
