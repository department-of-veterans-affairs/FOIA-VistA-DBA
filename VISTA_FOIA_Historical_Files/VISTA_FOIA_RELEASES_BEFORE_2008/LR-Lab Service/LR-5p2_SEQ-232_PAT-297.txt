 This multi-build patch contains four Provider Systems patches to support 
 Code Set Versioning (CSV) under the Health Information Portability and 
 Accountability Act (HIPAA).  These patches should be installed together 
 under a single KIDS build: CSV_PS_1_0.KID
  
 The four patches included in this single KIDS build are :
                   LR*5.2*297       CSV-Laboratory
                   RA*5.0*38        CSV-Radiology
                   RMPR*3.0*74      CSV-Prosthetics
                   SR*3.0*116       CSV-Surgery
  
 They contain routines, templates, and data dictionary changes to 
 recognize code sets for CPT and/or ICD9 codes.  Please refer to the 
 individual patch descriptions to get the names of documentation files.

 The HIPAA regulations mandate that federally recognized code sets used in 
 electronic data interchange (EDI) must accommodate translation for 
 standards development organizations (SDO) established codes according to 
 the date when the code and narrative description were established.  
  
 The data screening of code sets will be modified, to ensure that the code 
 sets are active on the date of treatment or service.  These code sets 
 include:
  
  - ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical 
 Modifications)
  
  - CPT-4 (Clinical Procedure Terminology-4)
  
  
 Individual Patch Description
 ============================ 
 This patch is being released in support of the HIPAA Code Set Versioning 
 (CSV) project.  The CSV project was made necessary by the 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) legislation.  
 The legislation requires code sets to be date sensitive.  Part of the 
 HIPAA requirements specify that (a) the applicable medical data code sets 
 that are valid at the time the health care is furnished is used and (b) 
 that the applicable non-medical data code sets that are valid at the time 
 the transaction is initiated are used.  The CSV project focuses on the 
 versioning of the required code sets and establishing and utilizing a 
 standard set of utilities that will ensure correct content within 
 transactions.

 Blood Bank Team Coordination
 ============================ 
 This patch has been reviewed and cleared.  The changes in preparation for 
 the HIPAA CODE SET VERSIONING (CSV) has no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality. (04/10/2003)
  
  
 Technical Description:
 =====================
 1) To prevent inactive CPT codes from being selected, a screen must be in
    place that uses the correct API to determine if a CPT is inactive for
    a specified date.  
  
    The LAB NLT/CPT CODES file (#64.81), TRANSPORT sub-file (#64.8117) 
    CODE sub-file (#64.811718) CODE field (#.01) (a variable pointer) has
    been modified to use the supported (DBIA1995-A) API function 
    $$CPT^ICPTCOD that checks if a CPT code is active for a particular
    date when selecting an entry from the pointed-to CPT file (#81).  The
    CODE field originally used the logic I '$P(^ICPT(Y,0),U,4) for this
    screen.
