Subject: LOGISTICS DATA QUERY TOOL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Logistics Data Query Tool patch is a blend of IFCAP, Delphi, and 
 Microsoft (MS) Excel technologies.  
  
 After a user invokes the Logistics Data Query Tool by clicking on the 
 PRCLogistics Tool icon on the desktop, enters valid VistA Access and 
 Verify Codes to successfully log into VistA and agrees to obey privacy 
 and confidentially rules, the user will select the beginning and end dates
 for the Purchase Order query and specify any additional, optional fields
 to display.  After the user clicks on the Display button, Purchase Order
 data is presented in a spreadsheet-like format for the user to review.  
 After the header information is displayed in the upper grid, the user can 
 select an individual order and the line item detail for that order will 
 be displayed in a lower grid. The user can export the data to MS Excel by
 clicking on the Excel button.  Data in MS Excel can then be sorted,
 searched or manipulated using the utilities of that application.
  
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
  
 1.  The new routine PRCHL4 extracts Purchase Order header data and 
 optionally line item detail data from IFCAP's Procurement & Accounting 
 Transaction file (#442) and the Prosthetics 1358 file (#664) and loads it 
 into a temporary global for handoff to the Broker to display in the 
 Logistics Data Query Tool  DBIA #4345 authorizes the extraction from file 
 #664.
  
 2.  The new routine PRCHL5 loads into a temporary global the list of 
 optional fields available for extraction and display by the Logistics 
 Data Query Tool.
  
 3.  The new routine PRCHL6 extracts Purchase Order line item detail data 
 from IFCAP's Procurement & Accounting Transactions file (#442) and the 
 Prosthetics 1358 File (#664) and loads it into a RESULTS array for handoff
 to the Broker to display in the Logistics Data Query Tool.  DBIA #4345 
 authorizes the extraction from file #664.

 ============ POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
 These steps are to be performed after the KIDS distribution has been

 1.  Add the VistA menu option PRCHL GUI as a secondary menu option to the 
 VistA user profile for each potential user of this Logistics Data Query 
 Tool.
  
  
 The IRM or the IFCAP Application Coordinator should do the following 
 within VistA:
  
 System Manager Menu (EVE)
         User Management Menu (XUSER)
                 Edit an Existing User (XUSEREDIT)
                         Select NEW PERSON NAME:
                                Select Secondary Menu Options (screen 
                                                           editor option)
                                 Enter PRCHL GUI
                                 Save and Exit
  
 2.  FTP the InstallShield executable, the LDQT User Manual, and the
 Installation guide to a shared drive where users can access them.
  
 3. Once the PRCHL GUI option is assigned to the users, the InstallShield
 executable can be executed on each Windows desktop where the Logistics
 Data Query Tool will be run. To install these, please refer to the
 following steps:
  
  
 If the RPC Broker client is not already installed on the workstation, 
 follow the instructions in chapter 3 Standard Client Workstation 
 Installation Instructions of the RPC Broker Installation Guide version 
 1.1 (revised February 2005), available on the VistA Documentation Library 
 (VDL). In this case the broker server will also have to be defined by 
 executing ServerList.exe, which is described on pages 2-3 to 2-5 of the 
 RPC Broker Systems Manual (revised February 2005), which is also 
 available on the VDL.  Both xwb1_1ws.exe and ServerList.exe, which are 
 mentioned in those manuals, are distributed as part of the Broker.
  
 Once the RPC broker client is configured, to install the Logistics Data 
 Query Tool do the following:
  
 The following files will automatically be installed on the users C: drive 
 in the folder C:\PROGRAM FILES\VISTA\IFCAP  :
  
 INETWH32.dll
 PRCLogisticsTools.cnt
 PRCLogisticsTools.exe
 PRCLogisticsTools.hlp
 ReadMe.txt
 ROBOEX32.DLL
  
 The ReadMe.txt file will contain any changes to the system that were not 
 included in the Installation Guide.
  
   1.  Find the InstallShield executable file and the LDQT installation
       manual on the shared drive.
  
   2.  Double click on the InstallShield executable file
       PRCLogisticsTools_v1.exe and answer the prompts, always accepting
       the default answers.
   3.  Click on "Finish" when the installation is complete.
   4.  Double Click on the new icon on the desktop to verify that 
       the LDQT activates and then log into VistA to confirm connectivity.
   5.  If problems occur, refer to the Installation Manual for 
       instructions or contact IRM.
   6.  The User Manual can either be downloaded to the user's desktop or 
       accessed from the shared directory as local custom dictates.
