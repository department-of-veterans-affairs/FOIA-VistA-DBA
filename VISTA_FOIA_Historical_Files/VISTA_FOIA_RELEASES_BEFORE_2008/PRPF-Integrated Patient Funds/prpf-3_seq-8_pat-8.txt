Description: 
============

  This patch addresses two minor, unrelated problems in the Patient Funds
  package that resulted in the following NOIS:
  
  Overview of NOIS MESSAGES:
  -------------------------
  CLE-1097-42161 - re occasional display of info from Engineering (due to
                   non-initialization of print buffer)
  TOM-1297-41000 - re inclusion of inappropriate (inactive) patients
                   in some Indigent Report
               
  
  The following NOIS are closed. (NOTE:  They were originally flagged for
  this patch).
  
  CIH-0997-40350 - re non-working of Print Range of Cards (thought to be
                   due to extraneous ]) does NOT seem to be valid and has
                   been closed.
  
  COA-0697-22195 - re Overdue Restrictions Search failures  --  fixed by
                                                                patch 7
  PTH-1197-20096 - local keyboarding error
  
  
  There are no E3R messages associated with this patch.
  
  A transaction date that prints a YY value (i.e., 98) in the PRPF
  TRANSACTION DISPLAY print template was expanded to display 4 digits for
  the year (YYYY - i.e, 1998). To accomodate this change, Data Dictionary
  field #9 [DATE ENTERED] within subfile #30 [PATIENT TRANSACTION] of File
  #470 [Patient Funds] is being updated.
  
  In addition, the Sort Template PRPF INDIGENT LIST has been changed, and
  is being distributed with this patch.
  
  
    PATCH INSTALLATION
    ================== 
    If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
    following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
    disabled to prevent possible conflicts.  Other VISTA users will not be
    affected. (Installation while users are on the system will at most
    cause a "Can't return to source" situation however data will NOT be
    affected.)
