Description:
============

 This patch provides several minor enhancements and bug fixes to the HL7
 software.  A description of each change is listed below:
  
 1. The optional "EXCLUDE SUBSCRIBER" subscript has been added to the HLP
    array for application developers to use when calling the
    GENERATE^HLMA API.  Using "EXCLUDE SUBSCRIBER"  allows the application
    to specify subscriber protocols that should be skipped when
    sending an HL7 message.  In effect this allows the application to say
    "use this event protocol, except drop these particular subscribers from the
    event protocols subscriber list".
 
 2. The HLO Application Registry now allows the version of the message to
    be specified.  This allows applications to specify different processing
    routines for different versions of the same message and event type.
  
 3. The HLO Application Registry now provides an activate/inactivate flag so
    that a particular message type for a particular application can be turned
    on and off at will.
 
 4. The HLL input parameter has been EN^HLOCNRT API.  This allows existing
    applications that do not currently use HLO to more easily convert to using
    HLO. The HLL array is used by some applications to dynamically address
    messages by passing in a list of recipients.  Applications that currently
    pass HLL into the old GENERATE^HLMA API may wish to convert to using HLO,
    and this new feature may make conversion easier.  
 
 5. For HLO, the name of the Sending and Receiving Application is not currently
    checked for embedded HL7 delimiters when building messages. This patch fixes
    that deficiency.  If the application name does contain an HL7 delimiter,
    then it will be replaced by the appropriate escape sequence.  
  
 6. The HL7 package allows a READ TIMEOUT and ACK TIMEOUT parameter to
    be specified for each entry in the HL Logical Link file.  This patch
    contains an improvement in how the HL7 client and server software
    use those parameters.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
    2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners running on 
        all nodes in the cluster, for example:
          ISC6A1> TCPIP
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5000CACHE  
  
  
    3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management options listed below:
  
          Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
    4.  Use the STOP HLO action of the HLO System Monitor option to
        temporarily stop the transmission of HLO messages.  
   
    5.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    6.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
        The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
        the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
  
        When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
        patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
        and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*132>
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols?  <NO>
  
    7.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
        the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
        and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
  
        (Note those links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
        to be restarted manually.)
  
    8. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners, for example:
          ISC6A1> TCPIP
          TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5000CACHE 
  
    9. Use the START HLO action of the HLO System Monitor option to 
       resume transmission of HLO messages.
  
   10.  Please verify that the option HLO SYSTEM STARTUP is scheduled
         to run both daily and upon system startup.  If not, please:
 
       a. To ensure that HLO messaging does not get disrupted, the HL7
          developers now recommend that sites use Schedule/Unschedule
          Options for HLO SYSTEM STARTUP:
  
            - Run the HLO SYSTEM STARTUP option daily, the specific time of day
              does not matter.
  
           - Make sure it runs on startup (i.e., SPECIAL QUEUEING: STARTUP) 
 
    b.  To ensure that HLO is currently running please do the following:
 
         Using the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR option verify:
            SYSTEM STATUS:             RUNNING
            PROCESS MANAGER:           RUNNING
