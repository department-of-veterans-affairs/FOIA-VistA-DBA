Subject: PENDING C&P EXAMS REPORT SORT AND %DT(0) LEAKAGE PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch resolves issues when sorting by routing location on the
 Pending C&P Exams Report [DVBA C PENDING REPORT] and with the potential
 leakage of the %DT(0) variable.

 2. ISF-1100-60362       A 'Heads Up' Input Transform and Leakage of %DT (0)

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. CPH-1100-41712       PENDING C&P REPORT DIVISION SELECT PRB
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Pending C&P Exams Report [DVBA C PENDING REPORT] option
    from the Regional Office Reports Menu [DVBA C REGIONAL OFF RPT MENU],
    users are unable to sort by routing location unless the entry made is
    the Medical Center Division's internal entry number (IEN).  Users
    should be able to make selections by Medical Center Division name,
    facility number, and treating specialty as well.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^DVBCPNDR has been modified to allow the selection of a routing
    location by Medical Center Division IEN, name, facility number, and
    by treating specialty.
  
 2. ISF-1100-60362       A 'Heads Up' Input Transform and Leakage of %DT (0)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Two input transforms were identified as not killing the variable %DT(0)
    after returning from routine ^%DT.  This introduced a possible leakage
    of the variable which could cause problems.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The variable %DT will be killed in the input transforms for the
    following:
  
       File                       Field
       ----                       -----
       2507 REQUEST (#396.3)      APPROVAL DATE/TIME (#26)
       2507 EXAM (#396.4)         DATE OF EXAM (#.06)
