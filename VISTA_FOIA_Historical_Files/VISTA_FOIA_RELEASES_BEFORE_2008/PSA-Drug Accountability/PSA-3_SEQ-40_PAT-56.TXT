Subject: DUPLICATE DRUG FILE SYNONYMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. HD68257: Drug SYNONYM (#9) field duplicates are being created in
 the DRUG (#50) file. The process of verifying an invoice that is adding a
 new drug synonym to the DRUG (#50) file was found to be adding duplicates
 on the same invoice and between invoices that were processed at the same
 time. The verification process now insures duplicates are not being 
 created.
   
 2. HD128777: Pharmacy locations, in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS (#58.8)
 file, may have their associated entries in the DRUG (#50) file updated by
 zero quantity invoice items if the location is not marked for tracking
 inventory or re-order levels.
  
 NOTE: A post init will review the Drug file (#50) and remove all but the 
 first of identical synonym duplicates from under a drug. A "PSA*3*56 
 Delete Duplicate Drug Synonyms report" mailman message will be sent to 
 the person who performs the installation identifying what drug-synonyms 
 had identical synonyms deleted. It will also indicate if there were none 
 found to be removed.
  
 EXAMPLE 1)      Duplicate synonyms found and were deleted.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. 68257 Duplicate drug synonyms are being created in the DRUG (#50) file.
      
 Problem:
 ======== 
 The process of verifying an invoice that is adding a new drug SYNONYM (#9)
 file to the DRUG (#50) file was found to be adding duplicates in the same
 invoice and between invoices that were processed at the same time. The 
 verification process now insures duplicates are not being created.
      
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 PSAVER7 has been modified to check and match to the first possible VSN/
 NDC (Volume Serial Number/National Center for Documentation) synonym
 each time it is being instructed to add a new SYNONYM (#9) field to the
 DRUG (#50) file.
      
 Technical:
 ==========
 PSAVER7 is checking giving VSN matching more priority that NDC matching 
 Mckesson has stated that its uses VSNs as the unique identifying factor in 
 its inventory while NDCs may be changing on the items within the inventory.
  
 2. HD128777: Pharmacy locations, in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS 
 (#58.8) file, may have their associated entries in the DRUG (#50) file
 updated by zero quantity invoice items if the location is not marked for
 tracking inventory or re-order levels.
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 Invoice items assigned to pharmacy locations that are not tracking 
 inventory or re-order levels are having their data in the DRUG (#50) file 
 updated by zero quantity items.
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 PSAVER7 has been modified to check and block all zero quantity items from 
 updating the DRUG (#50) file values.
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 PSAVER7 is checking the variables PSAQTY and PSADUREC and if either is 
 zero the edits to the DRUG (#50) file are blocked.
