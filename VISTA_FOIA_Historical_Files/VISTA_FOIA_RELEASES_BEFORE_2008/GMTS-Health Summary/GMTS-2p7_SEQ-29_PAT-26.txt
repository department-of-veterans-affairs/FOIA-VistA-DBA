  INSTALLATION:
  =============
   
  This patch can be installed with users on the system.  Installation
  will take less than two minutes.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2.  If this is the initial installation of this patch, skip this step
      (all routines are new).  If this is not the initial installation 
      of this patch (i.e., re-install patch in same account) then you 
      will need to review your mapped set to see if any of the routines
      listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped.  If found, they
      should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  On the KIDS menu, under the INSTALLATION menu, use the
      following options: (when prompted for INSTALL NAME 
      enter GMTS*2.7*26)
 
        Print Transport Global                        optional
        Compare Transport Global to Current System    optional/recommended
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global          optional/recommended
        Backup a Transport Global                     optional/recommended
        Install Package(s)                            required for install
  
  4.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
      Menu Options, and Protocols? YES//", respond "NO".
  
  5.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they
      should be returned to the mapped set once the installation
      has run to completion.
  
  6.  If the account in which this KIDS install is executed has the Image
      global defined (^MAG(2005,0)) than the component will be enabled
      in the initialization routine (GMTSP26).  It is otherwise installed
      as disabled.
  
  7.  Delete the routine GMTSP26.
