Description:
============

 This patch distributes a new option: Encounters Transmitted with MT Status
 of U [SCRPW TRANS MT EQUAL U RPT]
  
 The report included in this patch is the follow up to Patch SD*5.3*296,
 which was a KIDS build released on May 29, 2003.  That patch addressed
 changes requested in an Executive Decision Memo sponsored by the VHA Chief
 Business Office (CBO) regarding Veteran Financial Assessments.  The CBO
 requested the removal of the restriction that blocked transmission of
 outpatient encounters (ACRP) and inpatient episodes of care (PTF) to the
 National Patient Care Database (NPCD) if a veteran's updated financial
 assessment (Means Test) information was not complete (Means Test status
 equals Required or U).
  
 Due to the changes brought in by patch SD*5.3*296, reports are needed to
 identify patients who require a Means Test and who have had encounters /
 inpatient episodes of care transmitted with a MT indicator of U.  This
 patch provides the outpatient-based report; patch DG*5.3*537 will provide
 the inpatient / PTF-based report.
  
 The new report option is called Encounters Transmitted with MT Status of U
 [SCRPW TRANS MT EQUAL U RPT]. It will be added to the Incomplete Encounter
 Reports [SCENI IEMM REPORTS MENU] menu when this patch is installed.
 This report conforms to requirements related to the VERA allocation
 process, where at least one encounter within the Fiscal Year must include
 a valid Means Test status for the patient.  The patient will be included
 on the report only if ALL of the patient's encounters within the date
 range selected have a means test indicator at encounter Transmission equal
 to 'U'.  This will focus the list on patients who have no valid MT status
 in the National Patient Care Database (NPCD) for the date range chosen.  
 The report may be printed by Previous Fiscal Year, Current Fiscal Year, or
 User Specified Date Range.  The current FY is the suggested date range for
 this report.
  
 This report will print the patient's name, Last Four of the patient's 
 social security number, Outpatient Encounter Date, Means Test Indicator,
 Medical Center Division, and Clinic the encounter occurred in.  The
 encounter date will be flagged with an "*" if the encounter record has
 been transmitted.  This report is sorted alphabetically by patient name.  
 Note, this report is formatted to print on a 132 column device and will 
 not display correctly to the terminal screen or 80 column printer.
  
 Running this report will generate a new mailman message to the user 
 initiating the report.  This message will provide summary information, 
 showing start and end times for the report run, total time it took the
 report to process, how many records were scanned, how many were included
 in the report and a patient count.

 Note: It's recommended that this report be run during non-peak hours.
 Sample times from the test sites indicate that for an average of 700,000
 Outpatient Records scanned, the tasked report will take approximately
 1 hour and 40 minutes to run.  You may also see a small percentage of 
 records reported as having a means test indicator of 'U' which may be the 
 result of other eligibility issues  with the encounter record.  This 
 report is intended as an aid to help in tracking down these problems.
