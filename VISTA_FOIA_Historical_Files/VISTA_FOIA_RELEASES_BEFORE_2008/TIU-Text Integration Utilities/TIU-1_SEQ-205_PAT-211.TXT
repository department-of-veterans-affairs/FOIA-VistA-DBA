Description:
============

 This patch introduces the VHA Enterprise Document Type Ontology and 
 a mapping utility to assist CACs with the process of mapping Local TIU
 Titles (from the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1)) to VHA Enterprise
 Standard Titles (from the TIU VHA ENTERPRISE STANDARD TITLE file #8926.1).
 It also assures that the dialogs for editing TIU Document Definitions will
 prompt for the mapping, and that all views of TIU Documents (e.g., Browse
 & Detailed Display) as well as any printed formats, will include the VHA
 Enterprise Standard Title in addition to the Local TIU Title.
  
 The standardized files that are being introduced by patch TIU*1*211 
 include:
  
 8926.1      TIU VHA ENTERPRISE STANDARD TITLE
 8926.2      TIU LOINC SUBJECT MATTER DOMAIN
 8926.3      TIU LOINC ROLE
 8926.4      TIU LOINC SETTING
 8926.5      TIU LOINC SERVICE
 8926.6      TIU LOINC DOCUMENT TYPE
  
 In addition, the TIU STATUS file (#8925.6) will be standardized per VHA
 Directive 2005-044. 
  
 Under this directive, all of the files included in the patch will be
 "locked down" by Data Standardization (DS). Local modification of the file
 definitions (i.e. data dictionaries) shall not be allowed. All additions,
 changes and deletions to entries in the files shall be done by Enterprise
 Reference Terminology (ERT) using the Master File Server (MFS), provided 
 by Common Services (CS). Creating and/or editing locally defined fields in
 the files shall not be permitted. Use of locally defined fields that were
 created prior to VHA Directive 2005-044 shall not be supported.
  
 Once the TIU*1*211 patch has been installed, the Post-install routine 
 calls an Application Program Interface (API) in the Health Data
 Informatics (HDI) package which creates an XML file for each of the files
 being standardized. The XML file includes the Term/Concept (.01 Field) for
 each entry from each of the files. Each XML file is then forwarded to the
 central server (FORUM).  On the FORUM server, each XML file is compared
 with the standardized data from Enterprise Terminology Services (ETS), and
 FORUM sets a VHA Unique Identifier (VUID) value for every entry. In the
 case of the TIU STATUS File, the typical protocol for standardizing a
 pre-existing VistA file will be observed. i.e., The data received from the
 facility is modified as follows: (1) FORUM sets a VHA Unique Identifier
 (VUID) value for every matching entry; (2) local entries are assigned a
 VUID from a block of available numbers, and identified as inactive terms;
 and (3) duplicate entries are identified as inactive terms. However, given
 the nature and usage of this file, we aren't expecting to encounter any
 local additions or modifications. 
  
 Since the other standard files for this application are all being 
 introduced with this patch, are locked-down from their inception, and are
 identical at all facilities, the resolution of local and duplicate terms
 described above is unnecessary. The XML File, with the terms and their
 corresponding VUIDs, is then passed back to the facility. The HDI package
 on the Facility Server will use the XML file to update the corresponding
 VistA files.
  
 Once the Facility's VistA files have been updated, a MailMan mail message
 is automatically sent to the Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) team.
 The ERT team will manually initiate a Master File Server (MFS) push 
 through the Vitria Interface Engine (VIE), which will complete the update
 with standardized data.  This ERT update relies on VUIDs as a key for
 inserting the standardized data.  At this point, the facility is
 considered standardized for that particular VistA file.
  
 Once the Facility's VistA files are standardized, the Health Data 
 Repository (HDR) Implementation managers are notified automatically via
 another MailMan message.
  
 The complementary Health Summary patch (GMTS*2.7*81), which is described
 separately, and assures that the VHA Enterprise Standard Titles of TIU
 Documents will be displayed, along with their Local Titles, in the HS
 Components for Progress Notes and Discharge Summaries, will be installed
 along with the current patch, and is included in the same KIDS 
 distribution.
