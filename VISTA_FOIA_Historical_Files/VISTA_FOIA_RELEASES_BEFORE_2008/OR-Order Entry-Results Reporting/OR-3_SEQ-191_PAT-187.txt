Description:
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION
 =================
  
 Patch 187 / GUI 23 implements Inpatient Medications for Outpatients,
 Geriatric Extended Care, and Patient Record Flags, and Women's Health.
  
 -- INPATIENT MEDICATION ORDERS FOR OUTPATIENTS (IMO)
  
 - In an authorized hospital location providers can now place inpatient 
 medication orders (unit dose orders) on an outpatient.  The new orders 
 will be saved as inpatient unit dose orders and processed by inpatient 
 pharmacy.  This CPRS function will remain dormant until installation of 
 patches SD*5.3*285 and PSJ*5.0*111.
  
 -- NOTES TAB
  
 - Double-clicking the "New Note" button, or clicking more than once 
 before the visit or title selection screens appeared, could sometimes 
 result in the problems of multiple notes being edited simultaneously and 
 signed blank notes.  These have been corrected by disabling (graying out) 
 the "New Notes" button after the user's initial click.  Subsequent clicks 
 are ignored until the button is re-enabled normally by other actions.
  
 --NOTES/CONSULTS
  
 - On the Notes tab, when beginning a new note, the "unresolved consults" 
 reminder screen was not always being displayed if "Verify Note Titles"  
 was set to FALSE and/or if the user had a default non-consults title.  
 This has been fixed.
  
 -- TEMPLATES, TEMPLATE DIALOGS
  
 - NOIS: DUR-0903-30815, PUG-0104-51275, NOP-1003-11865 - Hyperlink 
 template fields were fixed to activate the link when it was clicked.  
 Hyperlinks at the element level are fixed in this version. Hyperlinks at
 the group level will be fixed in v24.
  
 - Reworked code that was introduced in GUI 21 which caused a significant 
 degradation in template dialog performance.
  
 - If CPRS attempts to timeout while a template dialog is open, the 
 warning message about loss of changes should NOT appear, since it 
 requires a response. This prevents CPRS from shutting down, leaving 
 patient information visible on the screen.  This was discovered in 
 testing and has been corrected.
  
 -- CLINICAL REMINDERS
  
 - The GEC project consists of four Reminder Dialogs that must be filled
 out to be consider a complete referral. New functionality in this release
 will evaluate the dialogs and display a message stating which dialogs are 
 not completed for a referral. This functionality will not be seen until 
 PXRM*2.0*2 is released.
  
 - A problem was discovered with some reminders reporting that the 
 user does not have an active Person Class.  This caused the reminder 
 dialog to go into an infinite loop requiring a kill of CPRS through 
 Window Task Manager.  The problem was only manifested when trying to 
 evaluate reminders for an addendum.  This behavior was caused by the 
 parent note having a bad Episode Begin Date.  In GUI 23, if the 
 reminder receives a bad encounter date from the progress note the 
 user will be prompted with a warning message advising them to contact 
 IRM to fix the parent Episode Begin Date.  The user will not be able 
 to process the reminder since it will not know what encounter date 
 to use for storage of the encounter data.
  
 - A problem with the PCE Primary Diagnosis designation being incorrectly
 assigned (or not assigned at all) when processing reminders was
 corrected.
  
 - Reminder dialogs were updated to save the window size/position between 
 dialogs/CPRS sessions.
  
 -- PATIENT RECORD FLAGS
  
 -  NOIS: PUG-0903-52299 - When a user selected the same PRF patient 
 several times in a single CPRS session, a MUMPS error was generated and 
 sometimes the user could see the duplicated patient record flag.  This 
 has been fixed.
  
 -- WINDOWS MESSAGING
  
 - NOIS: ANN-0102-42499, POR-0302-51449, NJH-0402-20654, HUN-0602-21532, 
 SFC-1202-61344, HWH-0203-41237, AMA-0403-71729, SLC-0603-51011, 
 ECH-0603-51641 - Many sites have reported that CPRS sometimes hangs 
 between the time of logon and the time the patient selection screen 
 appears.  The user's only recourse is to kill CPRS and try again.  This 
 is caused by misbehavior of low-level Windows messaging occurring between 
 CPRS and other desktop applications.  A fix for this issue has undergone 
 preliminary testing by both CPRS and VistA Imaging developers, but needs 
 to be tested thoroughly in this release.  First, sites running VistA 
 Imaging in conjunction with CPRS should insure that no loss of 
 functionality has occurred as a result of this change.  And CPRS and 
 Imaging should continue to remain synchronized as always when Imaging is 
 started via the CPRS Tools menu.  Second, sites experiencing the aptly 
 named "gray screen of death" should determine whether this fix provides a 
 solution to that problem. 
  
 - A previous fix to the "grey screen of death" issue that was included in 
 earlier test versions now also includes a performance enhancement (also 
 originally slated for GUI V24).  WE REALLY NEED SOME VISTA IMAGING SITES 
 TO THOROUGHLY TEST PATIENT AND DOCUMENT SYNCHRONIZATION WITH CPRS TO 
 ENSURE THAT THIS STILL FUNCTIONS AS IT HAS PREVIOUSLY WHEN STARTING 
 IMAGING FROM THE CPRS TOOLS MENU.
  
 -- PROVIDER/USER SELECTION
  
 The following E3R's and NOIS relate to Provider/User display and 
 selection when duplicate names exist: 
  
     E3R's - 14259
             15178
             15847
             17043
             17555
             17743
  
     NOIS - ATG-0701-32085
            HAM-1100-20360
            PUG-1001-52064
            FAV-0803-70870
            BRX-1003-11098
            LEX-0302-40449
  
 The above all reported various versions of a desire to eliminate RDV
 Remote Data Views) users from provider/user selection lists, and 
 difficulty with identifying the correct provider or user when selecting 
 same for an Encounter, as signer/co-signer of a Note, and similar 
 situations in the GUI.  As a result, the GUI has been updated so that 
 the following occurs:
  
     1 - When names are displayed, the user's Title is included (if any).  
  
     2 - When more than one user exists with the same first and last names,
         the following results:
  
         A - When names are displayed, the Service/Section is also shown.
  
         B - When names are displayed, the Division is also shown, 
             depending on whether the application can determine a 
             valid division entry to display (see item C, next).
  
         C - Division data display follows these rules:
  
             i - No division is displayed if not a multi-divisional site.
            ii - If multi-divisional and no division listed, no division 
                 is displayed.
           iii - If only one division is listed, it is also displayed.  
            iv - If more than one division is listed and one is marked 
                 as "Default" then it is displayed.
             v - If more than one division is listed and none is marked 
                 "Default" then no Division information is displayed. 
  
     3 - Users who are "VISITORS" in the NEW PERSON file as a result of 
         entries created there in connection with RDV (Remote Data Views)
         are screened from the selection lists.  
  
     4 - Terminated users are screened from the selection lists.
  
 -- ENCOUNTERS, VISIT SELECTION
  
 - A circumstance was discovered where the encounter date/time being 
 passed to TIU on document creation was "-1".  The validation logic in the 
 Visit Selection screen has been tightened to prevent this from 
 happening.  Additionally, if this should occur when beginning a new 
 document or entering a new order for a patient, the user will be asked to 
 re-select a visit as if none currently exists.  This will ensure that the 
 correct visit information is filed with these items.
  
 - When selecting a visit location for a new visit for an outpatient, 
 hospital locations of type "WARD" will no longer be included in the 
 list.  Selection of these locations was causing a variety of problems 
 downstream, and was not consistent with List Manager selection options.  
 Selection of existing visits and existing admissions remains unchanged.
  
 -- ORDERS
  
 - NOIS: LEX-0302-40065, FGH-0202-32201 - When a patient has been checked 
 into an outpatient location, such as ER, a clinician can order certain 
 inpatient medications (injectables for IV's).  If a clinician is writing 
 orders on a patient and the patient is admitted by an appropriate person 
 during that same time frame, the ordering location is not changed until 
 the clinician signs the orders (a pop-up box actually appears and tells 
 the clinician that there is now a new patient location and should the 
 orders to print to it?).  If this scenario occurs, the medication shows 
 as an inpatient med on the meds tab but as an outpatient med on the 
 orders tab.  This has been fixed.  The medication will now show as an 
 inpatient med on both the Meds and Orders tabs.
  
 - NOIS: SUX-0103-42340 - CPRS users with no OR or PROVIDER keys are 
 unable to sign a new note when using the File | Review/Sign Changes 
 option. A change in this version will allow no-key users to sign the 
 selected notes. 
  
 - NOIS: BEC-0103-22364 - For an IV quick order with VERIFY and 
 AUTO-ACCEPT set to YES, on the verify window the provider comment did not 
 display because of the length limitation of 40 characters.  This has been 
 fixed.
  
 - NOIS: HIN-0503-41731 - If a nurse DC'd an order, made it "Hold until 
 Signed" and then left CPRS, and a pharmacist meanwhile finished the 
 original order via the backdoor with a service correction change, when 
 the nurse returned to CPRS and tried to release the DC'd order to 
 service, a confusing message appeared without indicating that the order 
 had already been finished and activated by pharmacy.  This has been 
 remedied.
  
 - NOIS: MAN-0403-12285 - For an outpatient, when copying previously DC'd 
 inpatient medication orders for immediately release, the new orders show 
 as inpatient med orders on the Meds Tab and as outpatient med orders on 
 the Orders tab.  This has been fixed.  Such orders will now show as 
 outpatient med orders on both tabs. 
  
 - NOIS: AMA-0403-71198 - For a CPRS user lacking authorization to write 
 medication orders, when the user selected med orders for copy/transfer 
 for a delayed event on the Meds Tab, after creating the event default 
 order the Copy/Transfer process was terminated because the user was not 
 authorized to write med orders and the previously created event default 
 order got canceled automatically.  This has been fixed. 
  
 - NOIS WPB-0798-30276: In this version, CPRS allows user to change the 
 refills and pickup for an unreleased unsigned renewal order.
  
 - NOIS HIN-0803-41027: For a discharge event, when copying an inpatient 
 medication order to an outpatient medication order, the order dialog 
 presented was the inpatient medication order dialog instead of the 
 outpatient dialog.  This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: HEH-1103-40959 - The PREGNANT box in the radiology order dialog 
 box was not a mandatory check box for female patients and that could 
 potentially cause a patient safety issue.  This has been updated.  For a 
 female patient the check for pregnancy field MUST be entered before a 
 radiology order will be accepted. 
  
 - NOIS: DUR-1003-31180 - For an event delayed order, if a quick order is 
 created with "verify" yes and "auto accept" no, the order dialog window 
 will not display.  Instead there is now a "verify" window displayed with 
 accept, edit or cancel choices.  Additionally, even if quick order did 
 not have a dosage predefined it could still be placed with no dosage.  
 This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS STX-0203-70826; MAC-1103-61285; UNY-1003-11396
 LR LAB COLLECT FUTURE no longer working in GUI, but does in Listman.
 NOIS reports that this stopped working in v20.  It now works again.
  
 - NOIS: TUA-0104-31320 - When changing an unsigned, unreleased inpatient 
 renewed medication order, the new order did not get updated correctly on 
 the MEDS tab.  This has been fixed.  CPRS now does not allow users to 
 change unreleased or pending renewal inpatient medication orders.
  
 - NOIS: MAD-0903-41330 - Upon selecting outpatient pharmacy orders from 
 the "copy active orders for selected event" for a delayed admission, the 
 orders will now present the ordering dialog.  The user must then enter a 
 medication route before the order will be accepted.
  
 -- MEDS ORDERS
  
 - User sizing of the medication order dialog was not honored cross 
 sessions. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS: CHA-0603-31953, BAY-0903-30560 - Due to allocation errors 
 reported by sites the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS date range function for 
 displaying active medication orders on Meds tab was disabled.  
 This functionality will be returned in a subsequent release.
  
 -- 508 ISSUES
  
 - The new JAWS scripts allow the auto-completion features of combo boxes 
 throughout CPRS to work without interfering with how JAWS speaks.
  
 - The new JAWS scripts now let JAWS read the title for the Vitals listbox 
 on the cover sheet.
  
 - In an inadvertent change to version 22, the Problem Editor screen 
 stopped filling up available room in the problem tab.  This has 
 been fixed.
  
 - New JAWS scripts fix several control labels that were either 
 mispronounced or not spoken: Proc and Consult Orders now speak 
 Provisional Diagnosis and Reason for Request correctly.  The
 Allergies box in Patient Postings dialog was fixed.
  
 - JAWS text for the reminders button on the main toolbar now reflects 
 the icon or animation that is displayed there.
  
 - Several edit fields were adding tab characters to text when <Shift-Tab> 
 or <Ctrl-Tab> were used to navigate out of them.  This has been fixed 
 in the following: Proc and Consult Orders, Proc and Consult Editors, 
 Template Editor.
  
 - Graphics have been labeled in JAWS for the Notes and Consult tree 
 views, the Template Editor dialog, and the info box in order dialogs.
  
 - JAWS now speaks the value of the Then/And pop-up button on the 
 complex orders screen, rather than the less-useful title.
  
 -The Refill dialog was having sizing problems with large fonts, and 
 also was not canceling out of form when <Esc> was pressed.  These 
 problems have been fixed.
  
 - In the Orders dialog, with font sizes 10 or greater, the OK or Cancel
 buttons were invisible in the order renewal dialog box.  This has been
 fixed.
  
 -- CLINICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (CCOW)
  
 - If a user had preferences set to use the last tab on a change of 
 patient, this preference was not always being respected, especially on a 
 patient change induced via CCOW in another application.  This has been 
 corrected.
  
 -- PATIENT SELECTION
  
 -The selection of patients based on appointments at one or more clinics, 
 has been modified to utilize new replacement Scheduling API's to allow 
 for smooth changeover when scheduling data moves to COTS software and 
 data storage.  This change is behind-the-scenes; there should be small 
 visible change to users, with the exception that hovering the mouse over 
 a patient name will display the full line, at the end of which the user 
 will see one of three entries indicative of the status of the patient 
 involved:
  
    - Ipt              Inpatient
    - Opt              Outpatient
    - < blank >        < not determinable >
  
 - When patients were selected from a clinic, whether set as the "Default" 
 for patient selection or not, the Encounter data was not holding when 
 different patients were selected.  This was fixed.  An unreported but 
 similar problem where the Encounter data was not updated when the same 
 patient was on a list (such as appointments in two different clinics), 
 and then selected twice, was also fixed.  
  
 - E3Rs: #17825, #18461 - When two patients with the same names and last 4 
 digits of the SSN are selected a dialogue box appears and requires the 
 user to select the correct patient from the list.  The original labeling 
 of this dialogue box was "Duplicate Patients" and the label was 
 subsequently changed to read "Similar Patients" instead, per the second 
 E3R listed.  
  
 - When a Clinic was set as the default source for patient selection and a 
 patient was selected by means of the "Last5" functionality - i.e., by 
 entering the last 4 digits of the SSN or an initial with the last 4 SSN 
 digits - the encounter information was not refreshing on the encounter 
 panel across the top of the cover sheet with the inpatient data (as it 
 used to do).  This has been fixed.  Note that other changes in this patch 
 now re-set the encounter panel data whenever a patient is selected even 
 if the patient is on the list more than once or twice: a patient might be 
 on the list with one or more appointments, on the list in a Ward as well 
 in a "combination" list that shows clinics and that ward, and then also 
 as a patient in the bottom part of the box where "all" patients are 
 shown.  With the new functionality, the patient's encounter data is 
 updated from wherever his or her name might be selected on that list, so 
 that if selected from the clinic listing the clinic visit information 
 should populate, if from a ward, the inpatient data should populate 
 (unless the patient is not an inpatient, in which case the common "Visit 
 not selected" message will appear), and so forth.  
  
 - From the Pt. Selection screen, when a user selected a Clinic and then 
 used the "Save Patient List Settings" to make that Clinic the Default 
 Patient Selection setting - and if the user then selected a patient which 
 was NOT listed for that default clinic, then the information for that 
 default clinic that was just set would appear anyway as the Encounter 
 location.  This bug should now be fixed.  
  
 -- COVER SHEET, ENCOUNTER PANEL
  
 - Encounter locations weren't being kept when a Clinic was the default 
 patient selection source.  This has been fixed.  
  
 -- PROBLEMS TAB
  
 - NOIS: WAS-1003-20405 - If editing a problem shown as having an inactive 
 code, and selecting a problem via the Lexicon lookup with the same text 
 but a new code, it was impossible to save this change since the new 
 problem was seen as a duplicate of the old.  This has been corrected. 
  
 - NOIS: WAS-1003-20405 - There was a defect when changing a Problem List 
 problem with a currently-inactive code to one resulting in a code of 
 799.9.  This was scheduled for update in GUI V24 but has instead been 
 added to this release.
  
 -- RPL (RESTRICTED PATIENT LIST - "READ ONLY")
  
 - The "Patient Panel" has been re-activated.  "Read Only" users may now
 click on the panel and it will function.
  
 -- CONSULTS/PROCEDURES ORDERING (CSV)
  
 - NOIS: HUN-1003-21015 - If a free-text provisional diagnosis were 
 included in a quick order, then when trying to place that quick order, 
 this diagnosis would be flagged as having an inactive ICD code, despite 
 there being no code involved.  This has been corrected. 
  
 -- TIU
  
 - Additional Boolean logic was added to the TIU Object Refresh button. 
 This new logic should decrease the number of calls to the RPC "TIU GET 
 LIST OF OBJECTS".
  
 -- OPTIONS
  
 - Under the "Patient Selection Defaults" menu and selecting clinics for 
 the days of the week, if the selection list exceeded 44 in number, a 
 previously-selected clinic over 44 names down the list would not appear.  
 This has been fixed.  
  
 --LABS
  
 - NOIS: STX-0203-70826, MAC-1103-61285, UNY-1003-11396 - The LR LAB 
 COLLECT FUTURE quit working, evidently beginning with GUI 20.  This has 
 been fixed.  
  
 --DOCUMENTATION
  
 - NOIS: BHS-1203-11247 - The "FAQ" section of CPRS GUI "Help" pointed to 
 the wrong location.  This has been fixed.

 The software includes logic that will avoid calling PXRMGECU and 
 WH^PXRMRPCC until Clinical Reminders version 2.0 is installed at the 
 site; it avoids calling routines WVALERTF and WVRPCNO1 until patch
 WV*1*16 is installed at the site; and it avoids calling routine SDAMA203
 until patch SD*5.3*285 is installed at the site.

 *(This file contains, in the CPRS-Chart folder, a "README.TXT" file 
   of major importance to sites utilizing the Delphi source code.)
  
 The "JAWS_Scripts_xxxVxx.ZIP" file contains configuration files that
 replace the file in "informational" patch OR*3.0*126.  These configuration
 files will need to be copied to the <JAWS>\SETTINGS\ENU\ file on all
 workstations using JAWS.  JAWS power users will likely want to install 
 and customize these files themselves.  
  
 The files listed above may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method is 
 to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================= 
  
 Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.  
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to 
 minimize disruption.  Installation will take approximately 
 5 minutes or more, depending on the menu structure at your site.
  
 1.  Obtain the file OR_30_187.KID.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
 4.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_187.KID when prompted to Enter
     a Host File name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
  
 5.  If given the option to run any Environment Check Routine(s), answer 
     "YES."
  
 6.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*187):
        a.  Backup a Transport Global
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
  
 7.  When ready, select the Install Packages option (when prompted for 
     the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*187).
  
 8.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? Yes//", respond "YES."
  
 9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
     YES//', respond "YES." 
  
 10. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
     options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
        OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN          CPRS Clinician Menu
        OR OE/RR MENU NURSE              CPRS Nurse Menu
        OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK         CPRS Ward Clerk Menu
        OR CPRS GUI CHART
  
 11. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0.'
  
 12. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
     completion.
  
 13. Following successful installation, the pre/post-install routine 
     ORY187 may be deleted.
  
 14. Retrieve and open the file OR_30_187.ZIP.
  
 15. Place the User and Technical Manual files in a location that can 
     be accessed by CPRS users.
  
 16. Move the CPRSChart.exe and help files to the appropriate directory 
     where they can be accessed by all CPRS workstations.
  
 17. Provide the JAWS support script files to JAWS users.
