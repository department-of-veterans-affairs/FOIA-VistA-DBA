Description:
============

 ******************************* N O T E **********************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
 problems.
 **************************************************************************
  
 1. This patch updates the Surgery Risk Assessment software of the VISTA 
    Surgery V. 3.0 application as requested by the National Surgical
    Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Executive Committee to bring the
    VA's NSQIP module more in line with the data collected in the private
    sector. This patch also include updates to the Continuous Improvement
    in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP) module. 
    
    Modifications to the Surgery V. 3.0 software include:
    - the addition of 22 new fields to SURGERY file (#130)
    - the update of approximately 120 field descriptions for NSQIP and 
      CICSP data elements in the SURGERY file (#130)
    - the update of data input screens to allow the input of additional
      data elements as well as to delete some data elements no longer 
      needed
    - the addition of two new data input options, Laboratory Test Results 
      (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC] and Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) 
      [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES], on the Cardiac Risk Assessment Information 
      (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC ENTER/EDIT] menu
    - the removal of the option Update Operations as Unrelated/Related to 
      Death [SRO DEATH RELATED] from Surgery Risk Assessment Menu [SROA
      RISK ASSESSMENT]
    - the update of assessment transmissions to reflect the current 
      set of NSQIP and CICSP data elements
    - the update of occurrence categories in the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE
      CATEGORY file (#136.5)
  
 2. This patch will enhance the lookup by case/assessment number feature
    introduced in patch SR*3*121. Within the Surgery Risk Assessment Menu 
    [SROA RISK ASSESSMENT] option, at the "Select Patient" prompt, lookup
    by case/assessment number is allowed by entering the case number
    preceded by #, e.g., enter #6785 to go to case #6785.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval:
 =====================================  
 Sites will retrieve VISTA software and documentation from the following 
 FTP addresses. The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first 
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly 
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity with
 Surgery users off the system. Installation takes less than two minutes. 
 Installation of this patch should NOT be queued.
  
  1. Download the KIDS file, SR_3_P125.KID, from one of the OI Field Office
     anonymous directories.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines in this patch are 
     mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set before continuing.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
  
  4. Use the Load a Distribution option to load the distribution from the
     distribution file downloaded in step 1.
  
  5. From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following 
     options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*125):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global option - This option creates a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
         backup any other changes, such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or
         templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System option - This option 
         allows you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (for
         example, routines, DDs, templates, and more).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global option - This option ensures 
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
         
     (d) Print Transport Global option - This option allows you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*125.
  
  7. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//", respond YES.
  
  8. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//",
     respond NO.
  
  9. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
  
 10. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
     completion.
  
 11. IMPORTANT: Use the edit option of VA FileMan to enter the appropriate
     data name(s) for INR in the LABORATORY DATA NAME field (#1) of the
     RISK MODEL LAB TEST file (#139.2). If appropriate data name(s) do not
     exist, leave blank.
  
 Note: The pre-installation process calls PRE^SR125UTL to perform the
       following tasks:
       - Deletes the data from the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file 
         (#136.5) and resets the zero node to prepare the file for the
         installation updates.
       - Adds INR to the RISK MODEL LAB TEST file (#139.2).
     
       The routine SR125UTL is deleted by the install process.
