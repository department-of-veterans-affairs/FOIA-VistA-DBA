Subject: Deletion of Legacy Domains in File# 537025

Category: 
  - Informational

Description: 
============

  
    Some sites have been mistakenly sending NHE requests to legacy
    sites.  MailMan patches XM*DBA*127 (7/8/99) and XM*DBA*137
    (5/2/00) closed the legacy sites and thus the legacy sites no
    longer receive mail. The legacy sites therefore do not respond to
    the NHE requests.
  
    1. All sites must send NHE requests to primary sites only.
  
    2. All sites must delete legacy sites from their NHE Authorized
    Site File #537025.
  
    This patch lists the legacy domains and the procedure to be used
    to delete legacy domains in the NHE Authorized Site File
    (537025).  This patch is for Medical Centers only.  Database
    sites such as Austin, HEC, FMS, etc. should disregard this patch.
  
  
  Background:
  When two or more VA Medical Center facilities integrate their
  databases, the legacy facilities become DIVISIONS of the primary
  facility.  The "new" facility's station number is the primary
  facility's "old" station number. New station numbers are NOT
  assigned/issued.  Because of the integration, the legacy facilities
  no longer receive mail or Network Health Exchange transmissions from
  other facilities.  All transmissions are received on the primary
  facility.
   
  
  General:
  This patch lists Legacy Domains and the procedure to be used to
  delete their domains in the Network Health Exchange Authorized Site
  File #537025.
   
  Once these domains have been deleted, any Network Health Exchange
  requests must be sent to the primary facility.
   
  
  
  Instructions:
  ------------
  Use your Network Health Exchange Menu to delete the legacy domains:

  If you are an integrated station, the primary facility should not
  close the domains of its legacy facilities. The left column shows the
  domain to close.  If your site's domain is the primary domain (shown
  in the right column) for that legacy domain, do not close the legacy
  domain.
  
  
   
  Using the example, close the following Legacy domains:
