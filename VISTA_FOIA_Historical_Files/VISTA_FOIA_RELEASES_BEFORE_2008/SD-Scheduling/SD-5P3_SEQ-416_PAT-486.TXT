Description:
============

   
 In October of 2006, patch SD*5.3*485 (EWL CORRECTION FOR ENROLLEE STATUS
 CALCULATION) was released to the field in order to correctly determine
 the EWL enrollee status. This patch changed the way the program utilizes
 the Treating Facility (TF) List file. For additional information on this
 process, please refer to the documentation for patch SD*5.3*485.
  
 This patch (SD*5.3*486) has been created to correct the EWL ENROLLEE
 STATUS field (#27) for those EWL records that were created prior to the
 installation of patch SD*5.3*485. This will ensure that all EWL records
 in the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3) have a correct EWL ENROLLEE STATUS.
  
 Due to the nature of the update process, this patch will be implemented
 in a phased approach, and will be coordinated by an Implementation
 Manager over the span of 3 to 4 weeks.
  
 A brief overview of the process follows. Please see the Installation
 Guide for the detailed instructions that will be needed to complete the
 process successfully. It is strongly suggested that a printed copy of
 the Installation Guide be available for reference during the install.
  
   1. Load patch SD*5.3*486.
  
   2. Use FTP to obtain a password protected and ZIPped VSSC data file 
      from a specified directory at the usual system servers. Passwords
      and directory information will be distributed by the Implementation
      Manager to the IRM staff member responsible for loading this patch.
      The VSSC file can be downloaded from specific servers at Albany
      (ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov), Hines (ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov), or 
      Salt Lake City (ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov). This process will take 
      between 15 to 30 minutes to complete the download. The ZIPped
      file is approximately 193 MB and the unzipped version of the
      file will require nearly 2 GB of storage space. NOTE: You may wish
      to store this file in a Temp subdirectory on your system for security
      purposes. Also, you must delete both the zipped and unzipped version
      of the file after completing the entire process (see step 9).
  
   3. Unzip the FLAK9.ZIP file using the UnZip utility in VMS. The result
      will be a file called FLAK9.CSV. The Unzip process may take between
      1-5 minutes. If your site does not have the current version of the 
      Zip and UnZip utilities, please see the Installation Guide for the
      instructions on how to obtain them.
  
   4. Use the BACKUP/RESTORE EWL PATIENT FILE UTILITY to make a backup of
      the current entries in the SD Wait List file. This backup, stored in
      the EWL CLEAN-UP (# 409.39) file, can be used to restore the EWL
      Enrollee Status for file entries should the need occur.
  
   5. The next step is to upload all VSSC records for patient entries in
      the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3). Each record will be reformatted to
      VA standard data format and stored in a temporary VistA file. This
      process requires approximately 30 to 60 minutes. 
  
   6. After the upload has been completed, a recalculation process will
      be started with the use of the CREATE ENROLLEE TEMP FILE option. It
      will use the VSSC file, the Treating Facility file, and the 
      Enrollment API to calculate the correct EWL Enrollee status. These
      results will be stored in the EWL CLEAN-UP (#409.39) file.
  
   7. The next step is to print and view these recalculations
      by using the ENROLLEE CLEANUP REPORT option. The option provides
      Fileman Print access to the file. A suggested FM Print is included
      in the Installation Guide. Sort and Print templates are included.
  
   8. Finally, the option APPLY/REPAIR ENROLLEE STATUS will be used to
      apply the recalculated EWL Enrollee Status. If there is a problem,
      the site may use the BACKUP/RESTORE EWL PATIENT FILE UTILITY to 
      restore the original EWL Enrollee Status for the involved records
      (those EWL records created prior to the installation of patch 
      SD*5.3*485).
  
   9. As part of the post-installation process, sites are required to:
      (a) delete the FLAK9.zip and FLAK9.csv files from your VMS account,
      and (b) remove the CLEAN-UP ENROLLEE STATUS menu and its associated
      options by using the REMOVE ENROLLEE STATUS MENU & OPTIONS option.
  
 The set of utilities are included in the CLEAN-UP ENROLLEE STATUS MENU,
 which is part of the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) menu. The options in the 
 Clean-Up menu are listed in the order in which they should be used. The
 menu is locked with the SDWL PARAMETER key.
