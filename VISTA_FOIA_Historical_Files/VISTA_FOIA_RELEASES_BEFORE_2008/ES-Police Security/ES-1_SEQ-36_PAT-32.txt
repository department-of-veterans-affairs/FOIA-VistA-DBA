 NOIS OVERVIEW
 =============
  
 1)  SBY-1099-32383     Late journal entry
  
     Problem
     -------
  
     The TIME entry prompt displays the latest time, not the desired last
     time that was entered (option ESP DAILY OPERATIONS JOURNAL add a 
     journal entry). The VA POLICE DAILY OPERATIONS JOURNAL was not printing
     in time sequence.
  
     Also, the data validity check of date/time for the FROM DATE and TO 
     DATE was allowing date/time not in the proper format.  For instance, 
     a date/time entry of 04-03-12@0700 was accepted even though the format
     should be only 04-03-12-0700 (YY-MM-DD-HHMM).
  
     Resolution
     ----------
  
     The ^ESPAJE program was changed to sort time in horolog format ($H) 
     to display the last (Oldest) time, not the latest time  entered. 
     The ^ESPJOU1 program was modified to sort and print the journal entries
     in horolog time sequence.
  
     The data dictionary fields for the FROM DATE/TIME and TO DATE/TIME 
     for Input Transform to insure only date/time format YY-MM-DD-HHMM is
     allowed at data entry point.
                        
       ****************** NOTE ***********************
  
 When using time frames across two days for your coverage period, sites 
 cannot cross 24 hour time periods between the first time and second
 time entered or else this sorting of times will not function properly.
 For instance, one cannot use 04-02-28-0600 to 04-02-29-0800, the 
 second time entered MUST precede 0600.
