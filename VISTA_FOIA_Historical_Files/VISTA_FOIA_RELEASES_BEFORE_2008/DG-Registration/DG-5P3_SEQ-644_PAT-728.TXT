Subject: Block FileMan Edits of Means Tests

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 There are sites that are editing two fields using FileMan to allow tests
 to be modified which should not be.  There fields are: PRIMARY INCOME 
 TEST FOR YEAR (FIELD 2) and SOURCE OF INCOME TEST (FIELD .23) in the
 Annual Means Test File #408.31.  Some of the MT Reversals in IVM 2.9 are
 due to manual editing of these records at the sites.   The only way to
 block the users from editing these two fields is to change the data
 dictionary to make the fields un-editable.
  
  
 Depending on the environment at your site, additional routines may be
 created during installation.  These are not core routines sent with the
 patch but rather a by-product of the changes made to the data
 dictionary in support of DG*5.3*728's DD changes.  If your environment
 does not require such routines, none will be created.
