Subject: DIAGNOSIS HISTORY UPDATE AND STUDENTS REJECTED BY PCE FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses 2 problems - 1) the incorrect updating of patient 
 diagnostic histories when using the Inquire - A&SP Patient [ACKQAS PAT INQ] 
 option and 2) PCE rejecting students sent as providers due to a missing  
 person class.

  NOIS OVERVIEW:
  ==============
 
  LIT-0502-70783  ACKQAS PAT INQ Option Problems
 
  Problem:
  --------
  Patient diagnostic histories are currently being rebuilt incorrectly when 
  rebuilding them via the "Do you want to update this patient's diagnostic 
  history NOW? NO//" prompt in the Inquire - A&SP Patient [ACKQAS PAT INQ] 
  option.  The DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION multiple (#2) of the A&SP PATIENT file 
  (#509850.2) is being rebuilt with all occurrences of all diagnostic  
  conditions and their corresponding entry dates from the A&SP CLINIC VISIT  
  file (#509850.6).  This is causing the diagnostic history list to display  
  the most recent date for each diagnostic condition, as reported in NOIS 
  LIT-0502-70783.
 
  Resolution:
  ----------- 
  The code has been modified to rebuild the DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION multiple   
  (#2) correctly, including only unique diagnostic codes and the earliest   
  date for which the diagnostic code was entered.  
 
  After this patch is installed, any patient diagnostic histories that were 
  incorrect as a result of this defect can be rebuilt (correctly) by looking 
  up the patient in the Inquire - A&SP Patient [ACKQAS PAT INQ] option and 
  answering "YES" to the "Do you want to update this patient's diagnostic 
  history NOW? NO//" prompt.
  
 
  LEB-0203-21311  Person Class Errors (primary call)
  LEB-0203-20600  Quasar Question
 
  Problem:
  --------
  The Student field (#7) is being included in the list of Secondary 
  Providers being sent to PCE.  This is causing records to be rejected by 
  PCE when the student does not have an active Person Class.  There is 
  currently no Person Class designated for students.
 
  Resolution:
  -----------
  After consulting with PCE, the solution agreed upon was to stop sending
  students as secondary providers.  This change will not affect the 
  Student field (#7) in the A&SP Clinic Visit file or data entry.  It will
  only eliminate this field from the array that is passed to PCE.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
  that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the
  impact on users of the QUASAR package.
  
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE   
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ACKQ*3.0*5):
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ACKQ*3.0*5.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options you 
     would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
     ACKQAS PAT INQ         Inquire - A&SP Patient
