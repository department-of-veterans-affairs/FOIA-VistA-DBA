Subject: OVERWRITING OF ACTIVITY LOG/LAST DISPENSE DATE/PRINTING BAD TEXT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. PSO*7*156 provided a two-way interface that returns a dispensing
 message to VistA from the dispensing machine that indicates
 dispensing of medication has completed.  When this dispensing message
 is returned the first entry in the activity log for the prescription is
 overwritten. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 2. When printing a prescription using a laser printer, the patient has a
 language preference other than English, and more than one prescription is
 entered and printed, text from the first prescription label is printing on
 the prescription labels that follows.
 NOISs: SAM-0604-21393, BAC-1203-40321, WIM-0604-20277
  
 3. When pulling an original fill early from suspense and printing
 prescription labels using a laser printer the last dispense date is not
 being updated correctly.  When prescriptions are pulled early from
 suspense the fill date and the last dispense date should always reflect the
 date the fill was pulled from suspense.

 is during non-peak hours for Outpatient Pharmacy users.

   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will 
      allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
      is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
