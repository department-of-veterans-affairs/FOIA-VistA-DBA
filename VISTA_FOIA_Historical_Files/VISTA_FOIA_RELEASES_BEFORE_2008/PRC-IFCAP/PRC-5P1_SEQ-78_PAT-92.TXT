 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 HD115527    FGH - REPEAT OF HD 109644
     
    Problem:
    -------- 
    Sites have been reporting a problem when using the PURCHASE ORDER
    DISPLAY [PRCH DISPLAY PO] option if they do a look-up by vendor.  In
    some cases, different results are obtained if the look-up is done by
    vendor number rather than by vendor name.  The problem has been traced
    to the code for the Convert Temporary 2237 to PC Request option
    [PRCH CONV TEMP] which incorrectly stores vendor information in the "C"
    cross reference of the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file [#442].
    In the past, a temporary fix was implemented by reindexing the "C" cross
    reference.  
  
    Note:  Reindexing file #442 using FileMan is not recommended due to the
           reverse-order numbering scheme used for entries in this file.
      
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A permanent resolution is obtained by removing the code which sets the
    wrong cross reference.  This patch also has a post install routine which
    removes any erroneous, vendor related entries in the "C" cross reference.
     
    A post init routine is included which $Orders through the "C" xref and
    compares the subscript value to the appropriate portion of the
    associated .01 field.  If the values do not match, the entry in the "C"
    xref is removed.
