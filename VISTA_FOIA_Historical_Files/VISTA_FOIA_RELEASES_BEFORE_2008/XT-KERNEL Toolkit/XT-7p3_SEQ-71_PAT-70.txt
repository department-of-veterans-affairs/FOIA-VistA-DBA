 This patch adds TOOLKIT support for the GT.M Mumps implementation and 
 provides support for the BCMA backup plan that is running on GT.M over 
 Linux.  The approach of GT.M is different that other MUMPS vendors.
 Support is provided for both GT.M on VMS and GT.M on Linux. Like Cache, 
 GT.M does not have UCI's.  Unlike others each routine is a separate file
 on the host OS. GT.M does not have a ZLOAD or ZSAVE, so several utilities
 had to be fixed. There is a open source version of GT.M for Linux at 
 http://sourceforge.net/ VistA had several tools that made use of ZL, ZS, 
 ZR, ZI.  This have been changed to use the ^%ZOSF("LOAD") and 
 ^%ZOSF("SAVE").  
 In XTEDTVXD support has been added for GT.M and Cache/VMS. 
 The ALTERNATE EDITOR entry for Cache: 
  
 NAME: VMSEDT - CACHE
   ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE: G CACHE^XTEDTVXD
   OK TO RUN TEST: I $ZV["VMS"
  DESCRIPTION:   
  Call to the VAX VMS EDT editor to process FileMan word processing fields.
  Creates a temporary VMS file in the default directory with a name of
  'DIWE$'_$JOB_'.TMP'.  This version will remove the two copies of the file
  that EDT leaves behind.
  
 NAME: VMSEDT - GTM
   ACTIVATION CODE FROM DIWE: G GTMVMS^XTEDTVXD
   OK TO RUN TEST: I $ZV["VMS"
  DESCRIPTION:   
  Call to the VAX VMS EDT editor to process FileMan word processing fields.
  Creates a temporary VMS file in the default directory with a name of
  'DIWE$'_$JOB_'.TMP'.  This version will remove the two copies of the file
  that EDT leaves behind.
  
 XTRMON will now work with GT.M and for object only routines in Cache.
  
 Also fixed:
 NOIS: PBG-0502-N2994
 In XTVNUM at the "Package" prompt you could enter return and have a empty
 package name.  This has been fixed by changing the DIR(0) from "FO" to "F".
 Problem: The routine XTRMON would get an error if it tried to check a 
 object only routine like MDE.
 Fix: XTRMON has been changed to avoid the problem.

 =========================================================================
 Installation:
  
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
  
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you may need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   5.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XT*7.3*70'
                              =========
                              
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
  
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
  
   6.  After installing this patch,
       Cache/GT.M Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
       DSM sites - you need to move two routines from
       your production account to each manager account:
  
       ZTP1
       ZTPP
             
   7.  And in the manager account,  (Cache/GT.M sites remain in VAH)
       All sites:
       DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
       Select the System
       Patch number to load: 70
                             ===
  
   8.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
