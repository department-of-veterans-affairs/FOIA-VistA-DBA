Subject: INTERFACING OF MEDICAL DEVICES WITH QUASAR AND THE DALC

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

 The QUASAR (Quality: Audiology and Speech Analysis and Reporting) 
 Audiogram Module currently contains an interface to the  Denver
 Acquisition & Logistics Center  (DALC) database.  The data is passed from
 the QUASAR application (AUDIOMETRIC EXAM  DATA file #509850.9) to the DALC
 database utilizing the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (VistA) MailMan interface.  The existing  functionality of
 the software has been maintained.
  
 The following vendors have supplied Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) that
 implement a simple interface to the QUASAR Audiogram Module:
  
      - GSI 61 (Grason-Stadler)
      - Madsen Aurical (GN Otometrics)
      - Interacoustics AC40 (Affinity)
  
 When the QUASAR Audiogram Module requests audiometric measurements, the
 vendor software responds with the memory address of a small Extensible 
 Markup Language (XML) document representing the results of the request.
 The QUASAR Audiogram Module then retrieves the results and feeds the 
 information into the VistA/QUASAR Audiometric Exam database.
  
  This patch contains the following enhancements & changes:
  =========================================================
      [1] Configure one of three audiometric instruments listed above.
      [2] Check and monitor the status of device connection.
      [3] Import audiometric data from the audiometer to the VistA database
          either point-by-point or batch mode. 
      [4] Reset values in audiometers capable of being reset and clear any
          buffers or memory used in the construction or passing of
          information.
      [5] Incorporates the graph (originally in the Graphical 
          User Interface (GUI) Audiogram Display  module) into the tabbed
          Audiogram Edit pages.  This graphic display will be updated in
          real time with data from the device.
      [6] The following items have been added or modified to display within
          the surrounding area of the audiogram display:
          A.  Air conduction averages.
          B.  Audiogram symbol key, No Response, Rollover Index boxes &
              Speech Reception Threshold (SRT), Ipsilateral Acoustic 
              Reflex (IAR) and Contralateral Acoustic Reflex (CAR) grids.
      [7] Desktop access to the application has been removed. The QUASAR 
          Audiogram Module can be configured and accessed only through the
          Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Tools menu.
      [8] The algorithm for points on the graph uses the "Retest" value if
          there is no "Final" value.
      [9] The third row label on the Pure Tones tab changed from "Final or
          Masked" to "Masked".
     [10] The "Flip Tabs" option has been removed from the File menu.
     [11] A 1500 Hz column has been added to the Pure Tones tab for the
          Bone Conduction exam.
     [12] VA Form 10-2364 has been modified to conform to VA standards.
  
 The interface functionality transfers data for the following tests from  
 the audiometer:
  
     - Air Conduction (Left & Right Ears)
     - Bone Conduction (Left & Right Ears)
     - Speech Reception Threshold (Left & Right Ears)
     - Word Recognition Testing (Left & Right Ears)
  
 The data elements are associated with a selected patient within the QUASAR
 Audiogram Module.  Using clinical judgment supported by common practice
 standards, the user is able to edit the data values that have been
 retrieved from the audiometer.
  
  M Code
  ------
  1.  ACKQAG03 has been modified to suppress the MailMan notification sent
      to the user when an AUDIOMETRIC EXAM DATA file (#509850.9) record
      has been transmitted to the Denver ALC.
  
  2.  ACKQAG05 has been modified to replace Denver Distribution Center 
      (DDC) with DALC in the subject of the MailMan message that confirms
      the deletion of an AUDIOMETRIC EXAM DATA file (#509850.9) record from
      the local and DALC databases.
  
  3.  Remote procedure call ACKQAUD1 has been added to the ACKQROES3E 
      option in order to register the call to the Graph Display tab. The
      following remote procedure calls are no longer used and have
      been removed from the ACKQROES3E option:  XUS GET USER INFO, XUS 
      INTRO MSG, XWB CREATE CONTEXT, XWB GET VARIABLE VALUE, XWB GET
      BROKER INFO.

  508 Compliance:
  ==============
 The QUASAR Audiogram Module is not 508 compliant.  The QUASAR team is 
 working with the 508 team to establish 508 compliance.  508 Compliance is
 underway and will be in a future patch.
  
  Data Dictionary Changes: 
  =======================
  
 Phonetically-Balanced Maximum (PB Max) fields will be used to implement
 the following new functionality:
  
 The QUASAR Audiogram Module will allow the clinician to specify which Word
 Recognition test (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) for the left and right ears should be
 used for displaying the PB Max value.  If the test is not specified by the
 user, the QUASAR Audiogram Module will utilize current logic for
 displaying the PB Max value as the default behavior. This is necessary
 because some Word Recognition tests may include half-list values that
 cannot be reported as PB Max for some exam types.
  
 The following data dictionary changes have been approved by the database
 administrator:
  
  1.  Two fields have been added to the AUDIOMETRIC EXAM DATA
      file(#509850.9):

         with <ENTER>
      f. When prompted 'Delay Install(Minutes): 0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
      g. When prompted 'DEVICE: HOME//', respond with <ENTER> or a device.
  
   4. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using
      the KIDS 'Utilities...' [XPD UTILITY] option 'Install File Print'
      [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] and selecting this patch (ACKQ*3.0*13).
  
  GUI Installation:
  ----------------
 Follow the instructions provided in the QUASAR Audiogram Module  
 Installation and Implementation Guide (ACKQ3_0P13_IG.PDF).
  
  POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==============================
 Obtain the current driver installer for your device from the QUASAR 
 website at:
  
            http://vista.med.va.gov/clinicalspecialties/quasar
  
 You need to create a download account.  Click Downloads on the menu and
 follow the directions for creating an account.  After downloading the 
 appropriate installer, follow the instructions for installing the driver
 for your device.  The driver installation process varies from installer to
