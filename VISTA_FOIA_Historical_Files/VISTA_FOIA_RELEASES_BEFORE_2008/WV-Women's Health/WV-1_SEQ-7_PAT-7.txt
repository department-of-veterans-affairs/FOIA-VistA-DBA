 This patch makes the following changes:
  
 1) Permits the patient's future appointments to print in a notification
    letter.
  
 In order to print the patient's future appointments in a notification
 letter, the Women's Health (WH) user must:
  
 a) Select the Add/Edit a Notification Purpose & Letter [WV ADD/EDIT NOT
    PURPOSE&LETTER] option on the File Maintenance Menu [WV MENU-FILE
    MAINTENANCE] menu.
 b) Select the notification letter which will display the future
    appointments.
 c) Answer NO to the Do you wish to delete the old letter for this
    Purpose of Notification and replace it with the generic sample letter?
    Enter Yes or No: NO// prompt.
 d) Navigate to the FORM LETTER (WP) field.
 e) In the text of the letter type "|APPOINTMENTS|" (without the quotes)
    along with any other text that should appear in the letter.
  
    For example, create a new paragraph:
  
    Your future appointments are:
    |APPOINTMENTS|
  
 Associated NOIS: IOW-1298-41206
  
 Data Dictionary(ies) affected: File 790, Field #2 (Subfile 790.09)
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVUTL9
  
 2) Package now makes use of a supported PIMS API, GETSTAT^DGMSTAPI, (DBIA
 #2716) to retrieve a patient's Military Sexual Trauma (MST) code when
 using the Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA] option.
 If the MST code is Y(es) and no value exists in the SEXUAL TRAUMA (#.27)
 field of the WV PATIENT (#790) file, then the MST code is used as a
 default value in the SEXUAL TRAUMA field.
  
 Note: The WH package retrieves and stores a patient's MST code from the
       PIMS database only when the WH user adds/edits that patient's entry
       with the Edit/Print Patient Case Data [WV EDIT PATIENT CASE DATA]
       option.
  
 Associated NOIS: none
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVUTL1A
  
 3) Fixed code that screens the selection of case managers. Before this
 patch, if the case manager entry in the WV CASE MANAGER (#790.01) file had
 any date value in the DATE INACTIVATED (#.02) field that entry was not
 selectable. After the installation of this patch, case manager entries
 with a future inactivation date will be selectable.
  
 Associated NOIS: HOU-0799-70064
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVUTL1A
  
 4) Replaced several direct global reads to the NEW PERSON (#200) file with
 supported FileMan calls. The WH package did not have a DBIA to do the
 direct global reads.
  
 Associated NOIS: none
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVPROF2, WVUTL1, WVUTL1A, WVUTL6, WVUTL7
  
 5) Fixed a bug in the Snapshot of the Program Today [WV PRINT SNAPSHOT]
 option where the Total Number of PAP Smears count was incorrectly
 calculated if there are entries in the WV REFUSALS (#790.3) file. Before
 the patch, the count was always the same, 4. After the patch, the count
 will be correct.
  
 Also, in the report text the word "facilities" was changed to "divisions".
  
 Associated NOIS: ISH-0499-41744
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVRPSNP, WVUTL7
  
 6) "Bulletproofed" the DOB (Date of Birth) subroutine in the WVUTL1
 routine to prevent an undefined global variable error when trying to
 determine a patient's date of birth for a PATIENT (#2) file entry that no
 longer exists, but is pointed to by the WH package.
  
 Associated NOIS: WPB-0699-31336
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVUTL1
  
 7) Modified the Automatically Load Patients [WV AUTOLOAD PATIENTS] option
 to allow facilities to mass load patients into the WH package using the
 PRIMARY ELIGIBILITY CODE code from the PATIENT (#2) file. Before the
 patch, the option distinguished between veteran and non-veteran status
 only. After the patch, the user may add non-veterans that have the primary
 eligibility code selected by the user.
  
 Associated NOIS: none
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVGETALL, WVGETAL1
  
 8) Fixed code to prevent the sending of an informational mail message to
 the ordering provider when a Radiology/NM package exam is passed to the WH
 package. Before the patch, the ordering provider and the patient's WH case
 manager were sent a mail message. After the patch, the patient's WH case
 manager will get the mail message only.
  
 Associated NOIS: CLE-0399-42463
                  ASH-0699-31886
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVRADWP
  
 9) Modified the input transform of the PRINT DATE (#.11) field in the WV
 NOTIFICATION (#790.4) file to default to the next year if only the month
 and day value has been entered and that month/day has already passed in
 this year.
  
 Associated NOIS: WIM-0599-21375
  
 Data Dictionary(ies) affected: File 790.4, Field .11

 display the Laboratory package accession number if one exists for the WH
 procedure entry.
  
 Associated NOIS: None

 The post installation routine will check the previous Snapshot of the
 Program Today reports saved in the WV SNAPSHOT REPORTS (#790.71) file and
 will inserted a 0 (zero) for each of these new procedures in the Refusals
 for Treatment section.

                                These are new fields added to the FILE

                                These are existing FILE 790.71 data
                                dictionary fields that were modified to
                                reduce the maximum number which can be
                                entered for these numeric type fields.

 too.
  
 Also, in the report text the word "facilities" was changed to "divisions".
  
 Associated NOIS: None
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVUTL7, WVRPSCR1, WVRPSCR2
  
 16) Fixed a bug in the Browse Patients With Needs Past Due [WV BROWSE

 '1' (Date Delinquent) to the "Display Procedures in order of:" prompt, the
 sorting order of the entries was incorrect.
  
 Before this patch, deceased patients could appear on the report output.
 After the patch, deceased patients will not appear on the report output

 both the breast and cervical treatment needs will not appear on this
 report.
  
 Associated NOIS: POR-0199-52802
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVBRNED

 "Not Indicated".

 Associated NOIS: None
  
 Routine(s) affected: WVRPSNP
  
 20) Modified the link with the Radiology/NM package to remove "hardcoded"

 3) (Optional) Run the following KIDS options before installing the patch:
  
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Verify Checksums in Transport Global
               Backup a Transport Global
