Subject: Name Standardization Wrong File Component Deletion

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch corrects the following issue:
  
 If the file number being passed to API, DELCOMP^XLFNAME2, begins with the
 same number as another file that is registered in the NAME COMPONENTS file
 (#20), then the Name Component's entry for that file maybe deleted, instead
 of the Name Component for the file that was passed. For example, if the
 file number being passed is 2, meaning delete the Name Component entry for
 an entry in the PATIENT file (#2), then there was a possibility that the
 Name Component entry for an entry in file 200 would be deleted.  This is
 because the "X" flag for an exact match was not passed in the $$FIND1^DIC
 call.
