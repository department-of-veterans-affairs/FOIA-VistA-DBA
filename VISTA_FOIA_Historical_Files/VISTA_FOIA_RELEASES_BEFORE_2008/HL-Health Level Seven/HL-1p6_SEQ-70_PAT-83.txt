Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 Patch HL*1.6*83
  
 NOIS: ISA-0800-11764
 Test Sites: FO-ALBANY, Grand Junction VAMC, San Francisco VAMC
 If VistA HL7 is processing an HL7 message, and calls the API UPD^HLSUB
 to add/update a subscription, and the 5th parameter indicates that the
 termination date should be deleted, and there's already a subscription
 with a termination date, it fails to delete the termination date.
 This patch fixes that. 
  
 NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when activity is at
 a minimum.  It requires HL7 patch HL*1.6*66.
