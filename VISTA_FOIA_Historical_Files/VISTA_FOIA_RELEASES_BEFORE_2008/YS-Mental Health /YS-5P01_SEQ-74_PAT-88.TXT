Subject: ERRONEOUS PROGRESS NOTE CREATED MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Under certain conditions when entering an ASI for an Outpatient in the 
 Roll and Scroll option, Progress Notes are NOT created. If an existing
 visit is entered as a New visit, the screen displays a message Progress 
 Notes Created when in fact they were not created.
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY/NOIS:
 ======================

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 =============
 1. FGH-0704-30819
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User has 2 ASI records that he is electronically signing in VISTA and
 responding yes to creating progress note. He responds No to auto sign 
 prompt. These records are not creating a progress note.  The Mental 
 Health routine calls a TIU API to verify visit information.  The Mental 
 Health routine incorrectly interprets what is returned from the TIU API
 and always displays Progress Note Created.  This happens even when the
 visit information fails the TIU visit check and no entry is made in the 
 TIU Document file (8925).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine YSASPNT was modified to correctly interpret the value returned by 
 the TIU API. If the visit is valid a message "Progress Note Created" will 
 display and an entry will be made in TIU Document File (8925).  If the 
 visit is not valid the message "Progress Note has NOT been created -
 please select the existing appointment" will display and no entry will be 
 made in the TIU Document File (8925).

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system but it is suggested 
 that it be loaded during hours of non-peak activity.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the 
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
     mapped set at this time.
  
 3. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]: 
  
           Edits and Distribution ...  
           Utilities ...  
           Installation ...  
  
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
           1      Load a Distribution
           2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           3      Print Transport Global
           4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
           5      Backup a Transport Global
           6      Install Package(s)
                  Restart Install of Package(s)
                  Unload a Distribution
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter YS*5.01*88):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package YD*5.01*88.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//', respond NO
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES. When prompted to select the options 
 you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
         YSAS ADD/EDIT ASI     Add/Edit ASI
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
  
     NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or if
     you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
