 This patch contains the following problem resolutions and modifications.
 
 This patch resolves the following NOIS calls:
 
 NOIS HUN-1204-20076 (<UNDEFINED>ONCPL+16^ONCPL invalid CPT Code)
 NOIS DET-1104-40170 (Error out on First Course of Treatment)
 NOIS TAM-0105-31312 (SUBSCRIPT ERROR  SURR+3~ONCUTX)
 
  1) FORDS Errata: September 2004
 
     In accordance with "FORDS Errata: September 2004" the following changes
     have been made:
 
     a) SPANISH ORIGIN (#160,9)
        Code 8 (Dominican Republic) has been added to SPANISH ORIGIN.
 
     b) DERIVED AJCC T DESCRIPTOR (#165.5,161)
        DERIVED AJCC N DESCRIPTOR (#165.5,163)
        DERIVED AJCC M DESCRIPTOR (#165.5,165)
 
        Code 0 (Not derived) has been added to the above fields.
 
     c) PATHOLOGIC N (#165.5,86)
        AJCC CANCER STAGING MANUAL SIXTH EDITION
        BREAST (C50.0-C50.9)
 
        The following codes have been added to SIXTH EDITION PATHOLOGIC N
        for BREAST cases:
 
        N0(i-)   No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, negative IHC
        NO(i+)   No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive IHC,
                   no IHC cluster greater than 0.2 mm
        N0(mol-) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, negative
                   molecular findings (RT-PCR)
        NO(mol+) No regional lymph node metastasis histologically, positive
                   molecular findings (RT-PCR)
 
  2) SIMULTANEOUS ACCESSIONING BY MULTIPLE USERS
 
     When accessioning, there is a brief moment when the program is determining
     the next available ACCESSION NUMBER.  In order to avoid the possibility
     of two primaries getting the same ACCESSION NUMBER, this process is a
     "single file" process.  If two users are simultaneously computing the
     next available number, the second user may encounter the message:
 
     Another terminal is accessioning.  Try Again? Y//
 
     PROBLEM: At the time this question was asked a partial primary record had
     already been created.  If the user answered YES, this partial primary was
     deleted and the user started over.  If the user answered NO, the partial
     primary record was retained with no ACCESSION NUMBER.  This was causing
     problems.
 
     To resolve this problem we have made the following changes:
 
     a) If two users are simultaneously trying to obtain the next available
        ACCESSION NUMBER the second user will encounter the following question:
        
        Another user is accessioning.  Try Again? Y//
 
        If the user answers YES the program will wait 2 seconds and try again.
        This process will continue until the first user has successfully
        obtained the next available number.
 
        If the user answers NO the program will exit.
        
     b) The primary record will not be created until a valid ACCESSION NUMBER
        has been computed.
 
  3) NEW FACILITY FILE (#160.19) ENTRIES
 
     The following entries have been added to the FACILITY file:
 
     10000470    ALASKA VA HCS
     10000471    VA SOUTHERN NEVADA HCS
     6839029     SHERIDAN VAMC
 
  4) MISSPELLINGS
 
     The following fields contained misspellings in their code descriptions:
 
     OTHER TREATMENT              (#165.5,57.2)
     OTHER TREATMENT @FAC         (#165.5,57.3)
     TYPE OF SUBSEQUENT RADIATION (#165.5,1375) 
 
     The code 9 descriptions contained a misspelling of "Unkown".  These 
     have been fixed.
 
  5) GIST (8936/) OF ESOPHAGUS (C15), STOMACH (C16), SMALL INTESTINE (C17) 
     AND COLON (C18)
 
     There is no TNM coding or staging schema for AJCC 6th Edition 
     ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, SMALL INTESTINE or COLON cases with an HISTOLOGY
     (ICD-O-3) value of GIST (GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL) (8936/0, 8936/1,
     8936/2 or 8936/3).  For these cases the TNM and staging fields will be
     stuffed the appropriate "no staging" values.
 
  6) REGIONAL TREATMENT MODALITY (#165.5,363)
 
     Codes 80 and 85 are not appropriate for 2003+ cases.  These codes have
     been screened out for 2003 + cases.
 
  7) DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE  (#165.5,170)
     MOST DEFINITIVE SURG DATE      (#165.5,50)
     MOST DEFINITIVE SURG @FAC DATE (#165.5,50.3)
 
     A new field, DATE FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE, has been added to the First
     Course of Treatment portion of the abstract.  For existing primaries 
     this field will be seeded with the earliest of the following date fields:
 
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY DATE   (#165.5,50)
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY DATE  (#165.5,138.2)
     SURG PROC/OTHER SITE DATE (#165.5,139.2)
 
     For new primaries this field will be prompted for.
 
     Also, the following fields have been renamed:
 
     Old name                       New Name
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY DATE        MOST DEFINITIVE SURG DATE
     SURGERY OF PRIMARY @FAC DATE   MOST DEFINITIVE SURG @FAC DATE
 
  8) NOIS HUN-1204-20076 (<UNDEFINED>ONCPL+16^ONCPL invalid CPT Code)
     PROBLEM LIST
 
     If the returned PROBLEM LIST contained an invalid ICD DIAGNOSIS code,
     the program would abort with an <UNDEFINED> error.  This has been 
     fixed.  Problems on the PROBLEM LIST which contain invalid ICD DIAGNOSIS
     codes will now be bypassed and not displayed.
 
  9) NOIS DET-1104-40170 (Error out on First Course of Treatment)
 
     For pre-2004 Testis (C62.) cases, if the registrar entered 99 (Unknown;
     death certificate ONLY) at the SURGERY OF PRIMARY (R) (#165.5,58.2)
     prompt, the program would abort with an <UNDEFINED> error.  This has
     been fixed. 
 
 10) ACCESSORY (PARANASAL) SINUSES
     C31.2-C31.3, C31.8-C31.9)
 
     AJCC does not define TNM staging for these sites:
 
     SINUS, FRONTAL           C31.2
     SINUS, SPHENOID          C31.3
     SINUS, ACCESSORY OVERLAP C31.8
     SINUS, ACCESSORY NOS     C31.9
 
     These sites will now be stuffed with the appropriate "no staging" 
     values.
 
 11) RX TEXT-SURGERY (#165.5,108)
 
     The logic which deletes the RX TEXT-SURGERY text if there in no SURGERY 
     OF PRIMARY, SCOPE OF LN SURGERY or SURG PROC/OTHER SITE has been removed.
     RX TEXT-SURGERY text may now be entered and retained regardless of the
     surgery code values.
 
 12) LATERALITY (#165.5,28) code 9
 
     In order to be consistent with the FORDS manual, the definition of
     LATERALITY code 9 has been expanded.
 
     Old definition                      
     --------------
     Paired site, lateral origin unknown
 
     New definition
     --------------
     Paired site, but lateral origin unknown, midline tumor
  
 13) OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF (#165.5,223)
 
     A new inter-field edit has been added.
 
     If DIAGNOSTIC CONFIRMATION > 5 and SEQUENCE NUMBER > 00, an inter-field
     edit warning will be displayed advising the registrar that the 
     over-ride field OVERRIDE HOSPSEQ/DXCONF should be set to "Reviewed".
 
 14) REGIONAL LYMPH NODES EXAMINED (#165.5,33)
     REGIONAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE (#165.5,32)
 
     If the REGIONAL LYMPH NODES EXAMINED value was in the range 00-90 and 
     the REGIONAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE value was in the range 95-99, the
     program would disallow the REGIONAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE value and
     display the HELP-PROMPT message: "Regional Lymph Nodes Positive cannot
     exceed Regional Lymph Nodes Examined".  This was incorrect and has been
     fixed.  The REGIONAL LYMPH NODES POSITIVE values 95-99 have special
     meanings and should not be interpreted as numeric values.
 
 15) COLLABORATIVE STAGING FIELDS "REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION"
 
     The following Collaborative Staging fields are now "required for
     completion".  i.e. In order to set the ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5,91)
     to 3 (Complete), these fields must be filled in.
 
     TUMOR SIZE (CS)             (#165.5,29.2)

 16) NOIS TAM-0105-31312 (SUBSCRIPT ERROR  SURR+3~ONCUTX)
 
     For pre-2004 Lymph Node (C77.) cases, if the registrar entered 99
     (Unknown; death certificate ONLY) at the SURGERY OF PRIMARY (R)
     (#165.5,58.2) prompt, the program would abort with a <SUBSCRIPT> error.
     This has been fixed. 
 
 17) REASON NO SURGERY OF PRIMARY (#165.5,58)
 
     REASON FOR NO SURGERY has been renamed REASON NO SURGERY OF PRIMARY.
     It has also been repositioned in the abstract dialog of appear after
     MOST DEFINITIVE SURG @FAC DATE (#165.5,50.3).
 
 18) TREATMENT PLAN                 (165.5,42)
     TREATMENT                      (165.5,43)
     FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT DATE (165.5,49)
 
     The computed fields TREATMENT PLAN, TREATMENT and FIRST COURSE OF 
     TREATMENT DATE have been modified to exclude SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) 
     (165.5,138.4) and SURG PROC/OTHER SITE (165.5,139.4) from the computation.
     Only SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) will be considered a "surgical treatment" 
     for the purposes of these fields.
