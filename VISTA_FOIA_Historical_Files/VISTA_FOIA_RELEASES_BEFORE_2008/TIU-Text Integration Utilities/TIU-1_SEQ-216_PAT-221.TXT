Subject: FIX PROBLEMS WITH ALERTS AND UPLOADED DOCUMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses problems with the sending of addendum alerts when an 
 additional signer is past due for signing and the sending of alerts on 
 retracted documents.  It also fixes a problem on uploaded documents being 
 associated with the incorrect appointment.
  
 ASSOCIATED Remedy:
 ================
 1. HD92334  Users receiving alerts on retracted TIU documents
 2. HD129055 Addendum alerts being regenerated by TIU NIGHT JOB
 3. HD147620 Uploads to wrong visit

 OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. HD92334 Users receive alerts on retracted documents.
  
    Resolution:  In the TIU NIGHT JOB routine do not send an alert if the 
    document has a status of Retracted.
  
 2. HD129055 Addendum alerts being regenerated by TIU NIGHT JOB.  If there 
    is an additional signer that is past due for signature on an addendum, 
    the addendum alert to the original author/cosigner is regenerated each 
    time the night job is run.
  
    Resolution:  If the document is past due for an additional signature, 
    do not send the addendum alert to the original author/cosigner.
  
 3. HD147620 Uploads to wrong visit.  If there are multiple visits to a 
    CLINIC on the same day, an uploaded document will always be associated 
    with the last appointment, even if the correct appointment is on the 
    uploaded document.
  
    Resolution:  If there is more than one appointment for a clinic on a 
    day, the uploaded document will select the appointment with the exact 
    date/time of the visit data on the upload.  If there is not an exact 
    date/time match a filing error alert will be generated so the correct 
    visit can be selected.
