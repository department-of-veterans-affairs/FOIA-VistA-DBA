Subject: INCORRECT MONTHLY DATA STORAGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
   1. When sites do not process all uploaded invoices, problems arise when 
   the next batch of invoices is uploaded. Drug Accountability attempts to 
   match each item with items in the DRUG file (#50). The process will
   continue to add matching data to the item. If the invoices remain on the  
   system long enough an error will occur.
   
   The solution to this is to bypass the matching process on invoice data 
   that has already been uploaded.  
   
   2. Another problem this patch corrects is with the filing of monthly data 
   on drug items. Monthly data was incorrectly stored for some items in 
   the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8). This patch corrects already 
   affected entries, and restricts the erroneous filing of incorrect data 
   in the future.

   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
 ******************************* N O T E *******************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
 problems.
 ***********************************************************************
   Due to the post-installation conversion process, this patch should be 
   installed at non-peak hours.
   
   Installation time varies according to the number of pharmacy locations
   set-up at each facility. Because of the volumes of data to search for
   problems, the installation could take several hours.
   
   Pharmacy users must be off the system during the install.
   
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours
   
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option in the PackMan function.
   
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
   3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option, select
      the Installation Option.
   
   4. From this option, you may select to use the following items:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSA*3.0*37).
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSA*3.0*37.
   
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
      respond NO.
    
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//" respond  NO.
    
   8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.
   
   9. The post installation process should be queued to run when system usage
      is at its lowest point. Below is an example of the process:
   
   EXAMPLE:
   --------
   PSA*3*37 corrects errors that may have occurred while storing monthly data.
   This correction process varies according to the number of pharmacy
   locations.
   
   Therefore it is highly recommended that you queue this task to run at a 
   time when system usage is at a minimum.
   
   Requested Start Time: NOW//
   
   10. After the post-installation routine (PSAP31) runs, it will
       automatically be deleted from your system by routine PSAVSN.
