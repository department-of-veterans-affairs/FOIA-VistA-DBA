Description:
============

 As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
 a new commercial data source is utilized to provide warning label 
 information. 
  
 A parameter was provided by patch PSS*1*87 to turn on the new warning
 label format. This is currently being used in association with printing
 laser labels. However, since not all Consolidated Mail Outpatient
 Pharmacy (CMOP) facilities are reprogrammed to receive the new format, a
 new parameter is being added for turning on the new warnings for CMOP. And
 another parameter is being added to turn on sending the new warnings to
 the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI). This is to 
 accommodate vendors who may need to make changes to receive the new 
 warnings.
  
 Currently the Bedford CMOP is the only CMOP not ready to receive the new
 format.
  
 Until the parameters are turned on, warning labels from the old RX CONSULT
 file (#54) are used. When they are turned on, warnings from the WARNING
 LABEL-ENGLISH (#50.625) or the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH (#50.626) file will
 be used. When the parameters are turned on, the "Do not transfer" warning
 label 20 from the old RX CONSULT file (#54) is automatically added, when
 applicable, during label printing, transmitting to CMOP, or sending to
 OPAI.
  
 Example warning labels for a drug when the warning source is set to "New":
  
   Take medication on an empty stomach one hour before or two to three 
   hours after a meal unless otherwise directed by your doctor.
  
   This drug may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery. Use care
   until you become familiar with its effects.
  
   CAUTION: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person
   other than the patient for whom it was prescribed.
  
  
 The new parameters added by this patch will be used by a new patch
 PSO*7*200 to send the new warning label text to OPAI and by PSX*2*54 which
 will send the new warning label text to CMOP.
  
  
 The following changes are included in this patch:

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  
  The revised User and Technical Manuals are available on the

  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
   1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from
