  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation will take 
  less than 2 minutes.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE
      SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped

   4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ES*1.0*26.)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option creates a MailMan
         message that will backup all current routines on your system
         that would be replaced by the Packages in this Transport 
         Global. Those components that are not routines must be backed
         up separately if they need to be preserved.  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option lets
         you compare the components of a Transport Global, that is 
         currently loaded in the XTMP global, to your current system. 
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
         verify checksums for the components of a Transport Global and
         will report any checksums that are incorrect. 
      d. Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the
         contents of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in
         the ^XTMP global. 
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ES*1.0*26.

   7. If a routine was unmapped as part of step 2, it should be returned
      to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
