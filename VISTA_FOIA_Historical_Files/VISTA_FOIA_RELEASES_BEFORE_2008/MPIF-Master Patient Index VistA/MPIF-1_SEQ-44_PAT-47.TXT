Subject: Reschedule MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  NOTE: RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems to
  avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities.
  
  It is being requested the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB be placed back in 
  order and scheduled to run again via TaskMan.  This is being requested 
  to ensure that any outstanding CMOR Change Requests are processed.  Sites
  could still make CMOR Change Requests until they install MPIF*1.0*44.
  Once all outstanding requests have been processed, the MPIF CMOR REQUEST
  AUTO JOB can be unscheduled and placed out of order.  It may take up to
  15 days for all requests to process thru the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB
  as it processes requests older than 14 days.
  
  Procedure to be done now:
  
  1. Place the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB option back in order by deleting
     the text from the OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE (#2) field for the MPIF CMOR 
     REQUEST AUTO JOB entry in the OPTION file (#19).  
  
  2. Schedule the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB option via Taskman to run with
     a frequency of once per day (1D) after normal working hours.
  
  
  Since all sites had the patch installed by March 12th, the MPIF CMOR 
  REQUEST AUTO JOB can be unscheduled and placed out of order on March
  27th.
  
  Procedure to be done on March 27th:
  
  1.  Unschedule the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB option via Taskman.
  
  2.  Place the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB option back out of order by 
      placing "Obsolete with MPIF*1.0*44." for the OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE
      field (#2) for the MPIF CMOR REQUEST AUTO JOB entry in the OPTION
      file (#19).
