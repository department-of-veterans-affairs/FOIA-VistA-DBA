Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides the annual update to the DRG Grouper v25.0.  It is  
 the second phase of the FY 2008 ICD/DRG Update and is the follow up to 
 patch LEX*2.0*52. 
  
 No code files are included in the patch, as all changes are contained in 
 the pre-init routines ICD1831*.
  
 OVERVIEW
 ---------------
 The changes were published in the Federal Register/Vol. 72, No. 162/ 
 Wednesday, August 22, 2007/ Rules and Regulations.  Below is an outline 
 of changes made.  Please refer to the Federal Register for a complete 
 list.  The changes were extensive and are too great in number to be 
 listed.  Resource documents can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/.
  
 The following have been addressed in the patch. 
  
 Changes to  DRG Classifications and Relative Weights
 -       DRG Reclassifications
 -       Refinement of DRGs Based on Severity of Illness
 -       Refinement of the Relative Weight Calculation
 -       Changes to Specific DRG Classifications
 o       1.  Pre-MDCs: Intestinal Transplantation
 o       2.  MDC 1 (Diseases and Disorders of the Nervous System)
 o       3.  MDC3 (Diseases and Disorders of the Ear, Nose, Mouth, and 
             Throat) - Cochlear Implants
 o       4.  MDC 8 (Diseases and Disorders fo the Musculoskeletal System 
             and Connective Tissue)
 o       5.  MDC 17 (Myeloproliferative Diseases and Disorders, Poorly 
             Differentiated Neoplasm): Endoscopic Procedures
 o       6.  Medicare Code Editor (MCE) Changes
 o       7.  Surgical Hierarchies
 o       8.  Review of Procedure Codes in CMS DRGs 468, 476, and 477
 o       9.  Other DRG Issues Addressed in the FY 2008 IPPS Proposed Rule
 o       10. Other MS-DRG Issues Raised in the PUBLIC Comments on the 
             Proposed Rule
 o       11. Changes to MS-DRG Logic as a Result of Public Comments
 o       12. Recalibration of DRG Weights
  
 Impact of the MS-DRG(s):
  
 Payment for FY 2008 is based on the redistribution of weights within each 
 base MS-DRG.  Such a result occurs because of the collapse of the current 
 CC/non-CC, age and other distinctions that exist in the CMS DRG(s) and 
 the division of them based on MCCs, CCs, and non-CCs.  Thus, within each 
 base MS-DRG some cases will be paid more and some less, but the base 
 MS-DRG(s) are retained so there is no redistribution between types of 
 cases as they have occurred under the proposed CS DRG(s).  Please review 
 Table 5 In the Addendum to the proposed rule as listed in the Federal 
 Register for the is list of  the proposed MS-DRG(s) and the proposed 
 respective weight from the revisions proposed to better recognize 
 severity of illness and to better understand how payment for cases within 
 each base MS-DRG will be affected.
  
 There are significant changes from the CMS-DRG structure to the MS-DRG 
 structure.  We have included a conversion routine set to convert entries 
 from the CMS-DRG to the new MS-DRG(s).  For further detail, please refer 
 to the Federal Register.  We have also included logic in the ICDDRG* 
 routines to not only continue to refer to the CMS-DRG(s) for fiscal years 
 prior to 2008 but also determine the MS-DRG(s) for FY 2008.
  
 There are edits and additional DRG(s) included in this years annual 
 update.  Please refer to the Federal Register for a complete list of 
 changes.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch does not involve global file restoration.  However, we 
 strongly suggest you create global saves on files #80 (^ICD9), #80.1 
 (^ICD0) and #80.2 (^ICD) in the event problems develop during the 
 install.  If it becomes necessary to use the saved files, you should 
 first kill all of the records before applying the global restores.
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
                       PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU]
  
 Install Time - less than 30 minutes
