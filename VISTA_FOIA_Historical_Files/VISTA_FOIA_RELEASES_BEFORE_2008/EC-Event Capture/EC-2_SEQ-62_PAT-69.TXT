 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 PTH-0804-22079: Queuing of Provider Summary Report (ECPROV) do not work
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When queuing a report from the option 'Provider Summary Report (ECPROV)
    it requires 132 columns. The printer it is queued to has a default 
    subtype which is 80 columns and 10 pitch. An alternate subtype with 132
    columns and 16 pitch is attached to printer selection but does not work.
    Looks like the routine that queues this option does not send 
    this alternate printer definition.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The patch modified routine ECPROV2 to set ZTIO variable to the following
    ZTIO=ION_";"_IOST_";"_IOM_";"_IOSL.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended that
 it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
     2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
        be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
     3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
     4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*69)
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
          the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
     5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package EC*2.0*69.
  
     6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//" respond NO.
  
     7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
     8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
        returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
        completion.
  
  
     NOTE:  Details of the changes applied by this patch are provided
     during the installation and may also be reviewed with the Install File
     Print option on the Utilities menu in the Kernel Installation and
     Distribution System
