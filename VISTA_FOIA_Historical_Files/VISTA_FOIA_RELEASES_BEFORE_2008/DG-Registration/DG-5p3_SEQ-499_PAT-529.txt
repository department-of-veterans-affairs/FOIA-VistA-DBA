Description:

 time not closing, and the totals on the Bed Status Report not calculating
 properly and skipping lines.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1) CTX-0603-70866  SCHEDULED ADMISSION LIST
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the Scheduled Admissions List option [DG SCHED ADMIT 
    PRINT] under the ADT Outputs Menu, entries sometimes are listed under a
    Division of EMPTY.  This problem has been traced to the Schedule an 
    Admission option [DG SCHED ADMIT ENTRY] under the Bed Control Menu.
    If the user types W or Ward at the Ward or Treating Specialty prompt,
    any existing ward location is deleted.  If the user enters a new ward
    location and accepts the division default, the division name instead of
    division internal entry number is stored in the DIVISION (#12) field in
    the SCHEDULED ADMISSION (#41.1) file.  As a result, these entries are
    displayed on the Scheduled Admission List with no division.
  
    Solution:
    --------- 
    The triggers on the WARD OR TREATING SPECIALTY (#10) field have been
    modified to delete the values on the WARD (#8) or TREATING SPECIALTY (#9)
    fields only when a change is made in the WARD OR TREATING SPECIALTY 
    field.
    The software currently deletes these values if the user enters the same
    value at the WARD OR TREATING SPECIALTY prompt forcing the user to enter
    a Ward or Treating Specialty.
    The trigger cross reference on the WARD (#8) field in the SCHEDULED
    ADMISSION (#41.1) file has been modified to store the internal entry
    number for the division rather than the division name when editing a
    scheduled admission.
  
 2) LEX-0803-40313   PTF File-Time of Admission
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an Unauthorized Claim is entered into VistA, by the Fee Basis 
    Section it does not allow the input of time for admission or discharge.
    If this is a same day admission and discharge, the PTF record will 
    not close due to the following error:
  
         537 - Date of Movement earlier than Admission date.  
  
    Solution:
    ---------    
    The PTF close out error checking software has been modified to allow
    the movement date/time to be the same as the admission date/time 
    (i.e., error code 537 will not be generated for these).  The AAC has
    confirmed that the movement date/time can be the same as the admission
    date/time and will pass their error check.  ^DGPT501 was modified.
  
 3) TOP-0198-40089  CUM ADC ON BSR NOT TOTALLING CORRECTLY
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Cum ADC column is not totalling correctly on the Bed Status Report 
    [DG G&L SHEET] when one or more wards included in the total was placed 
    Out-of-Service (OOS) during the time period covered by the report. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    The Cum ADC was being calculated by taking the Cum Patient Days total 
    for all of the wards and dividing by the Total Elapsed Fiscal Days.  
    This does not account for individual wards being placed OOS for time 
    periods during the reporting period (Fiscal YTD). Routine ^DGPMBSP3
    has been modified to calculate the total Cum ADC by adding the ADCs 
    for the individual wards included in the total.
  
 4) HIN-0397-40014  BED STATUS REPORT TOTALS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites use the common practice of setting totals for certain Wards to
    "DON'T DISPLAY" (DG WARD DEFINITION option) for totals that are defined
    for inclusion in higher level total(s) without being displayed on the
    Bed Status Report (BSR).  When a Total is set as "DON'T DISPLAY", an
    undesirable blank line is printed in place of the total on the BSR.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours to minimize the
 impact on users of the Registration package.
  
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the ROUTINE   
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set 
     at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*529):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs, or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*529.
  
 6.  When prompted ' Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//', respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
