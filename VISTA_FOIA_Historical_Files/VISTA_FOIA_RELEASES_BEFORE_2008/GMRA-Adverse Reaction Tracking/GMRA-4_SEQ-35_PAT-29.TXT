Description:
============

 NOTE: Patch 29 has an implementation plan.  Please read the following
 section before installing this patch.
  
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
 ===================
 The installation of patch GMRA*4*29 will generate HL7 messages to update 
 the allergy data stored in the Health Data Repository (HDR). Patch 
 GMRA*4*36 was nationally released on March 20, 2007 with a post-install 
 e-mail message that included the number of allergy HL7 messages that 
 would be generated from the VistA site to the HDR.  All sites installed 
 the patch within the 30-day compliance date and the message counts were 
 collected.  It was determined that sites with greater than 20,000 
 messages could impact the HDR production system's ability to handle the 
 message volume efficiently.
  
 The following seven sites have been identified with 20,000 or more 
 allergy messages:
  
 VISN 2  - Upstate New York (Implementation Manager: Marianne Swift)
 VISN 8  - Bay Pines (Loren Behuniak)
 VISN 8  - Miami (Loren Behuniak)
 VISN 8  - N. Florida/S. Georgia (Loren Behuniak)
 VISN 9  - Tennessee Valley (Jane Lee)
 VISN 15 - Heartland West (Jane Lee)
 VISN 23 - Central Plains (Ed Ridley)
  
 These sites are asked to coordinate their installation of patch GMRA*4*29 
 with their Implementation Manager.  The Implementation Manager is 
 identified in parentheses above.  The guidance from the Health Data 
 Repository team is to recommend these sites install the patch on a 
 weekday evening after 8:00 PM Eastern Time.  The HDR is scheduled for a 
 weekly cold restart between Saturday at 10:00 PM Eastern Time and Sunday 
 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time.  It is not recommended that the Allergy patch 
 be installed during this time.
  
 Your Implementation Manager will be contacting you to discuss this patch 
 and determine the date and approximate time you plan to complete its 
 installation.  Again, this is for only the seven sites listed above.  All 
 other sites do not require this coordination and may install the patch at 
 their convenience.
  
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch will find all active free text allergies in the PATIENT 
 ALLERGIES (120.8) file and will update the entry in one of three ways 
 based on data in the conversion matrix.
  
 The conversion matrix is loaded into the ^XTMP global when the patch is
 installed and is used to determine how the free text entry should be 
 updated.
  
 If the free text allergy reactant is found in the conversion matrix then
 the allergy entry will be updated to the associated reactant from the
 matrix.
  
 Please note that when an existing free text allergy is updated to a
 standardized allergy term, the patient's allergy record will be updated
 with ingredient and/or drug class information.  The ingredient and/or drug
 class information will be used in future order checking but will not be
 used to perform any retrospective order checking on past or existing
 medication orders.
  
 If the free text allergy reactant is not found in the matrix or if 
 updating the reactant would cause a duplicate entry then the free text
 reactant is updated to include the phrase ( FREE TEXT ) after the
 reactant.  This will now serve as a visual cue that the allergy is a free
 text entry and will not be considered during order checking.
  
 Finally, if the matrix indicates that the reactant is an erroneous entry
 then the allergy will be marked as entered in error.
  
 If the entry was updated to a new entry or if the entry was marked as 
 entered in error, a comment will be added to the entry that was updated
 indicating the action that the patch took.    
  
 When the post-install has reviewed all active free text allergies a
 mailman message will be sent indicating the outcome of the conversion. The
 report will include the number of entries that were updated and will also
 report any entries that couldn't be updated and why that entry couldn't be
 updated.
  
 Upon completion of the update, the allergy free text utility can be used 
 to review the remaining free text entries for manual updating.
  
 INSTALLATION FILE
 =================
 The GMRA_4_29.KID host file may be obtained via FTP.  The preferred method
 is to FTP the files from:
  
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.  Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
    CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
    ----------------   -------------------------   --------------------
    Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
    Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]

 INSTALLATION
 ============
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that users not be using the allergy free text clean up utility
 while this is running.  The time to install this patch will vary depending
 on the number of allergy entries.
  
 **NOTE: Please be aware that the updating of allergy terms will likely 
 produce heavy traffic to the HDR.  If your site has a large number of 
 allergies to be updated you can expect a correspondingly large amount of 
 traffic to the HDR.  Please keep this in mind when determining when to 
 install this patch.
  
 **NOTE: DO NOT install this patch if you are on the list of controlled 
 sites (see above) without first coordinating your install per the above 
 listed instructions.
  
 1.  Obtain the file GMRA_4_29.KID.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  Use Load a Distribution using GMRA_4_29.KID when prompted to Enter a 
     host file name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMRA*4.0*29):
         a.  Backup a Transport Global
         b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
         c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRA*4.0*29.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
     you may respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond NO.
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
