Description:
============

 This patch updates the Surgery Risk Assessment software of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery
 application as requested by the Executive Board of the National Surgical
 Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and by the Cardiac Surgery Consultants
 Board of the Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP).
 The updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing 
 data fields, changes to data entry screens, changes to reports used in 
 Surgery Risk Assessment management process and changes to the Surgery Risk
 Assessment transmissions.
  
 Non-Cardiac Assessment Modifications
 ------------------------------------
  * Note: All fields named below are in the SURGERY file (#130) unless 
          otherwise indicated.
  
 - These updates include functionality for selecting cases for risk
   assessment based upon case Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes,
   replacing the use of the Major or Minor surgery definition.
    o When selecting a case to be assessed, the software will check the 
      case CPT codes and display an informational statement if no CPT codes
      have been assigned to the case or if the case should be excluded from
      assessment.
    o A new report called "List of Eligible Cases" is added to the reports 
      contained in the List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT 
      LIST] option.
    o The MAJOR/MINOR field (#.03) is removed from NSQIP input options and 
      from the Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] 
      option.
  
 - A new field called INTRAOPERATIVE ASCITES (#446) is created:
    o Added to the Operation Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA OPERATION DATA]
      option
    o Added to the Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] 
      option
    o Added to data set transmitted to the national database
  
 - A new field called CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS (#447) is created:
    o Added to the Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] 
      option
    o Added to the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORIES section of the 
      Surgery Quarterly Report
    o CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS is added as a new occurrence category 
      to the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file (#136.5)

      PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file (#136.5)
    o PULMONARY EMBOLISM field (#252) and the PULMONARY EMBOLISM occurrence
      category in file (#136.5)
    o ACUTE RENAL FAILURE field (#254) and the ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
      occurrence category in file (#136.5)
    o PREGNANCY field (#269)
    o PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY field (#287) and the PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY 
      occurrence category in the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file 
      (#136.5)
    o DYSPNEA field (#325)
    o CURRENT PNEUMONIA field (#326)
    o REST PAIN/GANGRENE (Y/N) field (#330)
    o CHEMOTHERAPY IN LAST 30 DAYS field (#338.1)

   transmit "A" to CICSP for new raw value of this answer option.
  
 - This patch modifies all Lab fields under the Laboratory Test Results
   (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC] option to assume a past date if the user
   enters a date without a year.
  
 - Reinstitute the default functionality of the CARDIAC SURG PERFORMED 
   NON-VA field (#472) in the SURGERY file (#130), so that it defaults to

      field (#469) should not be answered "NO, began off/stayed off".
  
  
 General Surgery Items
 ---------------------
 - Remedy Ticket #HD0000000152814
   This patch addresses two issues related to the Update Assessment Status
   to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option missing items list:
   (1) For the NUM OF PRIOR HEART SURGERIES field (#352) in the SURGERY
       file (#130), the field is corrected to display "Number of Prior
       Heart Surgeries" instead of "Prior Heart Surgery (Y/N)".
   (2) For the PRIOR HEART SURGERIES field (#485) in the SURGERY 
       file (#130), the data input functionality is modified to use the
       same controlled data input functionality used by the Clinical
       Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION] option. 
  
 - Remedy Ticket #HD0000000177807
   After installing this patch, if procedure and diagnosis coding is not
   complete at the time the Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA
   COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option is run, the software will display "The
   coding for Procedure and Diagnosis is not complete" immediately before
   asking, "Are you sure you want to complete this assessment ?".
  
 - Remedy Ticket #HD0000000185045
   When using the Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] 
   option to edit the OPERATIVE DEATH field (#384), entering YES or NO 
   causes the NEW MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY field (#467) to be changed to the 
   same value. Editing the NEW MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY field (#467) field 
   does not change the OPERATIVE DEATH field (#384).
  
 - Short LOCK Timeouts
   This patch updates the 1 second LOCK timeouts in the routine SROUTL to 
   use the VA FileMan variable DILOCKTM if it exists.
