  - Routine

Description: 
============

   ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE *************************** 
   
   This patch ONLY applies to DSS sites that have installed DSS 
   EXTRACTS V3.0 (dated DEC 22,1997 on the second line of routines).  
    
   ****************************************************************
   
   
   This patch to DSS EXTRACTS v3.0 addresses code modifications in
   several routines to ensure full compliance with VistA Y2K 
   renovation policy.
   
   The following DSS Extracts options are affected:
   
   Purge Data from Extract Files                 [ECXPURG]
   Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print              [ECXSCLIST]
   Transmit Data from Extract Files              [ECXTRANS]
   Active MAS Wards for Fiscal Year Print        [ECXWRD]
   
   The modifications were made so that the conversion of date/time data
   to external format is performed consistently, and the full 4-digit
   year is displayed.
   
   Patches XU*8*71 and DI*21*44 are both required for this patch.
   However, it has been noted at some facilities that the "DI" 
   namespace is not unique in the PACKAGE file (#9.4), and 
   consequently, the KIDS Required Build check may fail.  For 
   that reason, this patch will return only a Warning if the KIDS
   Build check fails.  This does NOT necessarily mean that patch
   DI*21*44 isn't there.  If you have confirmed that patch 
   DI*21*44 has been installed at your site, you may proceed with
   the installation of this patch without further concern.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
   
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  IRM should check
   with the DSS Site Manager (or check the list of queued background jobs
   in TaskManager) to be sure that DSS Extract transmission jobs have not
   been queued to run while this installation is taking place.
   
   Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
       from the mapped set at this time.
    
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ECX*3.0*2):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
    
   5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ECX*3.0*2.
   
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options
       you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
       
          Purge Data from Extract Files           [ECXPURG]
          Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print        [ECXSCLIST]
          Transmit Data from Extract Files        [ECXTRANS]
          Active MAS Wards for Fiscal Year Print  [ECXWRD]
    
   7.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
       to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
