 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. TOM-1203-41844     Can delete authorzations w/payments
    
    Problem:
    -------
    While editing a Fee Basis Authorization with no specified 
    VENDOR, from the Enter Authorization [FBAA ENTER AUTHORIZATION] 
    option, the user enters an "@" at the "Select FROM DATE:" prompt 
    to cancel the authorization, and is allowed to do so when there 
    are payments associated to the Authorization. The response 
    should be: "Cannot delete Authorization because payments already 
    exist!" When the process checks for payments, it first looks for 
    the vendor, then the payment to that vendor. Since no vendor was 
    specified in the Authorization, no payment is found and the 
    cancel authorization is allowed.
    
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The process was changed to look through the Fee Basis Payment 
    (#162) file record for a payment associated to the Authorization 
    using the internal entry number (ien) of the Authorization, 
    instead of looking for a payment made to the vendor in the 
    Authorization.
