Description: 
============

 
 *** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new GUI executable file.
          Installation of this new GUI is REQUIRED in order for the patch
          to function.  The new GUI MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after
          the KIDS install in order for the software to function. ***
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
 
 1. Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) will provide a visual
 indicator on the Virtual Due List (VDL) to identify which schedule types
 have active orders within the specified start and stop date/time for the
 selected Medication Tab. A green "alert light" to the left of the
 Schedule Type indicates that it has active orders for the specified
 timeframe, and a gray "alert light" to the left of the Schedule Type
 indicates that it has no active orders for the specified timeframe.
  
 2. PRN medications will display on the VDL if the PRN Schedule Types
 check box is selected in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. All
 other schedule types will remain selected on the VDL by default when the
 user opens a patient's record.
  
 3. The VDL will display a BCMA Clinical Reminders marquee at the lower 
 right hand corner. The "count" is the number of PRN medications 
 without Effectiveness comments within the hours defined in the 
 PRN Documentation label on the Parameters Tab of the GUI BCMA Site 
 Parameters application or within the current admission whichever is greater. 
 A mouse-over list displays the last four undocumented PRN orders. 
 When the user double clicks anywhere on the PRN Effectiveness row of 
 the BCMA Clinical Reminders marquee, the PRN Effectiveness Log dialog box 
 displays all PRN orders that need PRN Effectiveness and allowing 
 documentation of PRN Effectiveness comments for each order listed. 
 
 The "count" will update/refresh when the user:
 a) opens a patient file.
 b) administers a PRN medication order.
 c) completes the documentation of a PRN Effectiveness.
 d) refreshes the VDL.
 
 A Med History button has been added to display the Medication 
 Administration History for the order selected.
  
 4. When administering a PRN medication, the Units Given column
 within the Last Four Actions table and a drop down box for the users to
 select the PRN Reason have been added to the Medication Log dialog box.
 Units given will not display for orders with multiple dispensed drugs.
  
 5. An updated PRN Effectiveness Log dialog will ease the process of
 PRN Effectiveness documentation. It displays a list of undocumented PRN
 medications for a specific order, or across orders, including PRN 
 medications from previous or expired orders. The dialog box
 includes a Units Given column, which will not display units for orders 
 with multiple dispensed drugs. The Division column has been removed.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions: 
 ====================================
 Sites can retrieve VISTA documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
      available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
   specific server as follows:
  
  OI FIELD OFFICE  FTP ADDRESS               DIRECTORY
  
  Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  anonymous.software
  Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
