Subject: 'no msg receipt authorization' error

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This MailMan patch is in response to a problem noted on FORUM.
   
  A description of the problem:
  Site A (from outside the VA) sends a message to Site B (in the VA).
  User at Site B forwards the message to Site C (in the VA).
  Site C has records in ^XMBX(4.501 (do not accept messages from domains
  which match).
  Site C rejects the message because the originating domain (Site A)
  partial-matches the 'do not accept' record.
  MailMan sends a message to Site A about the rejection.
  MailMan keeps trying to forward the message from Site B to Site C
  and keeps sending rejection messages to Site A, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.
  MailMan does not notify the user at Site B who forwarded the message.
   
  This patch does two things:
  1. Sends the reject message to the user who forwarded the message.
  2. Changes the status of the message so that MailMan does not attempt to
  send it again.
  ===========================================================================
   
   This patch can be installed with users on the system.
  ===========================================================================
   
  INSTALLATION:
    1.  This routine is usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
        so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routine.
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s)
    5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
        other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
    6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
