Subject: VERSION 3.06 CHANGES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is an informational patch notifying the sites of new and updated
 functionality contained in the V3.06 release of the Voluntary Service System
 (VSS) software.  An addendum to the Voluntary Service System (VSS) User Manual
 is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the IO Field
 Offices.
 
 
 =========================
 NEW/CHANGED FUNCTIONALITY
 =========================
 
 A new menu has been created called the Awards Menu that contains the options
 for Awards Management.  The options added to the menu are:
 
     Awards Coding
     Awards Processed Report
     Potential Awards Report
 
 The following is a list of the changes found in version 3.06.  Sites should
 run the options in the following order: first the Potential Awards Report to
 identify the volunteers eligible for an award; next the Awards Coding to
 actually code the awards identified by the Potential Awards Report; and
 finally the Awards Processed Report to show the volunteers that actually
 received an award (had an award coded in VSS).
 
 Potential Awards Report
 -----------------------
 Before a site processes their awards, they should run the Potential Awards
 Report.  This report will show all volunteers that are eligible for an award. 
 Version 3.06 fixes the following problems with the report:
 
     Adults and Youths will no longer print on the same report
     The organization name will no longer double print
     The last volunteer name will no longer be dropped from each page
 
 This report has also been changed in version 3.06 to include the following
 enhancements:
 
     Ability to print mailing labels
     Moving Hours and Years award to the end of the report
     Changing the date of award to the last day of the month versus the first
 
 Sites can choose to print labels from both the Potential Awards Report and the
 Awards Processed Report.  If a site chooses to print the labels from the
 Potential Awards Report, the labels will be printed prior to the award being
 processed in VSS (using the Award Coding option).  This also means that labels
 for the Hours and Years Award are also printed.  If a site chooses to print
 the labels from the Awards Processed Report, the labels will be printed after
 the award is processed in VSS.  You cannot print the Hours and Years Award
 labels from the Awards Processed Report since this award is not processed in
 VSS.  Once awards have been processed in VSS, they will be removed from the
 Potential Awards Report and will show up under the Awards Processed Report.
 
 Award Processed Report
 ----------------------
 The Awards Processed Report shows all awards coded within a date range.  If
 you select to code the awards on 9/30/03, you can run the Awards Processed
 Report for this date and see all the awards processed.  Version 3.06 fixes the
 problem with the sorting of the volunteer name on this report.  The volunteers
 are now sorted by last name.
 
 Awards Coding
 -------------
 Be careful when using this option.  Once awards are processed they cannot be
 reversed.
 
 The Awards Coding option is the option to use to quickly process the awards
 for volunteers.  The same volunteers listed in the Potential Awards Report
 will appear on this option with the exception of the Hours and Years Award. 
 The Hours and Years Award is not processed in VSS.  Make sure the input
 parameters are equal to those used on the Potential Awards Report, especially
 the Date of Award.
 
 Version 3.06 fixes the following problems with the Awards Coding option:
 
     All object reference errors are resolved
     Adults and youths are no longer displayed in the same award 
     The Awards Coding list and the Potential Awards Report will display the
         same data
 
 This option has also been changed in version 3.06 to include the following
 enhancements:
 
     Name changed from Awards Management to Awards Coding
     Changing the date of award to the last day of the month versus the first
     Adding the input parameters on the Awards Coding screen
     Adding post and exit buttons to both the top and bottom of the screen
 
 Manual Coding of Awards
 -----------------------
 A site may choose to manual code an award in VSS.  This can be done using the
 Station Profile option under Edit Volunteer (under the Volunteer Records
 Menu).  Version 3.06 fixes the problem where an award could be coded with no
 award date; or, an award date could be entered with no award code.  This
 caused problems on the Potential Awards Report where a volunteer would show up
 with an award date and no award code.  These volunteers may still show up on
 the report in version 3.06.  Sites can fix these by manual processing an award
 or by processing the award using the Award Coding option.  Once an award is
 processed for the volunteer using version 3.06, this problem will disappear.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following functionality describes other changes to version 3.06 that is
 independent of awards.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Volunteers By Organization VS26 Report
 --------------------------------------
 The Volunteer By Organization VS26 Report has been fixed to correctly show the
 number of visits.  In order to see the count of visits, you must select Show
 Visits prior to hitting the Display button on the report interface.
 
 An enhancement to this report removes the age of the volunteer and replaces it
 with Youth or Adult.
 
 Printing Meal Tickets
 ---------------------
 There was a problem with the pause prior to printing the meal ticket.  This
 has been corrected in version 3.06.
 
 Object Reference Errors
 -----------------------
 All object reference errors in VSS have been fixed in version 3.06.  Sites
 should no longer see this error occur.
 
 Rollback Transaction Errors
 ---------------------------
 The Rollback Transaction Errors in VSS have been fixed in version 3.06.  Sites
 should no longer see this error occur.

 RETRIEVAL OF USER MANUAL
 ========================
 The preferred method is to FTP the file from DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV, which
 will transmit the file from the first available server.  Alternatively, site
 may elect to retrieve the file from a specific OI Field Office.  The
 documentation can be read via the Adobe Acrobat Reader browser program. The
 .PDF file is a binary file and must be
 transferred using binary file transfer tools.
