Subject: Erroneous alert recipients

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch addresses two problems reported with alerts sent by the 
 Consult/Request Tracking software.
  
 Problem 1
 When processing some Consult alerts, an undefined variable XQAID can 
 occur. This problem happens sporadically at the reporting site and has 
 not been reproduced. The fix provided in this patch has been tested at 
 the reporting site and has corrected the problem. 
  
 Problem 2
 Erroneous alerts may be sent to users if an ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE USER or 
 ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE TEAM, within the multiple fields in the REQUEST 
 SERVICES (#123.5) file, is over-written with another user or team instead 
 of deleting and entering the new team or user. A faulty cross-reference 
 was remaining and caused the package to identify the over-written entry 
 as a notification recipient.
