Subject: ADDING STAT/NOW MAIL PARAMETER

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 **NOTE**
    There is an associated Inpatient Medications v5.0 patch, PSJ*5*154,
    that will require this patch.  The inpatient patch will include the
    code that will allow the functionality of this data dictionary to work.
    This patch only installs the data dictionary.
 *******
  
     PSI-05-051:  A priority status of ASAP is not easily seen by the 
     finishing pharmacist.  A STAT order is displayed as blinking and 
     highlighted, but a ASAP order does not have any special visual
     effects.  
  
     In order to avoid adding more special visual effects to the screen 
     this patch is designed to provide two System Parameters that will
     allow the site a choice of what orders are sent to the PSJ STAT 
     NOW ACTIVE ORDER and PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER mail groups.
     The site can select STAT, ASAP, or NOW orders, or any combination of 
     the three for notification via the mail group functionality.
  
     This patch is adding two additional fields (parameters) to 
     PHARMACY SYSTEM FILE (#59.7), to enable the sites to select the
     priorities that will be used in the Inpatient Medications v5.0 
     PENDING and ACTIVE order notification software.  This will solve the
     reported problem in HD98412 / PSI-05-051 by enabling the site to be
     notified when ASAP orders are submitted by the physician.
