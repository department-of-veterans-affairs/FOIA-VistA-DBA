 The following NOIS calls have been resolved by this patch:
 
 NOIS MEM-0302-70410 "MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS WITH EDIT REPORT"
 NOIS MEM-0402-73178 "PCE CODE ERROR"
 
 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
 
  1) The following new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY package:
 
     a) COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1 (160,25) 
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #2 (160,25.1)
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #3 (160,25.2)
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #4 (160,25.3)
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #5 (160,25.4)
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #6 (160,25.5)
 
        COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION #1-6 record the patient's pre-existing
        conditions and/or complications using ICD-9-CM codes.  If no 
        comorbid conditions or complications were documented, these items 
        should be left blank.  These fields are part of the general patient
        data and are accessible via the [AI Complete Abstract] option.    
 
     b) PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER (165.5,148)
        CANCER #1                  (165.5,148.1) 
        CANCER #2                  (165.5,148.2)
        CANCER #3                  (165.5,148.3)
        CANCER #4                  (165.5,148.4)
 
        PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER records whether the patient has a 
        history of any reportable prior malignancy.  Acceptable values are
        "Yes", "No" or "Unknown".
 
        If PREVIOUS HISTORY OF CANCER = "Yes", CANCER #1-4 record up to 4
        instances of cancer.  The registrar may select from the SITE-GROUP 
        FOR ONCOLOGY (164.2) file in response to the CANCER #1-4 prompts.
        These fields are part of the Patient Identification portion of the 
        abstract.
     
     c) AFIP SUBMISSION (165.5,83)
 
        AFIP SUBMISSION records whether the pathology was sent to the Armed
        Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) for a second opinion.  
        Acceptable values are "Yes", "No" or "Unknown".  This field is part
        of the "Cancer Identification" portion of the abstract.
 
     d) FAMILY HISTORY OF CANCER (160,43)
 
        For the sake of consistency the FAMILIY HISTORY OF CANCER codes have
        been changed:
 
        Old codes: Y (Yes), N (No), U (Unknown)
        New codes: 1 (Yes), 0 (No), 9 (Unknown)
 
        The existing data values have been appropriately converted to the 
        new codes.
 
     These items have been added to the VACCR EXTRACT V9.1 Record Layout at 
     the following column positions.
 
                                  Column #
                                  ---------
     Family Hx of Ca--Text        1035-1084
     AFIP Submission              1363-1363
     Personal Hx of Ca--Text      1364-1383
     Personal History of Ca       1385-1385
                         
  2) 2001 LUNG PCE NAVIGATION
 
     When the user selected the 2001 Lung PCE menu item 8 (All) AND the 
     patient had no chemotherapy, the program would skip items 26-27 and
     return to the PCE menu.  This was incorrect.  The program should skip
     items 26-27 and continue on to item 28.  This has been fixed.
 
  3) RETINOBLASTOMA PRIMARY TUMOR (T) CODE SUFFIXES
 
     RETINOBLASTOMA cases may have a Primary Tumor (T) code suffix of "f" 
     (family history) or "d" (diffuse retinal involvement).  The prompting
     for these suffixes was tied to an ICDO-TOPOGRAPHY (165.5,20) value of
     C69.2 (Retina).  This was incorrect.  "f" and "d" suffix prompting
     should be tied to an histology value of RETINOBLASTOMA.  This has been
     fixed.
    
  4) 5TH EDITION DISTANT METASTASIS (M) CODING FOR VULVA (C51._)
 
     When attempting to enter a 5th edition CLINCAL M (165.5,37.3) or 
     PATHOLOGIC M (165.5,87) value for a VULVA (C51._) case the user
     encountered a "Code input not valid for this site" error message.
     This was incorrect.  M coding for VULVA is valid.  This has been fixed.
 
  5) NAACCR EXTRACT MODIFICATIONS
 
     a) Morph--Type&Behav ICD-O-2 [419] 232-236  
 
     For 2001 or late cases the NAACCR item "Morph--Type&Behav ICD-O-2" will 
     now be left blank.
  
     b) Reporting Hospital       [540]  271-285
        Last Follow-Up Hospital [2430] 1813-1827
        Following Registry      [2440] 1828-1842
 
     The above NAACCR items were not being exported correctly.  The 6-digit
     internal value should be prefixed by "6" and suffixed by "0".  This has
     been fixed.
 
     c) Date of 1st Contact [580] 300-307
 
     The above NAACCR item was not being exported correctly.  The exported 
     value was being derived from the DATE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION (165.5,1)
     field.  It should be derived from the DATE DX (165.5,3) field.  This has
     been fixed.
 
     d) Coding System for EOD [870] 421-421
 
     The above NAACCR item was not being exported correctly.  We were 
     exporting a value of 1 (2-Digit Site-Specific Extent of Disease
     (1973-82)).  The correct value is 4 (10-Digit Extent of Disease,
     1988 (1988+)).  This has been fixed.
 
     e) Date Case Last Changed [2100] 960-967 
     
     The NAACCR item "Date Case Last Changed" was being left blank.  It will 
     now contain the date on which the extract was created.
  
     f) Name--Last [2230] 1526-1550
 
     The NAACCR extract logic for "Name--Last" has been modified to remove 
     any embedded spaces or special characters with the exception of "-" 
     (hyphen).
 
     e.g. VAN BUREN will now be exported as VANBUREN
          VAN-BUREN will continue to be exported as VAN-BUREN
 
  6) SCREENING OR BIOPSY PROCEDURES
 
     The SCREENING OR BIOPSY PROCEDURES fields for breast and prostate cases
     were being prompted for all CLASS OF CASE values.  This was incorrect.
     For CLASS OF CASE values 5 (Dx at autopsy) and 8 (Dx by death cert 
     only), the SCREENING OR BIOPSY PROCEDURES fields should be stuffed with
     9s.  This has been fixed.
    
  7) PATIENT CARE EVALUATION STUDY OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CARCINOMA
     Item 12: Distance in Millimeters to Closest Margin
 
     For the PROXIMAL MARGIN and DISTAL MARGIN items code 998 was not being
     resolved to mean "NA, no surgery of primary site" when displayed.
     This has been fixed.
 
  8) [SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...]
       [CF Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search]
 
     The following modifications to lab casefinding have been made:
 
     a) REFRACTORY ANEMIA
 
     Lab Casefinding was not finding refractory anemia cases.  This was due 
     to the fact that the MORPHOLOGY FIELD (61.1) file does not contain the
     refractory anemia morphology codes.  The lab package records refractory
     anemia cases via the DISEASE FIELD (64.1) SNOMED codes 4006 and 
     4079-4084.
 
     We have expanded the lab casefinding search to include a search of the
     DISEASE field for these SNOMED DISEASE codes.
 
     b) AUTOPSY CASES
 
     At a multidivisional facility the Lab Casefinding was finding autopsy 
     cases for the wrong division.  e.g.  Albany Lab Casefinding was finding
     cases for Syracuse.  This has been fixed.
 
     c) MULTIPLE CASEFINDINGS FOR A SINGLE PATIENT
 
     If Lab Casefinding found more than one finding for the same patient for
     the time period specified, the program would add the most recent 
     finding to suspense.  This was incorrect.  The oldest or earliest finding
     should be added to suspense.
    
     e.g. If a patient had CYTOLOGY data for ADENOCARCINOMA of the LIVER on
     2/12/02 and SURGICAL PATHOLOGY data for ADENOCARCINOMA of the ESOPHAGUS 
     on 2/15/02, the correct data to add to suspense is the earlier finding
     on 2/12/02.
 
     This has been fixed.
 
  9) Non-prostate PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION (165.5,30.1)
 
     PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION is for prostate cases only.  This patch will set 
     the PATHOLOGIC EXTENSION value for all non-prostate cases to null (blank).
 
 10) KAPOSI'S SARCOMA WARNING
 
     All KAPOSI'S SARCOMA (9140/3) cases were generating the following
     interfield edit warning:
 
     WARNING: No TNM classification is available for KAPOSI'S SAROMA
              SUMMARY STAGE cannot be blank
 
     This was occurring even when SUMMARY STAGE had been filled in.
     This has been fixed.
 
 11) NOIS MEM-0402-73178 "PCE CODE ERROR"
     2001 Lung (NSCLC) PCE Study
     Item 4: Symptoms Present at Initial Diagnosis
     
     Field LNG PALPABLE LYMPH NODES (165.5,1404.4) contained an incorrect 
     code 3 (Not documented if present).  The correct code for this value is 9.
     This has been fixed.  We will search for any "3" values in this field 
     and change them to "9".
 
 12) HISTOLOGY ICD-O-3 display
 
     The following report options have been updated to include the display
     of HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) (165.5,22.3) data:
 
     On the [LIS *..Registry Lists] Menu:
  
     [PA Patient Index-ACOS (132c)]
     [IW Primary ICDO Listing (132c)]
 
     On the [ANN *..Annual Reports] Menu:
 
     [API Annual ACOS Patient Index (132c)]
     [ASL Annual Primary Site/GP Listing (132c)]
 
 13) SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY   (165.5,138)
     SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURG DATE (165.5,138.2)
     NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED       (165.5,140)
 
     a) For unknown, leukemia, lymphoma, or brain primaries, the SCOPE OF 
        LYMPH NODE SURG DATE was being stuffed with 99/99/9999.  This has
        been changed.  SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURG DATE will now be stuffed
        with 00/00/0000.
 
     b) For unknown, leukemia, lymphoma, or brain primaries which have NO
        TREATMENT, the above fields were being stuffed as follows:
 
        SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY...: No regional lymph nodes removed
        SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURG DATE.: 00/00/0000
        NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED.......: No nodes removed
 
        This was incorrect.  These fields will now be stuffed as follows:
 
        SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURGERY...: Unknown; not stated; death 
                                        certificate ONLY
        SCOPE OF LYMPH NODE SURG DATE.: 00/00/0000
        NUMBER OF NODES REMOVED.......: Unknown, not stated, death cert ONLY
