 PATCH RETRIEVAL
 =============== 
 CMOP sites will need to only use the installation instructions in 
 patch PSS*1*100.  The  patches for this installation are combined in host
 file PSJ_OR_PSS_UNITS.KID in order to simplify installation at Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Installation of this host file
 should be coordinated among the packages affected since only one
 installation is necessary. The patches are:
  
  OR*3*237       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
  PSJ*5*152      INPATIENT MEDICATIONS
  PSS*1*100      PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
 specific server as follows:
  
  Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
  Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
  Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
