Subject: QUANTITY CHANGING AND WRONG DRUG NAME CARRYS OVER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the displaying of the incorrect quantity, drug
 name and orderable item name.
  
 1. TNV-0904-31917
 ==========================
  
 When using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] 
 option, two recently ordered drugs are chosen for a single patient.  When
 editing the first drug, the schedule and quantity are changed. After
 accepting these changes, the next drug is brought up. If you only change
 the schedule for this prescription, the quantity is reset to the first
 prescription's quantity.
  
 This patch will resolve this issue by displaying the correct quantity for
 the second drug chosen.
  
 2. LEX-1104-40819
 ==========================
  
 When using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] 
 option a discontinued and an active drug are chosen for a patient.
 The first drug is re-instated from a discontinued state and the second
 drug is then edited for the dosage.  After inputting the dosage text or
 amount, the drug name and orderable item name from the first drug is
 incorrectly displayed into the fields for the second drug.
  
 Another issue is when 1 active med is chosen for a patient. When the user 
 edits the Orderable Item name or Drug name, and changes the name to a new 
 med name, the new name would not show.  Instead the old name re-appears. 
  
 This patch will resolve this issue by displaying the correct drug name and
 orderable item name for the second drug chosen (first issue above).  
 Also, this patch will resolve the issue by displaying the correct drug 
 name and orderable item name for the active drug (second issue above).

  ==========================
  It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business
  hours while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are using the system.
  
   Installation will take about 5 minutes.  
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
   2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should 
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.

      the Installation menu.  
  
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*194)
     a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
            the components of the KIDS build.
        c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*194.
  
   6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
