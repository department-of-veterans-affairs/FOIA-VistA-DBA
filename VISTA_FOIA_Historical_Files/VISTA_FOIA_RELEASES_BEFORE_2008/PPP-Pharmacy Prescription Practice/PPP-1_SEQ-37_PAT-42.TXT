Subject: SCHEDULING REPLACEMENT API

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Scheduling V. 5.3 package is moving the patient appointment information
 stored in the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2) and the
 APPOINTMENT sub-file  (#44.001) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) to the
 Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS) database. Eventually, these sub-files will
 be deleted from the Scheduling files. As part of the Scheduling Replacement
 Project, Scheduling V. 5.3 package is providing a series of Application
 Programmer Interface calls (APIs) that will be used to get the patient
 appointment information from the new GOTS database. This patch replaces all
 direct references to the patient appointment information in the Print 
 Clinic Medication Profile [PPP PRINT CLINIC PROFILES] option, with the new
 APIs.
