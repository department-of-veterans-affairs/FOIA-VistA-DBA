Description: 
============

   Required Builds:  Master Patient Index Vista 1.0 - This is a controlled 
   release.  If you have not installed this package and are not on the 
   installation schedule for CIRN 1.0 and MPI 1.0, contact your VISN
   Implementation Manager for CIRN.
  
   ISSUE 1:  Correct a typo in the label to display of Mother's Maiden Name
   in the Display Only Query.  NVS staff also requested that Mother's
   Maiden Name only be displayed if there is an actual value.  Date of
   Death is not being displayed in external format, this will be corrected
   by this patch. MPIFSAQ contains this change.
  
   ISSUE 2:  When using the Display Only Query it is possible to see a 
   patient listed multiple times with the same CMOR and different treating
   facilities but the same ICN.  This has been corrected.  The user will
   see each ICN only once with all the treating facilities known listed
   with that entry.  This fix is contained in MPIFSAQ.
  
   ISSUE 3:  When using the Single Patient Initialization option, it is
   possible for the same situation to occur as in issue 2.  This has been
   corrected in routine MPIFQ0.
  
   ISSUE 4:  The MPIF EXCEPTION mail group description has been updated
   due to some confusion as to what this group is for and if NOISes would
   be generated from messages generated to this mail group.
  
   ISSUE 5:  When using the Single Patient Initialization option or the
   Inactivate Patient from MPI option, the display when the patient has
   been ZZ'd or has 5 leading 0s for the SSN said 'Patient has Test SSN'.
   This display has been enhanced to 'Patient should not be sent to the
   MPI -- SSN has 5 leading 0s or name has been ZZ'd'. This fix is 
   contained in MPIFQ0

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
  
    This patch should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
    disruption to the users.   Especially since this impacts the DG options
    as well as MPIF options.
   
    This patch will take less than 5 minutes to install.
   
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package MPIF*1*13.
   
    8.  When prompted for Coordinator of the MPIF Exceptions mail group,
        enter the IRM person who would be contacted for problems at the
        site with HL7.  This mail group already exists, but KIDS prompts
        for the coordinator.
  
    9.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        YES//', respond No
        When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes:
  
         [MPIF PAT INACT]          Inactivate Patient from MPI
         [MPIF IND MPI LOAD]       Single Patient Initialization to MPI
         [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI]       Display Only Query
  
         [DGRPT 10-10T REGISTRATION]     10-10T Registration
         [DG REGISTER PATIENT]           Register a Patient
         [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]           Load/Edit Patient Data
   
  
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
