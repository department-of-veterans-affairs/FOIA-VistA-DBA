Description:
============

  Phase I of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus
  Group Initial Requirements Analysis (IRA) project consists of four
  patches. The patches are combined in host file PSJ_PSS_OR_PSU_110.KID in
  order to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
  facilities. Installation of this host file should be coordinated among
  the four packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The
  patches, in order of install, are:
  
       PSS*1*79   PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
       PSJ*5*110  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
       OR*3*213   ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING V. 1.0
       PSU*3*34   PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT V. 3.0
  
  Patches PSS*1*79, OR*3*213, and PSU*3*34 contain changes to support the
  following enhancements in PSJ*5*110:
  
  1. The Extend Stop Date on Renewal enhancements will allow an order to be
  renewed without creating a new order. Editing of the start date will no
  longer be allowed during the renewal process. In addition, limits have
  been set on the length of time after an order expires that it may be 
  renewed. This is outlined in the Bar Code Medication Administration
  (BCMA) 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #11.
  
  2. The Complex Order enhancements will change the way complex orders are
  handled by linking complex components (child orders) together. If the
  actions Finish, Verify, Discontinue, or Renew are taken on one child
  order, the user will be alerted that the action must be taken on all of
  the complex component orders in the set. The user will then be prompted
  to take the appropriate action on each child order in the complex order
  set. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #8.
  
  3. The STAT and NOW Order Notification enhancements will alert users
  subscribing to new mail group PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER when a pending
  STAT or NOW order has been received from Computerized Patient Record
  System (CPRS) V. 1.0. Users subscribing to the new mail group PSJ STAT
  NOW ACTIVE ORDER will receive an alert when a STAT or NOW order is made
  active. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement
  #12.
  
  In order to support the Extend Stop Date for Renewals changes, new fields
  will be created in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and the PHARMACY 
  SYSTEM file (#59.7).
  
  1. The PREVIOUS ORDERS FILE ENTRY sub-field (#4) will be added to the
  LAST RENEW multiple (#114) in the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the
  PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
  
  2. The PREVIOUS ORDERS FILE ENTRY sub-field (#4) will be added to the
  LAST RENEW multiple (#138) in the IV multiple (#100) in the PHARMACY
  PATIENT file (#55).
  
  3. The EXPIRED IV TIME LIMIT field (#34) will be added to the PHARMACY 
  SYSTEM file (#59.7).
  
  4. In support of Complex Orders changes, a new cross-reference will be 
  created to group complex child orders by their parent order. For Unit 
  Dose orders, the cross-reference will be indexed by the ORDERS FILE 
  PARENT ORDER field (#125), the ORDERS FILE ENTRY field (#66), and the
  Unit Dose order number appended with "U". For IV orders, the cross-
  reference will be indexed by the ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER field (#150),
  the ORDERS FILE ENTRY field (#110), and the IV order number appended with
  "V". The cross-reference definition will be created by the pre-install
  routine PSSCMPLX. These are the new cross-references added to the
  PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and the fields used as the trigger-points.
  The type of these cross-references is "New", not "Traditional".
