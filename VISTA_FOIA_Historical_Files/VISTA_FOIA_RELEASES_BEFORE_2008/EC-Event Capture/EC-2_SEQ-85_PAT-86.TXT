Subject: EVENT CAPTURE ROLL-N-SCROLL SHUTDOWN

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Event Capture System (ECS) front-end currently has two user interfaces, 
 commonly known as the Roll-and-Scroll, a character user interface (CHUI), and 
 a Graphical User Interface (GUI) a more modern, user friendly interface. 
 With the release of patch EC*2.0*84, System Development Support (SDS) has 
 successfully enhanced the GUI version, making it functionally equivalent in 
 capability as the Roll-and-Scroll version.
 
 The Bedford DSO has requested the shut down of the ECS Roll-and-Scroll and
 has issued guidance to the field that all users should be using the GUI
 version of the Event Capture System.
   
   
 Technical
 ---------
 This patch will disable all Event Capture Roll-and-Scroll menu options. The
 following main menus and their sub-menus were placed out of order.
  
      Event Capture Menu [ECMENU] 
        Event Capture Management Menu ... [ECMGR]
        Event Capture Data Entry ... [ECENTER]
        Event Capture Reports ... [ECREPS]
        Event Capture Online Documentation [ECDSONL]
 
 
 Functional
 ----------
 When a user tries to access any of the Event Capture Roll-and-Scroll options,
 they will see a message similar to one of the following:
 
   Select Core Applications Option: ^event capture
    
       1    Event Capture Data Entry  [ECENTER]
       2    Event Capture Reports  [ECREPS]
  
   Type '^' to stop, or choose a number from 1 to 2 :1 Event Capture Data Entry

 Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or Event Capture
 ADPAC.
  
  This message details the national VistA options that were disabled under
  the Event Capture System (ECS) roll-and-scroll interface. If an option was
  not found, then it will be identified in a section of this email message.
  Additionally, any pre-released EC2P* options will be disabled and listed.
    
  If your site has edited the name of a national option, then your IRM will
  need to manually disable any such option.
