Subject: SC/MST EF BLOCK PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 When AICS is used for checkout on patients who are being treated for a
 Service Connected (SC) condition and have reported Military Sexual Trauma
 (MST), the encounter STATUS results in ACTION REQUIRED.  Both the SC/MST
 CLASSIFICATION and HIDDEN CLASSIFICATN (V3.0 MST) blocks ask the
 appropriate SC question but if answered 'YES', the MST question is not
 presented.  After the installation of this patch, if the SC question is
 answered 'YES' and the patient is reported to have MST answered 'YES' in the
 MST package, then MST is presented during AICS Manual Data Entry.
