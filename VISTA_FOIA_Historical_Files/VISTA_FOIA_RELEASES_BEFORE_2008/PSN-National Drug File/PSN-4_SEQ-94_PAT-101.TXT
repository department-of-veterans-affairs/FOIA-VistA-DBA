Description:
============

 
 This patch does not affect any Pharmacy functionality or end-users.
 This patch requires the HEALTH DATA & INFORMATICS (HDI) 1.0 package in
 addition to required patch release checks.
  
 The scope of Data Standardization - Pharmacy enhancement project is to
 modify the VISTA Pharmacy National Drug File (NDF) structures in order to
 meet the established standards for elements required by Data Standardization
 to implement a common set of standards for Clinical Health Data Repository
 (CHDR) and the Health Data Repository (HDR).
 To accomplish data standardization with VISTA Pharmacy and data flow to CHDR
 and HDR a Veterans Health Administration Unique Identifier (VUID) and the
 TERMSTATUS subscript Effective Date/Status will be populated in four files
 within the VISTA Pharmacy National Drug File package. VUID numbers will be
 generated dynamically and programmatically for each product. The VUID
 numbers have been assigned to National Drug File with a predetermined range
 (4000624- 4500623). There will be a one time conversion to update the
 National Drug File package files. Once the Application Patch (PSN*4*101) and
 the VUID data have been installed in the four Globals for the Data Domain
 (NDF), the Application Post-install routine calls an API in the HDI package
 to update the VUID Seeding Process as Complete.
  
 This KIDS Build will only install ONCE in a Production UCI.
  
 Sites with Class III BCMA software must test their functionality PRIOR
 to installing this patch. Data Standardization DOES NOT check against
 Class III contingency plan.
  
 The four VISTA Pharmacy files being "standardized" are: 
  
    VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
    DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416)
    VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605)
    VA GENERIC file (#50.6)
