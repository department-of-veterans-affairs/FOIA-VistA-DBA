Category:

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a problem in which abnormal Lab results did not get

 when LR*5.2*348 was installed.

 PROBLEM:
 ========
 Patch LR*5.2*340 was release to address a problem with the display of 
 non-verified lab test results. Invalid code was introduced causing
 intermittent display errors. LR*5.2*348 was released to fix this
 display issue. Not known at the time was this code also was used to send 
 the abnormal test results to the Order file, resulting in the Order file
 not to be updated with the abnormal results.
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 This patch contains a Post-Install routine that will look through the Lab 
 Order Entry file (#69) to find Lab orders in the date range starting
 August 15,2005 when LR*5.2*340 was entered/installed into beta test to 
 the date when LR*5.2*348 was installed.
 From that it will access the Lab Date file to look for abnormal results.
 If found it will look at the corresponding Order file (#100) and if the
 results are not found there, then the Order file will be updated with
 the Abnormal results. An informational Mailman message will be sent to the
 installer of the patch with the Post-Install routine results. Following is
 an example:
