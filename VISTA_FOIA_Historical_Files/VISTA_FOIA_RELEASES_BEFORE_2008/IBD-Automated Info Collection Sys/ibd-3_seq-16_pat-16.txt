Subject: FORMS TRACKING MISC ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 The following is the list of changes contained in this patch:
  
 1. When a new clinic is created and appointments are made for that clinic,
    encounter forms print but appointment information does not display on
    the Form Tracking Status Report. It was noticed that this happened in
    single division facilities, where division was not specified for the new
    clinic. The data should list under a division heading of 'NOT SPECIFIED'.
    Routine IBDFFT1 has been changed to resolve this issue.
    (NOIS: BUT-0997-22357)
  
 2. When using action 'SS Status Select' within option 'Forms Tracking'
    [IBDF FORMS TRACKING], the data list for PENDING PAGES and ERROR
    DETECTED, NOT TRANSMITTED statuses does not list the correct data.  It
    lists all the items not printed. Routine IBDFSS has been changed to
    resolve this issue (NOIS: SUX-0997-42276).
  
    Additional items were fixed/changed while working to resolve the above
    issues.  When using action 'SS Status Select' within option 'Forms
    Tracking' [IBDF FORMS TRACKING], if a user selects 'ALL' at the
    'ENCOUNTER FORM STATUS' prompt the encounter forms associated
    with both cancelled and no show appointments were not being included
    on the list.  Also, entries listed with a status of AVAILABLE FOR DATA
    ENTRY (Avail De) on the Form Tracking Status Report were listed as 'Not
    Printed' (No Prt) on the Status Select Report. The status of 'No Prt'
    has been changed to 'Avl De' on the Status Select Report. A new status
    of AVAILABLE FOR DATA ENTRY(#20), has been added to the list of choices
    for the 'ENCOUNTER FORM STATUS' prompt. The Status of ERROR DETECTED, NOT
    TRANSMITTED has been changed from 'No Trans' on the Form Tracking Status
    Report to 'Er/Notrn'.  This status on the Status Select Report has been
    changed from 'No Trn' to 'Er/Ntr'.
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the following
 menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be disabled to prevent
 possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.  Other DHCP users will 
 not be affected.  
  
    Forms Tracking    [IBDF FORMS TRACKING]
  
 Installation time is approximately 5 minutes.
