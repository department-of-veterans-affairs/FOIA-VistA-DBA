Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The patch will resolve patient safety issue PSI-05-023.
  
  HD0000000086717 - Multiple active Orders Appearing in BCBU
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  A problem has been identified that will cause the BCMA Backup (BCBU)
  to contain multiple active orders for the same order.  This issue happens
  in the PSJ OE (Inpatient Medications) option.  After a pharmacist
  finishes and accepts a complex order, then edits and verifies each order
  in sequence, multiple HL7 records are sent to the BCBU signifying the
  order has been verified.  The BCBU should only receive 1 record
  signifying the order is verified.  This patch will modify this behavior
  by sending the HL7 records as "Pending" until all child orders are
  verified.  Then a final HL7 transaction will be sent telling the BCBU
  that the entire order has been verified.
