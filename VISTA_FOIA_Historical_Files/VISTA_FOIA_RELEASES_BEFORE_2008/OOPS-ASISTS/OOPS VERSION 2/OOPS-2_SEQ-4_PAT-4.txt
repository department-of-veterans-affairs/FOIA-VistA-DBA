Subject: OOPS*2*4 REPORTS AND OTHER NOIS FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide fixes and updates to the ASISTS GUI. 
 
 This patch contains a new GUI version, which needs to be installed by
 running the OOPS2_4.EXE file. Once the files have been installed they can be
 copied or moved to other locations without further requirement to run the 
 installation program. 
 
   
 This patch addresses the following E3Rs:
 ----------------------------------------
 16729 - In the Workers Compensation Bulletin the text has been changed from 
  
 "A copy of the CA1/CA2 must be printed out, hand-signed and dated, and 
 sent to the Worker's  Compensation Manager's office."  
  
 To:
  
 "The CA1/CA2 must be electronically signed by the employee and supervisor.  
 Then a copy of the CA1/CA2 must be printed out, hand-signed and dated in 
 blue ink, and sent to the Worker's Compensation Manager's office."
  
 16117 - In File (#2261.2) ASISTS CRITICAL TRACKING ISSUES added a new entry 
 Not Elsewhere Classified. A filter was added to the incident type of "Other" 
 to prevent it from being used in the future. 
  
 This patch addresses the following TAG requested Enhancements:
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Can now print the OSHA and Needlestick log even if there are no 
 reportable cases in the requested date range, it will print with zero totals.
  
 2. Can now print blank CA1's and CA2's.  There is a new menu option in the 
 GUI on the Workers Compensation menu, Print Blank CA1/CA2.
  
 3. Changed the name of the Print/Display CA1/CA2 option on all menu options 
 to Print CA1/CA2. It is also now possible to print the CA1 or CA2 from 
 the Complete/Validate/Sign CA1 (or CA2) option from the Supervisor and 
 Workers' Compensation menu.
  
 4. Changed the name of the Print Report of Accident option to Print Report 
 of Accident (2162) on all menu options.  It is also now possible to print 
 the Report of Accident from the Complete/Validate/Sign Accident 
 Report (2162) option (on the Supervisor, Safety and Workers' Comp menus) 
 or the Edit/Validate Stub Record (on the Employee 
 Health menu).
  
 5. Made the secondary supervisor a mandatory field if the individuals' 
 personnel status is employee, non-paid employee, or a volunteer.
  
 6. Added the ability to report open, closed, or both open and closed cases 
 from the Print Accident Report Status report from all menus.
  
 7. A new bulletin has been added, OOPS CASE CLOSE NOTIFICATION.  This 
 bulletin will be sent to the OOPS SAFETY and OOPS WCP mail groups whenever 
 a case is closed.  The case number, name of the user closing the case, and 
 the date the case was closed is included in the bulletin.
  
 8. Added the words 'or aggravated' to the question in block 12 of the CA2 
 so that the prompt now reads: Date you first realized the disease or 
 illness was caused or aggravated by your employment.
  
 9. Modified the Create Accident/Illness Report Option to allow entry of 
 the SSN, DOB, or Sex fields for an employee if any of those fields are 
 blank in the Employee Master File (PAID File #450) and cannot be 'pulled' 
 into the ASISTS case when first created.
  
 10. Added a 'Reporting Problems' menu option on the Help Menu on the Main 
 menu to provide instructions to the user to first call their IRM for 
 assistance, or if additional help is needed, the VHA Help Desk.
  
 11. Modified the Change Status of a Case option so that once a case has been 
 electronically transmitted to the Department of Labor, it cannot be 
 deleted.  Also, once a case status has been changed to deleted, the status 
 cannot be changed (the claim will not appear in the selection list).

 Overview of NOIS Message(s):
 ---------------------------- 
 NYH-1103-10994     Error in Sensitive Message/Question Faxed Cases
 MAN-1203-11338     OOPS SENSITIVE DATA BULLETIN
 HUN-1203-21811     SENSITIVE DATA BULLETIN
 LEX-1203-41817     Problem with sensitive data message
 TAM-0104-31182     Sensitive Data Message
 In certain circumstances, the ISO Sensitive Notification email was being
 created and sent with no Supervisor or Employee information. This occurred
 when a supervisor either tried to retrieve his own information, or the
 search returned no employees. The GUI has been fixed to make sure the
 bulletin is not sent if either piece of information is missing.
 
 HEH-1203-42342     Problem saving data
 If a Physician's data entry in the Site Parameter file does not contain a
 state, incorrect information is placed into the Zip code and Title
 fields, thus causing an error when the CA1 is saved. The code which
 retrieves the information from the Site Parameter file has been fixed. 
 
 REN-1103-60200     Illegal character(s) error message
 Certain free text fields on both the CA1 and CA2 GUI forms were not 
 preventing the input of illegal characters. When the claims were sent
 to DOL for processing, they were rejected due to these characters. Code
 has been put in place to check all free text fields for the following
 characters: ` ~ @ $ # % * _ | \ { } [ ] < >
  
 TAM-1203-31405     Incident Reports
 MIN-1003-41224     Incorrect Report Totals
 BHS-1003-11220     Problem with reports after OOPS2*2 patch
 PAL-1203-60613     LOG REPORT DATA ERROR
 CLE-0104-40115     GUI LOG NEEDS SITE NAMES
 BEC-1203-22153     Reports are not working correctly and pie 
                      does't work at all
 There are several issues involving incident reports, one is that the
 totals do not balance. When running a report for all incidents, the
 total received would be a larger number than received when running
 a report for service or body parts. This imbalance was due to
 unmatched services or body parts not being counted. In both
 cases, these uncounted incidents will be listed on the report as
 "Unknown" and the totals should balance. Pie Charts are not currently
 printing correctly, this has also been fixed. Also, on the reports
 if you attempt to run several reports without completely leaving the
 report selection screen, each subsequent report contains the previous
 report's data. Thus totals are incremented, and people appear several
 times in different reports. The code has been updated to clean out the
 previous report's data prior to displaying new reports.
  
 HUN-1003-22661     REQUIRED DATA NOT REQUIRED
 On the CA1 screen, the field "Does the agency dispute this claim" is
 marked as being a required field (asterisk next to the label). Yet
 if it is left blank during the signing process, no message is
 generated. The code has been fixed so it will be flagged that it needs
 to be completed prior to signing.  
  
 LEB-1003-22484     NULLSUBSCR 'IEN'
 SBY-0703-31570     $ZE= WITR+6^OOPSGUI2:2, %DSM-E-NULLSUBSCR
 On the CA1, if a user attempted to access the witness information prior to 
 selecting a case, a NULLSUBSCR error resulted.  ASISTS will disable the 
 ability to select a witness unless a claim has been selected for updating.
  
 BHS-0903-12070     Inappropriate message to supervisor
 References to the roll and scroll version of ASISTS have been removed from 
 the bulletins sent to users of ASISTS.
  
 BHS-0903-10940     Sec. Super needed if employee, non-paid, or volunteer
 The correction to this NOIS includes an enhancement request made by the 
 TAG.  Entry of a secondary supervisor will be allowed for all personnel 
 status.  However, the secondary supervisor field has been made required if 
 the personnel status is an employee, non-paid employee, or a volunteer. 
  
 BHS-0803-11537     Make Date of Incident reflect properly
 Changed the name of the Date of Incident prompt (ASISTS ACCIDENT 
 REPORTING File #2260, field #4) so that if the incident is an injury the 
 prompt reads: ** Date/Time of Injury and if the incident is an illness 
 reads: ** Date 1st Aware of Illness.
   
 TAM-0703-30061     Cannot select all stations in Institution file
 TNV-0104-30716     Institution selection from Station Number
 When the Institution File (#4) has an entry where the IEN has a decimal 
 point in it, ASISTS did not include it in the lookup list.   While this 
 situation should not be present, ASISTS has been modified to include these 
 entries in the Station Number lookup.
  
 MAR-0903-20336     AAC rejects claim if Volunteer on pay rate
 ASISTS has been modified to convert the entries in the pay rate and pay 
 rate per fields on the CA1 so that they will not be rejected by the AAC.  
 Continue to enter a zero in the pay rate field and any selection in the Pay 
 Rate Per fields.
  
 ISH-0303-40957     PAID lookup on valid SSN's
 When an employee is listed twice in the PAID Employee Master File (#450), 
 once with a valid SSN and once with a pseudo SSN (one beginning with '000') 
 ASISTS allowed either entry to be selected.  This situation would 
 potentially cause problems if the pseudo SSN entry were selected.  ASISTS 
 has been modified to not include entries from the PAID Employee Master file 
 for selection if the SSN begins with '000'.
  
 AUG-0104-30986     Allow amendments on claims sent to DOL
 CMS-0404-30122     Error message received on claim
 Since the roll and scroll version of ASISTS allowed amendments to be 
 created even if a claim had been sent to the Department of Labor (DOL), the 
 GUI version has been modified to also allow amendments on these claims.
  
 TAM-0104-30498     Icon comes up to see IRM
 Implemented functionality that will ensure that the client and server side 
 software are running compatible versions of the application.  This will 
 ensure that the GUI front-end will be 'in synch' with the M backend.
  
 LEX-0204-40140     <Enter> key causes 'contact IRM' error message
 When a user 'hit' the enter key in word processing fields, it left an 
 embedded carriage return / line feed which causes problems in filing claim 
 data.  Modifications have been made to remove any carriage returns / line 
 feeds behind the scenes from the data before filing. 
  
 PRO-0304-10254     Asist with correction
 A user was able to enter only a comma in either the Physician or Third Party 
 Name fields on a CA1 which resulted in a claim being rejected when 
 transmitted to the Department of Labor.  Validation checking has been 
 implemented that will prevent entry of only a comma on these fields.
