Subject: ELECTRONIC WAIT LIST REPORT ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1.  The formatting of the Appointment Wait List Report is incorrect.  The
     first page of the report is fine, but on all subsequent pages, the
     column headings are printing before each patient.
     Additionally, when printing the report to the screen, the up-arrow
     ("^") functionality, to immediately exit the report, is not working.
     This problem was also found in the PCMM Team/Position Wait List,
     Wait List Statistic, and Enrollment Wait List Statistic Reports when
     they are printed to the screen.  However, this problem only occurs
     when running a Summary for the Appointment Wait List Report and the
     PCMM Team/Position Wait List Report.
  
 2.  An error occurs when queuing the Appointment Wait List Report to a 
     printer.
  
 3.  Periodically, when running the Enrollment Wait List Statistic Report,
     an error occurs.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1.  BHH-0103-41570   Wait List Report not printing correctly
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The formatting of the Appointment Wait List Report is incorrect.  The
     first page of the report is fine, but on all subsequent pages, the
     column headings are printing before each patient.
  
     Additionally, when printing the report to the screen, the up-arrow
     ("^") functionality, to immediately exit the report, is not working.
     This problem was also found in the PCMM Team/Position Wait List 
     Report, the Wait List Statistic Report and the Enrollment Wait List
     Statistic Report when they are printed to the screen.  However, this
     problem only occurs when running a Summary for the Appointment Wait
     List Report and the PCMM Team/Position Wait List Report.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     To correct the formatting error in the Appointment Wait List Report,
     the code in routine SDWLRPS1 was changed to call the correct subroutine.
  
     To correct the up-arrow ("^") functionality (to allow the user to
     immediately exit the report), a flag was introduced in the form of
     a new variable, which will be checked to see if the user elected
     to exit anytime they are prompted to "Enter RETURN to continue or '^'
     to exit:".  This check has been added to routines SDWLRPS1 for the 
     Appointment Wait List Report, SDWLRPS1 for the PCMM Team/Position Wait 
     List Report, SDWLRSR for the Wait List Statistic Report and SDWLROI
     for the Enrollment Wait List Statistic Report.
  
     
 2.  BAY-1102-32172   <UNDEFINED> HD+11^SDWLRPS1
  
     Problem:
     --------
     An undefined variable error occurs when queuing the Appointment Wait
     List Report to a printer.  <Undefined> HD+11^SDWLRPS1.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The Undefined variable error is occurring because the routine which
     queues the Appointment Wait List Report to a printer, does not contain
     a ZTSAVE for variable SDWLF.  To correct this, a new line of code was
     added in routine SDWLRQ1.
  
  
 3.  MAD-0105-40330   <SELECT>SORT+6^SDWLROI
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When running the Enrollment Wait List Statistic Report, it will
     sometimes cause a $Select did not find a true expression error at
     line SORT+6 in routine SDWLROI.
  
     Resolution:
     ---------
     A default will be added to the $Select command found on line SORT+6.
     However, because routine SDWLROI exceeds the standard maximum size
     allowed, new routine SDWLROIS was created.  All of the sorting logic
     previously contained in routine SDWLROI will be moved to the new
     routine SDWLROIS.  Additionally, this error only occurred because
     the Wait List Type field (field 4) in file 409.3 was null.  New
     logic will also be added to routine SDWLROIS to automatically set
     this field in file 409.3 (to a value of 1, 2, 3 or 4), whenever
     possible, based on the data contained in one of the following fields
     in file 409.3:  5 (WL Specific Team), 6 (WL Specific Position), 7
     (WL Specific Service/Specialty), or 8 (WL Specific Clinic).
