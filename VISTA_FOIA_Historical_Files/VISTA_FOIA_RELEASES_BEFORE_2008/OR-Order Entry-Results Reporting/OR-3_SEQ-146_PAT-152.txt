Subject: Hui/VHA CIO SD&D Pharmacy Data Interchange

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 This patch is in support of the Hui/VHA CIO SD&D Pharmacy Data Interchange
 project. The project provides a method for the one-way electronic transfer
 of prescription orders from an external system to VistA.
  
 With this patch, CPRS will be making two changes to accommodate these 
 external prescriptions coming via the existing HL7 interface with the 
 VistA Outpatient Medications package:
  * Provider Comments will now be looked for and stored with the order,
     if passed in the message.
  * A service copy will be printed in the pharmacy if the nature of order 
     is null, indicating an order that originated external to VistA.
  
 Related Problems and NOIS:
 ==========================
 CPH-0602-43231   CPRS MED ORDER BUTTON/EXPIRED STATUS
 Prior to this patch, orders entered via the new BCMA "hot button" were 
 expired before being assigned a stop date; this prevented an entry from 
 being created in the Active Orders (AC) cross reference for the order, so 
 it never appeared on the Orders tab regardless of the value in the Active 
 Orders Context Hours parameter.  This has now been corrected.
