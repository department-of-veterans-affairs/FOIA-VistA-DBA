Subject: VIST PATIENT REVIEWS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description: 
============

 The VIST Patient Review software addresses VA Directive #2000-16: 
 Medical Rehabilitation Outcomes for Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury and
 Lower Extremity Amputee Patients and VA Directive 96-057: Ambulatory Care
 Data Capture. Although VIST Patient Review is a patch to be used in
 conjunction with VIST Version 4.0, it is a separate application (GUI) that
 is accessed from a desktop icon, not integrated with VIST Version 4.0
 (Non-GUI application).  However, it is to be integrated with VIST Version
 5.0 (GUI application) after development is finalized. 
  
 To continue the capture of data needed by the Blind Rehabilitation Program
 it is neccessary that the existing VISTA software, VIST v4.0 be modified
 to capture patient treatment data, and to send that data electronically to
 a location specified by the program office.
  
 This patch provides an installation executable that is used in 
 conjunction with the kids build to provide the user with a gui 
 environment that must be installed on the clients machine or as a 
 shortcut on a server.

         2.  Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
             installation, but you should select a time when minimal number
             of users are on.
  
         3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) 
             Menu, select the Installation menu.
  
         4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
             (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ANRV*4.0*5):
                 a.  Backup a Transport Global.
                 b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System.
                 c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
         5.  You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
         6.  Use the Install Packages option (when prompted for the

             respond "0".
        
        11.  Following successful installation, the post-install routine 
             ANRVOP may be deleted.
         
 Client Side:
 ===========
  
  
 Section 508 Note:  The software has been tested and will support a JAWS 
 Version 4.0 default system installation configuration.  For disabled users
 the client side executable program will need to be initially run one time
 by a user logged in as Administrator; this is required for third party
 programs such as "JAWS" to properly create COM registry entries.  
 Following this initial startup, the program should subsequently operate
 with the provided 508 functionality on that workstation for
 non-Administrator logins.
  
         1.  Retrieve and open the file ANRV_4_0_5.ZIP.
  
         2.  Execute the Setup.exe file to install the software to a server
             directory or on the users PC.  The setup file contains
             instructions on removing previous versions.  The setup file
             also contains step by step instructions for installing the
             software.  When the setup is complete the installation
             directory will have a subdirectory titled DOCUMENTATION that
             will contain the User Manual, Release Notes and a Quick
             Reference Guide for using the software these documents are in
             both PDF and Mirosoft Document format.  You should ensure that
             users have access to this directory so they can review the
             documentation.  The Installation file will also create a 
             shortcut on the users desktop title VIST Patient Review.
  
  
 The following lists the files that will be installed during the 
 installation.  It is assumed that the installation was performed into the 
 default directory (C:\Program Files\VistA\ANRV).  However you may want to 
 run the application from a server in which case you would use the path to 
 the server directory.
