Description: 
============

   VHA has received a request from VBA to update several exam worksheets
   in the VistA Automated Information Exchange (AMIE) package.  These
   worksheets provide general guidance to physicians at VA medical centers
   when performing Compensation and Pension (C&P) exams.  VBA has updated
   the exam text in response to changes in the Disability Rating Schedule,
   which went into effect January 12, 1998.
    
   Existing entries in AMIE EXAM file #396.6 for several exams will be
   inactivated:
   
   ARRHYTHMIAS
   ARTERIES AND VEINS
   AUDIO
   HEART AND HYPERTENSION
   MENTAL DISORDERS (EXCEPT PTSD AND EATING DISORDERS)
  
   Then file #396.6 will be updated with new entries for the following
   exams: 
   
   ARRHYTHMIAS
   ARTERIES, VEINS AND MISCELLANEOUS
   AUDIO
   GULF WAR GUIDELINES
   HEART
   HYPERTENSION
   MENTAL DISORDERS (NOT INITIAL PTSD AND EATING DISORDERS)
    
   Fourteen routines will be installed in order to generate the revised
   worksheets associated with these exams.
