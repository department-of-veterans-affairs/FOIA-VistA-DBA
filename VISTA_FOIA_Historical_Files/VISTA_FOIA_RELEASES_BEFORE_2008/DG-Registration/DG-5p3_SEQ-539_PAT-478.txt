  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This project consists of a set of patches that work together to create a
 new Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to
 provide rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical
 Reminders finding types are included in the index. 
  
 The patches that comprise this project are:
  
  PXRM*1.5*12
  DG*5.3*478
  GMPL*2*27
  GMRV*5*6
  LR*5.2*295
  OR*3*157
  PSJ*5.0*90
  PSO*7*118
  PSS*1.0*62
  PSS*1.0*89
  PX*1.0*119
  RA*5*33
  YS*5.01*77
  
 Note that PSJ*5.0*90 and PSS*1.0*62 have already been released and are not 
 included in the multi-package build.
  
 The purpose of this patch (DG*5.3*478) is to lay the groundwork for these
 changes by:
 1. Creating the DG routines that
    a) are used by the Clinical Reminders index building utility to populate
    the DG portion of the index.
    b) serve as an API to retrieve data identified by searching the index.
 2. Creating a series of new cross-references in the PTF file (#45).
 These cross-references update the PTF portion of the index whenever PTF
 ICD0 or ICD9 data is added, edited, or deleted. The cross-references are:
 
 Discharge Node  Movement Node
  ACR9DSD1        ACR9MICD1
  ACR9DSD2        ACR9MICD2
  ACR9DSD3        ACR9MICD3
  ACR9DSD4        ACR9MICD4
  ACR9DSD5        ACR9MICD5
  ACR9DSD6        ACR9MICD6
  ACR9DSD7        ACR9MICD7
  ACR9DSD8        ACR9MICD8
  ACR9DSD9        ACR9MICD9
  ACR9DSD10       ACR9MICD10
  ACR9DSD11
  ACR9DSD12
  ACR9DSD13
  ACR9DXLS        
  ACR9PDX
 
 Surgery Node    Procedure Node
  ACR0S1          ACR0P1
  ACR0S2          ACR0P2
  ACR0S3          ACR0P3
  ACR0S4          ACR0P4
  ACR0S5          ACR0P5
 
 The cross-references are named to make it easy to identify the coded value
 they index. First, they all start with "ACR" followed by a 0 if the code is
 an ICD0 code or a 9 if the code is an ICD9 code. The discharge node codes
 are named DXLS, PDX, SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 1 through SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 13.
 The movement node cross-references all have an "M" followed by the name of
 the code ICD 1 through ICD 10. The surgery nodes have an "S" followed by a
 number. These codes are named Operation Code 1 through Operation Code 5.
 The numbers in the cross-reference names correspond with these numbers. The
 procedure cross-references follow the same basic scheme; a "P" denotes
 procedure and the number matches Procedure Code 1 through Procedure Code 5.
 
 Note: This patch is informational; the build itself (DG*5.3*478) is
 distributed as part of a multi-package build, CLINICAL_REMINDERS_INDEX.KID.
 
 Host File:
 ==========
 This build is being distributed as part of a multi-package build so it will
 only be available as a host file. The name of the host file is:
 CLINICAL_REMINDERS_INDEX.KID. 
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses. The
 preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov. This
 transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 This file must be obtained in ASCII mode.
 
 Documentation:
 ==============
 An installation guide, PXRM_1_5_12_IG.PDF, and a technical manual,
 PXRM_1_5_12_TM.PDF, will be distributed with this patch. This documentation
 will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files. 
  
 Again, the preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites
 may also elect to retrieve documents directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 These files MUST be obtained in BINARY mode.
  
 The documentation can also be found on the Health System Design and
 Development Web page: (http://vista.med.va.gov/vdl/).
  
 Note:
 Due to the nature of this patch and the size of the ^PXRMINDX global
 that could be created on your system, the Office of Information strongly
 recommends that patch PXRM*1.5*20 be reviewed. 
  
 Patch 20 provided an estimated sizing utility that should have already
 been run on your system. It can be re-run, if desired.
  
 This index global will be large. Please be sure that your system manager
 is aware of this and the global growth potential before you do the 
 installation.
  
 Please read all the documentation before you proceed with the installation
 of PXRM*1.5*12.
 
 Build Components:
 =================
 
  Data Dictionary:
  ================
 The new series of "ACR" cross-references are added to the PTF file
 (#45) during the post-init by calling a FileMan API. No data dictionary
 components are in the build.
