Subject: UNSIGNED ORDERS ALERT AND MISC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The primary purpose of this patch is to correct the problem where unsigned
 orders sometimes do not generate an unsigned order alert.  It also
 provides more useful error messages when invalid input is entered into a
 generic order dialog's numeric prompt, and it corrects a problem where
 users limited to a restricted patient list cannot scroll past the first
 44 patients.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Patient Safety Issue (PSI):
 ==============================================================
 PSI 05-097 - Alerts not generated for unsigned orders

 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ===========================
 1. HD0000000110361 - No Alert for Unsigned Orders
    PSI 05-097 - Alerts not generated for unsigned orders
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Unsigned orders were sometimes getting lost in the system.  No unsigned
    order alerts were being generated for these orders, resulting in orders not
    being signed or acted upon for patients.  The known cause of this problem
    is when CPRS crashes after an order is entered, but before the Review/Sign
    Changes or Sign Orders dialog displays and is resolved.  Typically these
    CPRS crashes are the results of network connectivity issues, but other
    situations exist that will make CPRS crash.  It is unknown if there are
    other causes of unsigned orders being created without an associated alert.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The ORMTIME tasked job has been modified to search for orders that have not
    been signed for over an hour.  If no alert has been sent to these order's
    requesting clinician, or the clinician's surrogate, an appropriate unsigned
    order alert will be generated.  Unsigned orders that are older than 90 days
    old will not generate an alert.
  
 2. HD0000000069505 - SAG-0901-41159  CAN'T CREATE NUMERIC PROMPT
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In a generic order dialog, when you enter an invalid value into a numeric
    prompt, the displayed error messages do not indicate what values are valid.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When an "Out of Range" error is generated, the error message will now
    indicate what low and high inclusive values are valid.  When a "Too many
    decimal places" error is generated, the error message will now indicate how
    many decimal places are allowed.
  
 3. HD0000000135593   CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user is restricted to a specific list of patients that is longer
    than 44 patients long, the user is not able to scroll beyond the top 44
    patients.  The display will usually start over with the first patient in
    the list, when the 44th patient is reached.  The exception is when the 44th
    patient has an alias.  This will continue to cycle through the list over
    and over again.  When manually dragging the scroll bar down the side of the
    list box, the list will start at the appropriate place in the alphabet,
    allowing access to other patients, but scrolling from that point will cause
    the patient list to start over at the top of the patient list.  When
    manually moving the scroll bar down, it is impossible to scroll up the
    patient list.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The problem has been fixed.  Scrolling up and down the patient list works
    correctly.
  
  
 Routine Overview:
 =================
 ORB3 - Added an entry point to be used in generating alerts.
  
 ORMTIM02   New routine that searches for unsigned orders, determines if an
   order meets specific criteria, and calls ORB3 to create an alert as needed.
  
 ORMTIME - Modified to call the new ORMTIM02 routine.
  
 ORMTIMST   New routine with an API that determines if ORMTIME is currently
   running, and an API that determines the next time that ORMTIME is scheduled
   to run.  It also includes environmental check and pre-install check APIs for
   use by any patch that wishes to update ORMTIME.  It is intended to remain on
   the system for use by future patches.
  
 ORQPTQ11   Fixed bug in subroutine that returns subset of patients when
   scrolling through restricted patient list.
  
 ORWDOR   Changed error messages sent when invalid input is entered into a
   numeric prompt.  New messages show what input is valid.
  
  
 Environment Check and Pre-Installation Check Overview
 -----------------------------------------------------
 The ORMTIMST environment check routine does not take any action when the
 OR*3.0*253 global is loaded, only when the installation is about to take
 place.  The environment check determines if ORMTIME is currently running on
 the system.  If it is running, it waits up to 30 seconds for ORMTIME to finish
 running before allowing the install.  If ORMTIME is still running after 30
 seconds, the installation is aborted.  If ORMTIME is not running at the time
 of installation, but is scheduled to begin running within 5 minutes, the
 installation is also aborted.  Since user interaction is required between the
 time of the environment check, and the time the install begins, the
 pre-install check, PRECHECK^ORMTIMST determines if ORMTIME is running, and
 waits until ORMTIME completes before allowing the install to continue.  It is
 assumed that the user will take less than 5 minutes to answer the installation
 questions and complete the install, from the time of the environmental check,
 so that this delay should never be needed.  It has been added, however, to
 prevent ORMTIME from crashing while this patch is being installed.
