Description:
============

 **************************** IMPORTANT NOTE ****************************
 Patch IB*2.0*280 MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after installing this 
 patch.  Failure to do so may cause data problems with E_claims that will 
 bring the wrath of the clearinghouse down on you.
  
 IRM ... Review the patch instructions prior to the install. There are 
 pre-installation and post-installation functions that require your 
 attention. Coordinate the install of patches IB*2.0*232 and IB*2.0*280
 with your billing department.  Ensure that the IB ADPAC/Billing Supervisor
 has a copy of the patch descriptions and the EDI Billing User Guide.

 Background: 
 =========== 
 In order to meet federally mandated HIPAA (Health Information
 Portability and Accountability Act) compliant regulations,
 this patch has altered the EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)
 flat file map that is sent for electronic claims to contain all
 the information that is required to generate an industry
 standard (X.12 compliant) claim.
  
 HIPAA EDI requirements significantly alter the data the V.A.
 transmits in an attempt to eliminate the individual requirements
 dictated by individual payers.
  
   The overall concept of the HIPAA EDI guidelines is that "all
 data should be sent all the time" and the payers then can select
 which data is important to them.  As a result, the EDI data is now
 required to be 'standardized' and as long as all HIPAA required
 fields are transmitted, then a claim is not supposed to be rejected
 based on payer specific data requirements.
  
   In order to 'standardize' the electronic claim, the HIPAA
 guidelines require changing some basic characteristics of the
 electronic claim, specifically related to provider ID's. The file of
 data that is sent for electronic claims submission has been changed
 drastically.  The specific changes are not included in this patch
 description, but the new flat file layout document is available on the
 following website:
  
 http://tspr.vista.med.va.gov/warboard/anotebk.asp?proj=717&Type=Active 
  
  
  
 - Functional change summary:
  
 Because of the standardization of data, the Output Formatter
 overrides will only be available now for the ADMISSION HOUR and
 DISCHARGE HOUR fields on the bill transmission form.  All other
 local overrides found for the transmission form will be deleted.
  
 With the new requirements, there is a new primary ID transmitted
 for a performing provider. This is either a Social Security Number
 (for a person) or a Federal Tax ID number (for a non-person such
 as a group of providers).  This is NOT an optional ID.  All
 performing providers must be assigned this ID in order to bill
 for their services.
  
 Previously, you were required to have a primary performing ID
 type for each insurance company, for each form type (HCFA 1500
 or UB-92).  These IDs are no longer required for ALL insurance
 companies as the primary ID will be the SSN/tax ID as described
 above.
  
 HIPAA has allowed individual insurance companies to require sites
 to provide an additional ID, however.  This is now called the
 secondary performing provider ID and these are the ID's you can
 enter on Screen 8 when you add the performing provider to the
 claim.  This does NOT mean you HAVE to enter an ID on Screen 8
 for the insurance company.
  
 There are specific conditions that will require an entry here and
 these are discussed in the user document in detail.  Briefly,
 however, here are the 'rules' for deciding the appropriate
 performing provider ID that will be pulled for a claim:
  
 A maximum of one ID of each provider ID type from provider ID
 maintenance is allowed to be included on the claim.  The first ID
 of each ID type that is found according to the list below is the
 one that is sent:
  
   1. The ID and ID type found on screen 8, if any, for the
      provider.
   2. If an ID exists for the individual provider without a care
      unit, the ID is sent.
   3. If an ID exists for ALL providers for the insurance company,
      the ID is sent.
   4. If an ID exists for the facility, the ID is sent.
  
 The definition of billing facility ID's have been changed so
 the site can define them by division.  These are the ID's on
 billing Screen 3.
  
 Care units used for performing provider ID's have been modified to be a 
 little easier to understand and use.
  1.  Care unit set up has been simplified.  You no longer need to 
      create the care unit, then assign a combination.  The option for
      care unit maintenance now assumes you want to add a care unit
      if it doesn't already exist for an insurance company and
      automatically prompts you for a 'combination'.  The following
      prompts have been removed:
           ADD (I)NS. CO. CARE UNIT OR CARE UNIT (C)OMBINATION?:
           DO YOU WANT TO ADD A COMBINATION FOR THIS CARE UNIT NOW?:
  
  2.  There is no longer a requirement that a care unit be entered
      for a claim if the insurance company uses care units for the
      provider ID.
  
  3.  A care unit is no longer EVER required when adding an ID.
      If a care unit is entered when defining an ID, it is simply 
      attached to the ID and displayed in the list of choices for
      valid ids when entering the ID on screen 8 of the billing
      screens.  If no care unit is assigned to a performing provider
      ID, the ID simply exists and is displayed without the care unit.  
      Note that if an ID exists with and without a care unit, when a
      default ID is determined for the secondary ID for a provider on a
      claim, the system will default to the id without the care 
      unit because when determining a default provider id, it always
      ignores any IDs with care units.
  
  4.  The only place a care unit description is used now is on the 
      provider ID screen that is displayed on screen 8, when the
      list of valid IDs are displayed for the provider/form type.
  
 Supervising Provider has been added as a new Provider Function on
 billing screen 8.
  
 As a result of the provider ID changes, it is essential that the 
 insurance files be set up correctly. This patch deletes the data
 in the old primary performing provider ID parameters to accommodate
 the new definition of performing provider ID's. It copies the
 billing facility ID's for each insurance company to new fields for
 the default facility's division so additional ones can be defined for
 other divisions, if necessary.  It also deletes any performing provider
 ID's for insurance companies that have been deleted.

 PRE-INSTALLATION FUNCTIONS:
  
  1.  The four files (IB BILLING PRACTITIONER ID (#355.9), IB INSURANCE
      CO level BILLING PROV ID (#355.91), IB PROVIDER ID CARE UNIT
      (#355.95), IB INS CO PROVIDER ID CARE UNIT (#355.96)) where
      provider IDs stored are searched and if any IDs are found for
      insurance companies that have been deleted, the ID entries are
      deleted from the file.
  
  2.  The definition and the data in the following fields in the
      INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) are deleted to ensure all cross
      references and descriptions are fully removed before the newly
      defined fields are loaded with the install:
   
      4.01   PERFORMING PROVIDER ID TYPE
      4.02   PERFORMING PROV ID SOURCE
      4.03   DEFAULT PERF ID IF MISSING?
  
  3.  For all entries in the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36), the data for 
      the following fields is deleted to clean up the file:
  
      4.02   PERFORMING PROV ID SOURCE
      4.03   DEFAULT PERF ID IF MISSING?
      4.04   NETWORK ID SOURCE
      4.05   DEFAULT NETWORK ID IF MISSING?
      4.06   EMC ID SOURCE
      4.07   DEFAULT EMC ID IF MISSING?
      4.08   EMC CARE UNIT PROMPT
      4.1    ALTERNATE PERF PROV ID TYPE
      4.11   ALTERNATE PERF PROV ID SOURCE
  
  4. The data in field PERFORMING PROVIDER ID TYPE (#4.01) is saved and 
     becomes the default provider secondary ID for the HCFA 1500 form
     for the insurance company.
  
  5. The definition of the following fields in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399)
     file, subfile PROVIDER (#399.0222) are deleted to ensure all cross 
     references and descriptions are fully removed before the newly
     defined fields are loaded with the install:
  
     .05  PRIMARY INS CO ID NUMBER
     .06  SECONDARY INS CO ID NUMBER
     .07  TERTIARY INS CO ID NUMBER
     .09  PRIMARY PROV ID CARE UNIT
     .1   SECONDRY PROV ID CARE UNIT
     .11  TERTIARY PROV ID CARE UNIT
     1.01 PRIMARY EMC ID CARE UNIT
     1.02 SECONDARY EMC ID CARE UNIT
     1.03 TERTIARY EMC ID CARE UNIT
  
  6. The mail group MCH is created. It should contain the same
     remote members as the old MCR mail group it is replacing.
  
  7. Six new provider ID types have been added to the IB PROVIDER ID # 
     TYPE file (#355.97).  They are:
         PPO NUMBER
         HMO NUMBER
         SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
         STATE INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT PROV
         LOCATION NUMBER
         BILLING FACILITY PRIMARY ID
         
     In addition, the X12 qualifiers for all provider ID types are 
     updated according to the HIPAA standards.
  
  8.  The entry IB315 is deleted from the IB ERROR (#350.8) file
  
  9.  A check is made to insure the domain Q-MCH.VA.GOV has been added to
      the DOMAIN (#4.2) file only if the patch is being loaded in a
      production account.  The domain needs to be set up as follows or the
      patch will not be installed:
  
        NAME: Q-MCH.VA.GOV                      FLAGS: S
        RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV
  
      If you do not have the domain set up correctly, refer to patch
      XMB*DBA*162 for specifics on its set up.
  
  10. The provider id for CHAMPUS ID has been renamed TRICARE ID.
  
  11. All local override fields for the transmission fields included
      in this patch are deleted for the IB 837 TRANSMISSION FORM (for
      electronic claim submission) in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7)
      file.  Before deletion, the format code for each field is written
      to the install file for the patch.  If this data ever needs to be
      recovered, the data can be found here and manually re-entered.  If
      the build does not find any local fields, there will be no output
      referencing this in the install file.  Note that the overrides for
      ADMISSION HOUR and DISCHARGE HOUR on the IB 837 TRANSMISSION FORM
      are NOT removed by this install.
  
  
 POST-INSTALLATION FUNCTIONS:
  
  1.  A mail message is sent to a special mail group at the Albany OIFO
      confirming the site has installed the new version of the software.
      This mail group name is ZZ_EDIENHANCE@FO-ALBANY.MED.VA.GOV.     
      If, for any reason, the mail message cannot be successfully 
      created and sent, a bulletin will be sent to the members of the IB
      EDI SUPERVISOR mail group advising them to contact EVS to report
      this problem immediately. EVS can then send a manual confirmation
      to this mail group to advise them the site is running the
      EDI Enhancements software.
  
  2.  The data in the HOSPITAL PROVIDER NUMBER (#.11) and PROFESSIONAL 
      PROVIDER NUMBER (#.17) fields in the INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) are
      copied as entries in the new facility ID file (FACILITY BILLING ID
      #355.92).
  
  3.  Three cross references are deleted from the BILL/CLAIMS file that 
      reference CARE UNITS as they are no longer needed or used:
         PRIMARY INSURANCE CARRIER (#101) Trigger cross reference #4
           Deletes the PRIMARY EMC ID CARE UNIT field when the PRIMARY
           INSURANCE CARRIER field changes.
  
         SECONDARY INSURANCE CARRIER (#102) Trigger cross reference #5
           Deletes the SECONDARY EMC ID CARE UNIT field when the SECONDARY
           INSURANCE CARRIER field changes.
  
         TERTIARY INSURANCE CARRIER (#103) Trigger cross reference #4
           Deletes the TERTIARY EMC ID CARE UNIT field when the TERTIARY
           INSURANCE CARRIER field changes.

        --------------------------
        NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL
      
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
            (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

        a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch 
            install.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter
             IB*2.0*232
        b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
            YES//', answer NO (unless otherwise indicated)
        c.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
            and Protocols? YES//' answer YES (unless otherwise indicated)
        d.  When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
            Order':'  Enter the following options:
    
            Billing Supervisor Menu              [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR]
            Billing Clerk's Menu                 [IB BILLING CLERK MENU]
            Integrated Billing Master Menu       [IB MANAGER MENU]
  
        e.  When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
            Order':. press <return>.
  
        f. You MAY be asked if you wish to overwrite data dictionary 
           files, depending on your system settings. You need to answer 
           'YES' to all overwrite requests.
  
        g. You will be asked to supply a coordinator for the MCH mail 
           group. You should enter the person that is the currently the
           coordinator for the MCR mail group.
  
   7.   REBUILD MAPPED ROUTINE(S)  (DSM for Open VMS sites only)
        -------------------------
       Optional - Include the routines distributed with this patch
       in the mapped routine set.
      
       NOTE: This step is only necessary if you performed step 2 or 
             if you wish to include the routines in your mapped set.
  
  
 ************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**************
  
 Using Fileman Inquiry, verify the following:
  
 1.  Ensure the patch has changed the IB SITE PARAMETER File (#350.9) LIVE 
     TRANSMIT 837 QUEUE (#8.01) to:
       MCH
 2.  Ensure the entry MCH in the MAIL GROUP file (#3.8) has the following
     as a REMOTE MEMBER (#12):
       S.IBCE MESSAGES SERVER@XXX.MED.VA.GOV  where XXX is the site domain.
 3.  Check with your Billing ADPAC/Supervisor to see who should be assigned
     the new PROVIDER ID QUERY option [IBCE PROVIDER ID QUERY] as a
     secondary menu option.
     Then make the appropriate assignments for this option.
 4.  You may delete the pre and post installation routines IBY232PR and
     IBY232PO.
  
         ***************** SPECIAL NOTE ***************
 This patch makes substantial modification to the 837 format. Any local 
 fields in file 364.7 that reference the new 837 format will be
 DELETED as part of the install process. This was done because the flat
 file was reorganized and so many fields were moved and deleted that it was
 not possible to code a fix to allow local fields to continue to exist in
 this file.  Only local override fields for TRANSMISSION are deleted.  The
 override fields for transmission data ADMISSION HOUR and DISCHARGE HOUR
 will not be deleted and all local print overrides are still functional.
