Subject: VISTA STATE file (#5) Information patch 

Category: 
  - Database

Description: 
============

 OVERVIEW
  
 The VISTA STATE file (#5) and the Austin Automation Center's (AAC) edit
 table are not fully synchronized. This problem is causing VISTA reporting
 mechanisms to fail. 
  
 Most recently, Outpatient Workload reporting for Ambulatory Care has in
 some cases NOT been passing the standard edit checks, both locally at the
 sites and at Austin. The VISTA STATE file and the AAC edit table MUST be
 synchronized to enable sites to receive their workload credit.
  
 This is an informational patch providing instructions for synchronizing
 the VISTA STATE file (#5) and the AAC edit table. These recommended
 modifications will standardize State and County entries across all
 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers and with the Austin Automation Center.
  
 Following the general instructions, below, you will find step-by-step
 instructions (with examples) for making the changes to the VISTA STATE
 file. 
  
  
 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
  
   1) Use the VA FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to make
      all recommended modifications to the VISTA STATE file (#5).
   2) Should you require additional help using VA FileMan, see the
      VA FileMan User Manual, Version 21.0, Chapter 4 - How to Enter 
      or Change Data.
   3) The following Immunology Case Registry security keys should be 
      temporarily assigned to the IRM personnel responsible for making 
      these modifications to the VISTA STATE file:
        1.  IMRMGR
        2.  IMRA
      These keys are necessary to update pointers in the ICR SITE 
      PARAMETERS file (#158.9).
   4) Sample screen captures are provided to help illustrate 
      recommended procedures.
   5) You must be in programmer mode to make these modifications.
   6) All entries to the VISTA STATE file must be made in UPPER CASE and
      typed exactly as shown.
   7) The Return or Enter key is illustrated by the symbol <ret>.  It 
      is displayed in screen captures of computer dialogue when this  
      keystroke must be entered.
   8) It is understood that the repointing of FileMan entries may 
      take some time based on the number of entries involved.  In 
      fact it may take all night to complete just one step depending
      on the number of repointed entries, and it may take several
      nights to complete all of the parts of this patch.  The steps
      have been made to run sequentially but do not have to be run all
      at one time.
  
  
 YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EDIT YOUR LOCAL VISTA STATE FILE:
  
 PART 1:
  
 Assign yourself the IMRMGR and IMRA  Security Keys.
  
  
 PART 2:
  
 Use the VA FileMan option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to correct the
 following errors in the VISTA STATE file. (Be advised that some or all of
 these entries may not be in your local VISTA STATE file.  If you do not
 have any one particular entry in your STATE file, do nothing. Skip to
 the next instructions.)
  
    1) EDIT STATE FILE ENTRY: FOREIGN COUNTRY   
         If you currently have FOREIGN COUNTRY as a State entry in 
         your STATE file, follow these instructions otherwise go on
         to Step 2.
         
         a. Using the FileMan "Enter or Edit File Entries" option
            delete the State entry FOREIGN COUNTRY and update all
            pointers by re-pointing to the State entry OTHER.
         b. Exit option ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES to allow the 
            pointers to automatically update.
  
                NOTE: VA FileMan automatically generates a report 
                  displaying file entries in which, pointers 
                  have been changed. You can send this report to a 
                  local printer or to your terminal screen. This 
                  automatic report generation will take a few 
                  minutes.
  
  
          THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TO DO THIS:

 Note:  ARMD FORCES EURO,M-EAST,CANADA is to be types exactly as shown.  Do
 not correct spelling of ARMD.
  
        Additionally, If you do not have QUEBEC as a current entry 
        in your STATE file, add it now. (Otherwise, if QUEBEC is a 
        current entry in your STATE file, by now you should have 
        modified it using the instructions in STEP 1, line item 3.)
  
        STATE and COUNTY NAME          STATE      VA STATE  VA COUNTY

        THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW TO DO THIS USING THE 
        STATE AND COUNTY ENTRY "ALBERTA" AS THE EXAMPLE:
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 D P^DI  <ret>
  
 VA FileMan 21.0
  
 Select OPTION: 1  <ret>  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: STATE//  <ret>
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//  <ret>
  
 Select STATE NAME: ALBERTA  <ret> 
    Are you adding 'ALBERTA' as a new STATE (the 69TH)? 
    No// Y  (Yes)  <ret>
    STATE NUMBER: 75//  <ret>  
    STATE VA STATE CODE: 58  <ret>
    ABBREVIATION: AB  <ret> 
    VA STATE CODE: 58//  <ret>
    Select COUNTY: ALBERTA   <ret>

    VA COUNTY CODE: 260//  <ret>
    CATCHMENT CODE:  <ret>
    Select ZIP CODE:  <ret>
 Select COUNTY:  <ret>
 CAPITAL:  <ret>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Note:  In all of the above cases the State name and the county name are
 the same and should be entered as such.
  
  
 This completes the updates of the State File as required by this patch.
  
 PART 5:
  
 Deallocate the IMRMGR and IMRA Security Keys from your profile.
  
  
 This completes all of the parts of this patch.
