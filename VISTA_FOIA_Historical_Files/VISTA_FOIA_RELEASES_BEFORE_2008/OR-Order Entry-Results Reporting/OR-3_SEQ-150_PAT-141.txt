 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 =================
  
 Patch OR*3*141 implements the update of Event Delayed Orders (EDO).  
  
 Patch OR*3*142 provided the Event Delay Order Editor tool necessary to 
 build your delayed release events and auto-discontinue rules.  With 
 installation of patch OR*3*141, sites now have the code necessary to 
 implement their Auto-DC rules and Release Events.  Upon installation of 
 this patch the following parameters, once used to describe when to 
 auto-discontinue orders, are deleted: OR DC GEN ORD ON ADMISSION; ORPF DC 
 OF GENERIC ORDERS; OR DC ON SPEC CHANGE; OR DELAYED ORDERS LAPSE DAYS.  
  
 All orders that are currently on delayed status will be converted to 
 the "new" style and the orders will be mapped to an existing event, if 
 possible, or an appropriate event will be created in your OE/RR RELEASE 
 EVENTS (100.5) file.  In addition, entries will be made in the OE/RR 
 PATIENT EVENT (100.2) file as well, tying together the delayed orders 
 with the release event.
  
 A mail message will be sent to the installer indicating the results of 
 the conversion of delayed orders.
  
 A new version of file 100.2 is included with installation of this patch.  
 It will overwrite any existing version of this file.  
  
 A new global, ^ORE, is installed with this patch.  Placement, permissions, 
 and enabling of journalling will need to be addressed for the ^ORE global 
 when this patch is installed.  
  
 -- EDITOR AND PARAMETERS/PROTOCOLS
  
 The protocol OREV ADD CHILD was added to the release events portion of the 
 EDO editor for adding children to an existing release event.  Any event can 
 be a parent event, except an event that's already a child.  Children events 
 will be indented below their parents in the display.  Protocols OREV CHANGE 
  
 DISPLAY and OREV EDIT EVENT DELAY PARAMS were updated for this release. 
 Headers in the EDO editor display the view that you're viewing (all 
 entries/truncated view, etc.).
  
 The OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE and OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL parameters 
 were added to control who is authorized to manually release delayed 
 orders.  OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE CONTROL can be set at three levels.  It 
 can be set at:
  
    K (keys only)
    P (parameter only) 
    B (both keys and parameter).  
  
 No setting (this is as distributed) results in a default to K.  
 The parameter setting can be made at the system and division levels.  
 OREVNT MANUAL RELEASE is the parameter that will control who is allowed 
 to manually release a delayed order.  This parameter can be set at a 
 number of different levels and will only be evaluated when the CONTROL 
 parameter is set to P or B.  If the CONTROL parameter is set to B, you 
 would be allowing anyone with ORES or ORELSE security keys, as well as any 
 user given access through the parameter to manually release a delayed 
 order.
  
 The OREVNT COMMON LIST parameter was also added to this release.  This 
 parameter will allow you to set a "common" list of release events at a 
 number of different levels.  Only active, non-parent release events can 
 be placed on a "common" list.  In addition, once you've specified a 
 common list (even if it's only 1 event) you'll be allowed to set the 
 OREVNT DEFAULT parameter, which will specify the event you'd like to be 
 the default from the list that is specified at the same entity level.  
 For example, when you set up a common list for a service you can then set 
 the default for the service level list.  You can also edit the default 
 parameter directly.  These parameter names are not mis-typed, but purposely 
 named this way as generally speaking you won't interact directly with the 
 parameters.  The option 'Parameters for event delayed orders' [OR EVENT 
 PARAMETERS] has been provided to allow the Clinical Application Coordinator 
 access to edit the values.
  
 The OR PARAM COORDINATOR menu now contains a menu for event delayed orders. 
 This menu holds the EDO editor, the patient inquiry into file 100.2 
 (patient event file), and the parameter editor. In addition, the EDO editor 
 can access the parameter editor as well.  There are five parameters related 
 to EDO that can be edited from the menu or the EDO editor.
  
 A new parameter, OREVNT EXCLUDE DGRP, has been added to allow sites to 
 identify display groups that should be excluded, when the release event has 
 the copy active orders field set to yes.
  
 File 100.5 (release events) has two added new fields.  The first field, 
 PARENT, points the release event that is the parent of the child event.  
 In the INCLUDED TREATING SPECIALTIES multiple, the DEFAULT field has been
 added to identify a default treating specialty for a release event.
  
 A new input template was added to support add/edit of child events.  In 
 addition, all of the input templates were updated so that the DIVISION 
 prompt will be context sensitive.  In other words, for an admission type of 
  
 event it will prompt with ADMIT TO DIVISION and for a discharge type it 
 will prompt with DISCHARGE FROM DIVISION.  The detailed display was also 
 updated to display the appropriate division prompt.
  
 When a release event is a parent and it is inactivated, then all child 
 release events will be inactivated as well.  A child can be inactive, when 
 a parent is active, however, a child cannot be active when the parent is 
 inactive.  When viewing a detailed display on a child release event, there 
 is an indicator at the top noting that this is a child release event. 
 A release event may not become a parent if the release event already has 
 unprocessed, active delayed orders assigned to it.  
  
 Additionally, all information that is coming from the parent will be marked 
 with a (p), indicating that it is common information between the parent and 
 child.  Also, if you have included treating specialties and have specified 
 a default, that will be noted in the detailed display.
  
 -- EVENT DELAYED ORDERS
  
 - For generic order dialogs such as OR GXMOVE ADMIT PATIENT..., the 
 default treating specialties will be displayed in alphabetic order when 
 the user clicks the treating specialty box.
  
 - An information box is available at the top of the event selection 
 window which explains the difference between the ADMIT and TRANSFER events.
  
 - When medical students place certain orders, when reviewing/signing them, 
 on the Review/Sign order dialog the text "Signature will be applied to 
 Checked Items" reads "These orders will be held until signed".
  
 - On the Meds tab, when transferring inpatient orders to outpatient, an 
 information message pops up to remind the user to utilize the release 
 immediately radio button.
  
 - For the release event list box, if a user has a default event that 
 event will be displayed on the very top of the list followed with 
 '--------------------', then the transfer event and admission event.
  
 - For an event default generic text order, the treating specialty box will 
 only show the list of treating specialties tied to that event.  If no event 
 default treating specialties are available, all of the treating specialties 
 from the TS file will be retrieved for selection.
  
 -- ORDERS TAB
  
 - A new item called "Results history" has been added to the view menu 
 when viewing orders or when right-clicking on an order.  This menu item 
 will give a history of associated results for the previous 5 tests, 
 within the previous 5 years.
  
 - A "Write Delayed Orders" button has been added to the orders tab.  
 Clicking on the write delayed orders button will lead you through the 
 process of writing delayed orders.  The choices for delaying orders 
 will be the list of events as set up at a site using the tools 
 distributed in patch OR*3*142.
  
 - The ORDERS SHEET box has been changed to the VIEW ORDERS box and no 
 longer contains Admit, Transfer, and Discharge as items to select for 
 delaying orders.  The new "Write Delayed Orders" button (previously 
 described) should now be used.  The view orders box now contains an entry 
 for Active Orders as well as any delayed events that have been entered.
  
 - A new item has been added to the right-click and action menus called 
 "Change Release Event."  It allows users to assign an unreleased 
 order to a delayed event, either new or existing.
  
 - A new item has been added to the right click and action menus when 
 viewing orders on the delayed orders view called "Release Delayed Orders."  
 It allows manual release of the selected order.
  
 - A new item has been added to the view menu called "Auto DC/ Release Event 
 Orders."  This view will show a list of all past patient events.  When 
 selecting a patient event it will show all orders that were released or 
 auto-discontinued as a result of that event.
  
 - On the Toolbar, Views, Custom, custom orders, the order status window 
 is now a tree view.  In addition, when selecting all delayed orders 
 users will now see the orders listed by event with a column specifying 
 each event.
  
 - Move Patient Dialog: The Attending, Treating Specialty and Primary 
 Provider boxes are only presented for events of type "A" or "T".  For 
 a selected event, the first default treating specialty will be pre-
 selected in the Treating Specialty Box. 
   
 - When Copying/Transferring event delayed orders, the verify window 
 will be displayed for Med Orders, to ensure verification of order details.
  
 - From the meds tab, if a user transfers outpatient meds to inpatient 
 event delayed, when clicking on the orders tab the default will be the 
 event delayed orders screen instead of the active orders screen.
  
 - Under Auto DC/Release Event Orders, the orders displayed on the orders 
 sheet will be grouped by the status of the orders.
  
 - The column widths of Chart, Clk, and Nrs on the orders sheet have been 
 expanded.
  
 - For a user lacking OR* keys or Provider keys, when clicking Review/Sign 
 changes under the File menu, the message "These orders will be held until 
 signed" appears at the top of the window.
   
 - NOIS: BUT-1201-21129 - Fixed the problem of an expected first dose 
 showing when PRN box was selected.
  
 - NOIS: CPH-0302-41984 - Fixed the problem of orders not wrapping on the 
 sign off screen. 
  
 - NOIS: MIN-0602-40419 - When building an outpatient quick order in LM, 
 if you select NO to the "Include Patient Instructions in Sig" prompt, 
 the selection was not retained.  When placing the QO in the GUI, the PI 
 still appeared. This has been fixed.
  
 - NOIS BEC-0702-23114, HIN-1101-42117 - The duration field of the 
 medication order dialog for a complex order no longer allows free text 
 input.
   
 --ORDER CHECKING
  
 - NOIS: BUT-0502-22493 - Fixed order checking so users no longer get 
 duplicate order and duplicate med order checks against the original order 
 when copying or changing an order.  When testing in the GUI you could 
 select an existing order and then an Order Action of Change or Copy to a 
 New Order.  Previous to this patch, you'd receive a duplicate order/med 
 order check against the original order after clicking the Accept button.  
 While technically correct, the order check was bothersome because the user 
 knew the new changed/copied order was a duplicate.  The patch screens out 
 the currently-selected order from duplicate order checks when changing or 
 copying an order.  This works for both delayed and current orders.
  
 -- NOTIFICATIONS/ALERTS
  
 - NOIS: MAC-0602-62653 - The current user is no longer the default 
 selection on the alert recipient list when flagging an order for 
 clarification.
  
 - E3R: 17333 (Partial) - Changed default list selection for Alert When 
 Results order action from the current user to the selected order's 
 ordering provider.  If more than one order is selected, the ordering 
 provider from the first selected order on the list is the default.
  
 -- REPORTS TAB
  
 - NOIS: DAY-0701-41109, FRE-0202-61862, E3R: #15507 - "Imaging (local 
 only)" will now include reports filed for exams that were cancelled.  
 This was made possible by Radiology patch RA*5.0*26. 
  
 -- REMOTE DATA VIEWS
  
 - As part of this patch, additional checks are also made on the status of 
 the remote links.  If they are down, the user receives a message and the 
 selection of remote links is disabled.
   
 - NOIS: NHM-1100-12442 - When selecting a site for Remote Data, a check 
 is now made on the remote site to see if the patient is a sensitive 
 record.  If so, a dialog is displayed to allow the user to back out or 
 continue.  
  
 -- NOTES/CONSULTS/DISCHARGE SUMMARY/SURGERY TABS
  
 - NOIS: SFC-0602-62899 - When printing a multi-page TIU document to 
 a Windows printer, an extraneous trailing form feed was not being 
 correctly suppressed, resulting in an additional blank page.  This 
 has been corrected.
  
 -- PERSONAL PREFERENCES
  
 - NOIS: DAY-0701-41109, FRE-0202-61862, E3R: #15507 - When setting 
 personal title lists and default note titles under Tools/Options/Notes, 
 setting a title or a default title for the Consults document class was 
 not available.  This has been corrected.  
  
 -- CONSULTS TAB
  
 - OR*3.0*148 (GUI v19.15) contained a partial fix for an issue where 
 signature of an addendum to a consult note on the Notes tab was not 
 releasing a lock on the related consult order.  This patch contains an 
 additional fix for a similar issue on the Consults tab.
  
 -- SURGERY TAB  
  
 *********************************************************************
 These changes are based on testing of the new Surgery tab, and will only 
 become visible upon installation of Surgery patch SR*3.0*100. 
 This patch is currently at specific test sites as part of the Surgery 
 Electronic Signature for Operative Reports project.  Other sites will not 
 see a Surgery tab in CPRS.
 *********************************************************************
  
  - The sort option was removed from the custom view screen - this was 
 envisioned in earlier versions, but later design decisions resulted in 
 removal of the implementation.  To prevent confusion it has been removed.
  
  - Grouping by Operations vs. Non-OR procedures has been implemented.
  
  - Although view preferences could be saved, they were not subsequently 
 respected on the next session.  This has been fixed.
  
 -- SPELL CHECKING
  
  - Spell and Grammar Checking are still disabled due to a national 
 patient safety issue which awaits future resolution.  
  
 - Extra checking and insurance against the possibility of a failed 
 spell-check (for whatever system or network reason) and overwriting a note 
 with corrupted text or completely obliterating the existing text, has been 
 added.  But these changes will not become a factor until Spell Checking 
 is restored in a future version.
  
 -- PROBLEMS TAB
  
 - Testing showed that entry of a "^" character in the problem comment entry 
 box resulted in text following that character being truncated.  As with 
 List Manager, entry of the "^" character is now no longer allowed.
  
 -- MEDS TAB
  
 -- When tranferring an outpatient medication to inpatient medication the 
 user will now see the inpatient medication order dialogue instead of the 
 current order verify window.  
  
 - When copying an outpatient medication to inpatient for event delay, the 
 medication verify window now appears instead of the inpatient order dialog. 
 
 - NOIS: PUG-1102-50533 - Fixed mismatched display groups for the same 
 medication order on Orders and Meds tabs.
   
 -- TEMPLATES
  
 - When spell checking was disabled in previous versions because of patient 
 safety issues, the "Word Import" functionality in the template editor was 
 inadvertently disabled as well.  That functionality has been restored with 
 this version.  However, spell checking remains disabled until a solution to 
 the reported problems can be determined.
   
 -- MISCELLANEOUS
  
 - Patient identifying information (name and SSN) was added to the title 
 bar of the REVIEW/SIGN CHANGES screen.  An intermittent problem was 
 discovered in testing where, if rapidly cycling through a group of alerts, 
 the cover sheet could be displayed with no patient information while this 
 screen would be displaying a group of items for signature.  As a result, it 
 was not clear to which patient they were related.
  
 NOIS: AUG-0902-32324 - The Medication Administration History report 
 produces different results when called from CPRS and from BCMA.  The 
 Medication History is based on a single orderable item, and since IV Fluid 
 orders can and often do contain more than one orderable item, CPRS cannot 
 reliably build an accurate report with the current API supplied by BCMA.  
 Only the first of multiple items related to the IV order is displayed.  
 BCMA will need to provide a new version of this API which correctly 
 displays information for IV fluids in CPRS.  Until that time, the CPRS 
 report has been disabled for IV fluids only, and only on the Meds and 
 Orders tabs.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================= 
  
 PREVIOUS TO INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH:  INSTALLER MUST COORDINATE 
 WITH CAC TO ENSURE THAT SETUP OF FUNCTIONALITY PROVIDED BY REQUIRED 
 PATCH OR*3*142 HAS BEEN COMPLETED!  
  
 NOTE #1: The new global ^ORE is added by this installation.  
 Please make sure that this global has the appropriate access 
 privileges set (Read, Write, Delete) so that the installation can 
 write to it and proceed without interruption.  The ^ORE global should 
 be placed on a volume set with room for growth.  The estimated rate of 
 growth cannot be predicted at this time due to varying factors of 
 implementation of Auto/DC rules and Release Events.  The following 
 results from test sites may prove helpful:
  
    Site           Test Time   ^ORE Global Size  ^OR Global Size
    -------------  ---------   ----------------  ---------------
    Durham, NC     1 Month      .2 MB             8,500 MB
    Palo Alto, CA  2 Months    1.9 MB            10,989 MB
  
 NOTE #2: Post-install code included in this patch will set the 
 parameter ORWOR REQUIRE CURRENT CLIENT to "YES" at both Package 
 and System levels (the only levels applicable for the parameter) 
 at all sites upon installation.  
  
 Users must not be on the system during installation of this patch, 
 and installation should be scheduled at the least-intrusive time.  
 Installation is estimated to take from 10-40 minutes, depending on 
 the number of delayed orders which exist on your system.  Menu trees 
 must also be rebuilt, which impacts installation time.  
  
 1.  Obtain the file OR_30_141.KID.
  
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
     ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed
     from the mapped set at this time.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
     select the Installation menu.
  
 4.  Use Load a Distribution using OR_30_141.KID when prompted to Enter
     a Host File name.  You may need to prepend a directory name.
  
 5.  From this menu, you may then elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*141):
        a.  Backup a Transport Global
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
 6.  When ready, select the Install Packages option (when prompted for 
     the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*141).
     
 7.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? Yes//", respond "YES".
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
     YES//', respond YES. 
  
 9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the 
     options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
  
        OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN          CPRS Clinician Menu
        OR OE/RR MENU NURSE              CPRS Nurse Menu
        OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK         CPRS Ward Clerk Menu
        OR CPRS GUI CHART
  
 10. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
  
 11. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be 
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to 
     completion.
  
 12. Following successful installation, the pre/post-install routines 
     ORY141 , ORY141EC, and ORY141ED may be deleted.
  
 13. Set journalling to ENABLED for the new ^ORE global".  Set permissions 
     on the file to either RWP or RWD.  
  
 14. Retrieve and open the file OR_30_141.ZIP.
  
 15. Place the User and Technical Manual files in a location that can 
     be accessed by CPRS users.
  
 16. Move the CPRSChart.exe and help files to the appropriate directory 
     where they can be accessed by all CPRS workstations.
