Description:
============

 ******************************* N O T E *********************************
 There is no conflict between this patch and the CoreFLS software.
 Installation of this patch by the CoreFLS sites will not cause any 
 problems.
 *************************************************************************
  
 Prior to patch SR*3*100, the Procedure Report (Non-OR) included an 
 "op-top" section that included many of the data fields documenting the 
 procedure in the SURGERY file (#130) in addition to the provider's 
 dictated summary, if present. After patch SR*3*100, the Procedure Report 
 (Non-OR) includes only the provider's dictated summary since only the 
 provider's dictated summary is electronically signed. The only way to 
 review the information entered into the data fields documenting the 
 procedure in the SURGERY file (#130) is by way of the data entry options 
 on the Non-O.R. Procedures (Enter/Edit) [SRONOP-ENTER] menu.
  
 This patch adds the Non-OR Procedure Information [SR NON-OR INFO] option, 
 to the Non-O.R. Procedures (Enter/Edit) [SRONOP-ENTER] menu and to the 
 CPT/ICD9 Update/Verify Menu [SRCODING UPDATE/VERIFY MENU]. This option 
 will display the "op-top" information that formerly was part of the 
 Procedure Report (Non-OR). The output from this option may be viewed on 
 the user's screen or may be printed.  
  
 A future enhancement is planned that will incorporate the "op-top"
 information into an electronically signed document and thus be viewable in
 the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). At this time, the details
 of this enhancement and schedule for release are not known.

 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
