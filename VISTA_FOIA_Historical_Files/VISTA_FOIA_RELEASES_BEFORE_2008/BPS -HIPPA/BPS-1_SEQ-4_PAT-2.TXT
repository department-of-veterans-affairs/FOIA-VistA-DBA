Description:
============

 For the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
 National Provider Identifier (NPI) project, the Electronic Claims
 Management Engine (ECME) will be updated to use the NPI as the ID for both
 the pharmacy and individuals associated with an outpatient pharmacy claim.
  
 The NPI will be used in the following ways:
  
 1) The registration process will register the Pharmacy NPI with the 
    Austin Automation Center (AAC) when it is available.
 2) The facility ID portion of the Claim Transmission ID will use the
    Pharmacy NPI when it is available for the pharmacy and the ID has
    been registered with the AAC.
 3) Claim transmissions to the third party payer will use NPI for
    provider fields when the payer sheet, which controls the layout of
    the transmission, indicates that their use is required.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ------------------------
 Updated ECME documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field
 Offices.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server. Use Binary transfer protocol.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The documentation distribution includes:
  
      File Name                  Description
      ---------                  -----------
      BPS_1_P2UM.PDF             ECME User Manual V1.0
      BPS_1_P2TM.PDF             ECME Technical Manual/Security Guide V1.0
  
  (3) Documentation can also be retrieved from VistA Documentation Library
      (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
      http://www.va.gov/vdl, one to three business days after the release.
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre-install will remove the EPHARMACY APPLICATION REGISTRATION -
 TASKMAN [BPS APP REG TASKMAN] option from the list of scheduled processes.
  
 The post-install will run the automated registration process to register
 the current BPS Pharmacies with the Austin Automation Center (AAC).
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 In order to avoid disruptions, please install this patch during non-peak
 hours when users are not on the system. In addition, it is best to not
 install the patch when ECME claims are being created. Of particular concern
 would be the following background jobs and transmission activity.
  
 1. Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated by the 
    BPS Nightly Background Job [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]. Wait for this
    job to finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
 2. Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted to
    CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmission to finish or complete the
    installation before the transmission starts. Check with Pharmacy
    Service or your Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions
    occur.
 3. Since the post-install will be removing EPHARMACY APPLICATION
    REGISTRATION - TASKMAN [BPS APP REG TASKMAN] as a scheduled taskman
    job, please do not install while that job is running so that there are
    no issues with its removal.
  
  
 Install Time - less than 5 minutes
  
  
 ****************** PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *******************
  
 There is a pre-install that will run as part of this build. It will
 remove EPHARMACY APPLICATION REGISTRATION - TASKMAN [BPS APP REG
 TASKMAN] as a scheduled taskman job. Going forward, this job will
 be executed as one of the tasks of the BPS Nightly Background Job.
