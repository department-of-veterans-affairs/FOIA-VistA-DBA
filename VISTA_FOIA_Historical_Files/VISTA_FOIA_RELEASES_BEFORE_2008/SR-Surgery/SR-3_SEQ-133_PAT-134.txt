Description:
============

 1. LOCKING OF SURGICAL CASES FOR EDITING
    Patch SR*3*100 introduced locking of a surgical case when a user opens
    the case for editing, allowing only one user at a time to edit the same
    case. This patch alters how surgical cases are locked and allows
    multiple users to open the same case for editing up until the time that
    either the Nurse Intraoperative Report or the Anesthesia Report is
    signed. When a user enters the function to sign either report and after
    either report is signed, the software will again allow only one user at
    a time to open the case for editing. Neither report for a case can be
    signed while the case or a concurrent case is open for editing. If a
    case is locked and another user attempts to open the same case for
    editing, a message will appear on the screen indicating the name of the
    user that has the case locked. Likewise, if a user attempts to sign 
    the Nurse Intraoperative Report or the Anesthesia Report while the 
    case is open for editing, a message will appear on the screen 
    indicating the name of the user that has the case open for editing.
  
 2. ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS
    This patch modifies the software responsible for printing
    electronically signed surgery reports to honor the ALLOW CHART PRINT
    OUTSIDE MAS parameter defined in the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERS file
    (#8925.95). If this parameter is set to YES or is null, users will be
    allowed to choose between printing a work copy or a chart copy. If this
    parameter is set to NO, only users in MAS will be allowed to print a
    chart copy and all other users will be allowed to print a work copy
    only.
  
 3. QUARTERLY REPORT ARRAY CLEANUP
    This patch updates the software that generates the Surgery Quarterly 
    Report to kill a variable array that may cause problems when the
    Surgery Quarterly Report is transmitted from multidivisional
    facilities.
  
 4. DATE/TIME OUTPUT TRANSFORM CORRECTION
    This patch corrects the output transform used to display the external 
    format of several date/time fields modified by patch SR*3*125. Also, an
    update is made to the way admission, transfer and discharge date/times 
    are retrieved and stored for Surgery Risk Assessment.
  
 5. FIELD DESCRIPTION UPDATE
    In the SURGERY file (#130), the CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE field (#207) 
    field description is updated with the 2004 definition.
  
 6. PATIENT NAME/ID ON CARDIAC ASSESSMENT PRINTOUT
    This patch corrects a problem with the cardiac assessment printout in 
    which the patient ID is truncated if the patient's name is more than 
    16 characters in length.
  
 7. NOIS SHR-0904-71756
    This patch corrects the problem described in NOIS SHR-0904-71756 so
    that the printer is closed after printing the assessment upon
    assessment completion.
  
 8. CARDIAC TRANSMISSION UPDATE
    The cardiac assessment transmission is modified by this patch to 
    update the formatting of the date of death, if present.
  
 9. NOIS SBY-0904-31547
    Application of this patch prevents the problem described in NOIS
    SBY-0904-31547.
  
 10. ATTENDING REQUIRED BEFORE COMPLETING CASE
    To prevent possible cosigner problems with the Operation Report and the
    Procedure Report (Non-OR), this patch will require that the attending
    surgeon/provider be entered before the case can be completed.
  
    When a user enters the TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232) in the SURGERY 
    file (#130), to complete a surgical case, if the ATTEND SURGEON field 
    (#.164) is blank, the software will prompt the user to enter the 
    attending surgeon. For non-OR procedures, when a user enters the TIME 
    PROCEDURE ENDED field (#122), if the ATTEND PROVIDER field (#124) is 
    blank, the software will prompt the user to enter the attending 
    provider.
    
    If the SURGICAL RESIDENTS (Y/N) field (#33) in the SURGERY SITE 
    PARAMETERS file (#133) is set to NO, when a surgeon is entered in the 
    SURGEON field (#.14) in the SURGERY file (#130), the software will 
    enter the surgeon in the ATTEND SURGEON field (#.164). For non-OR 
    procedures, when the provider is entered in the PROVIDER field (#123), 
    the software will enter the provider in the ATTEND PROVIDER field 
    (#124).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed with Surgery users off the system.
 Installation takes less than two minutes. Installation of this patch
 may be queued.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from mapped set at this time.
  
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
  4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter SR*3.0*134):
  
     (a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     (b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
  
     (c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
     (d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package SR*3.0*134.
  
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled options, Menu options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  8. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
