Subject: DATA UPDATES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description: 
============

 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
  
 This patch generates three mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
 and all are sent to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the
 PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  The first
 message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products,
 CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs,
 products for which the national formulary indicator has changed,
 products that have been unmatched from CMOP, and products for which
 the national formulary restriction has changed.  The second,
 with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists interactions that
 have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with the subject
 DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file
 (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
