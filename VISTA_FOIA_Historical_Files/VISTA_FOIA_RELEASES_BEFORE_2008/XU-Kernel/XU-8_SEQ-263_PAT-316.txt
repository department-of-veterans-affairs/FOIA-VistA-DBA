Subject: Reporting Options for Alerts

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch provides several reporting options for Alerts, including
 ones that: list users with large number of alerts in the ALERTS file
 (#8992); list alerts for a specified user from a specified date; list
 alerts for a specified patient for a specified day or date range. 
 Since the retention period for alerts in the ALERT TRACKING file
 (#8992.1) is currently a site parameter, some users may have alerts
 in the ALERTS file that no longer are present in the ALERT TRACKING file,
 data from both sources is used when necessary.
  
 This patch adds the following options:
  
 Report Menu for Alerts (XQAL REPORTS MENU)
  
 This menu provides several options for generating reports on alerts for
 users or patients.
  
  
 User Alerts Count Report  (XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT)
  
 This option is used to generate a report on users who have more than a
 specified number of alerts in the ALERTS file (#8992).  The report covers
 a specified range of dates, and can be sorted by user name, number of
 alerts, or by service/section.  In addition, the report in each of these
 formats may be generated by Divisions if desired.
  
 For each user who has the specified number of alerts or more, the report
 includes the user name, the section/service for the user, the number of
 alerts in the ALERTS file, the last sign-on date, the number of Critical
 alerts or Abnormal Imaging alerts, and the date of the oldest alert.
  
 The counting of alerts may also be restricted to those alerts which contain 
 specific text or phrases.
  
  
 Critical Alerts Count Report (XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT)
  
 This option is used to generate a report of users who have more than a
 specified number of alerts containing the word 'critical' or the words
 'abnormal imaging' between the specified start and end dates. The report
 is presented in descending order for the number of critical/abnormal
 imaging alerts present.
  
 For each user who has the specified number of critical/abnormal
 imaging alerts or more, the report includes the user name, the
 section/service for the user, the number of alerts in the ALERTS file, the
 last sign-on date, the number of Critical alerts or Abnormal Imaging
 alerts, and the date of the oldest alert.
  
  
 List Alerts for a user from a specified date (XQAL ALERT LIST FROM DATE)
  
 This option is used to obtain a list of alerts from the ALERT TRACKING
 file (#8992.1) for a specified user for a specified date range.  The user
 may select all of the alerts to be displayed, or enter specific text or
 phrases to select only alerts which contain the specified text.  In the
 latter case, the user may also select to see only those alerts which match
 the criteria and are only info only alerts, only action alerts, or both.
  
 The listing includes the internal entry number for the alert in the ALERT
 TRACKING file, the date and time the alert was generated, the message
 text of the alert, and information about any option or routine to be
 executed for processing the alert.
  
  
 Patient Alert List for specified date (XQAL PATIENT ALERT LIST)
  
 This option is used to obtain a list of alerts for a specified patient
 from the ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1) for a selected date range (it is
 recommended that this range be only a few days at most, since every entry
 in the ALERT TRACKING file in the selected date range must be checked to
 provide a complete listing of alerts for a patient).
  
 A prompt is provided to obtain a quick scan listing of dates with at least
 some alerts for the patient on it based on OR and DVB alerts (other
 patient related alerts need to be identified by looking at each alert's
 message text and are included in the full list, but not the quick scan).
  
 The user may select all of the alerts to be displayed, or enter specific
 text or phrases to select only alerts which contain the specified text. 
 In the latter case, the user may also select to see only those alerts
 which match the criteria and are info only alerts, only action alerts,
 or both.
  
 The listing includes the internal entry number for the alert in the ALERT
 TRACKING file, the date and time the alert was generated, the message
 text of the alert, and information about any option or routine to be
 executed for processing the alert.
  
  
 View data for Alert Tracking file entry  (XQAL VIEW ALERT TRACKING ENTRY)
  
 This option can be used to obtain a listing of data in captioned format for
 selected entries in the ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1).  The internal entry
 numbers for the entries to be listed must be entered individually.
  
  
 There were no NOIS or E3Rs related to this patch.
