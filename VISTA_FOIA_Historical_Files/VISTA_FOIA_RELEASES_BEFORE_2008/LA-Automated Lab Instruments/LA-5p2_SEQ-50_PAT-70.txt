 Blood Bank Team Coordination
 ============================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*70 does 
 not contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 VHA DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*70 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*70 have no effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION:  Because of the nature of the changes
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
 ************************************************************************
  
 Patch LA*5.2*70 modifies the HL7 ORU process for all laboratory messages 
 that are reporting "CH" (Chemistry) subscript results in OBX segment 
 sequence three (OBX-3) to return the Logical Observation Identifiers 
 Names and Codes (LOINC) + National Lab Test (NLT) + local coding 
 information in OBX-3. This change was requested by the Clinical Case 
 Registry (CCR) because they discovered a number of unreported LOINC codes 
 in both the HIV and Hepatitis C databases that impacted their ability to 
 analyze the data.
  
 NOTICE: Sites that have installed LA*5.2*64 DO NOT INSTALL this 
 patch.  This patch provides functionality that is included in LA*5.2*64.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system, however these
   users should not be using any of the Laboratory's package verifying  
   options.
   Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   The installation should NOT be queued.
  
   NOTE: Sites that have installed LA*5.2*64 DO NOT INSTALL LA*5.2*70
  
   NOTE: Laboratory verification options should not be used during 
         installation of this patch or data loss may occur.
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
       Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory
       Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC).
  
   1.  If any of the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*70'.
  
       When prompted
         'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?' 
       choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 
          'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 
           'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
            Protocols?  YES//'
       choose 'NO' unless site has additional local laboratory  
       accessioning and verifying options that should be disabled 
       during install.
  
       The install will automatically disable the following options:
       Accession order then immediately enter data         
                                                 [LR ACC THEN DATA]
       Batch data entry (chem, hem, tox, etc.)             [LRSTUF]
       Bypass normal data entry                            [LRFAST]
       Enter/verify data (Load list)                       [LRVRW2]
       Enter/verify data (Work list)                       [LRVRW]
       Enter/verify data (auto instrument)                 [LRVR]
       Enter/verify/modify data (manual)                   [LRENTER]
       Fast Bypass Data Entry/Verify                       [LRFASTS]
       Group verify (EA, EL, EW)                           [LRGV]
       Special test accessioning                           [LRNONCOM]
  
  
   7. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
