Subject: PERIOD OF SERVICE IN AD HOC REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

 1. This patch will add the field Period of Service (Field #31 of file
 #745.1, CUSTOMER CONTACT FILE) to the Ad Hoc Report.  This is being done
 as users may want to sort by those patients who served during the period
 of time when the Persian Gulf War was taking place, rather than by only
 those patients actually in that theatre.  They might also have need of
 sorting on other Periods of Service.  This issue was raised by NOIS
 BAY-0599-32253.
  
 2. This patch will correct an error in the VA Alerts generated by the
 Patient Representative package.  Currently, a comment appears in the
 RESOLUTION COMMENTS field in the CUSTOMER CONTACT file (field #25 in file
 745.1) stating that the VA Alert was deleted by ___________, but the name
 that appears is the name of the person who entered the ROC, not the person
 who deleted the alert.  This problem is fixed in the patch, and was
 addressed in NOISs CAH-0699-31593 and NCH-0699-42652.
  
 3.  This patch will allow users to select either a Detailed or Summary
 Customer Service Standards Report.  The level of detail provided in the
 current Customer Standards Service Report is more than necessary in some
 instances. This issue was addressed in NOIS HVH-0699-12181.
  
 4.  It was reported that the Spreadsheet Report [QAC SPREADSHEET RPT]
 errored out if the output was queued.  This issue is addressed in NOIS
 ROS-0799-50466.
  
 5.  A null subscript error occurred when calling the Customer Service
 Standards Report [QAC CSS] if a record in the report had an incorrectly
 established Service/Discipline.  This problem occurred if the
 Service/Discipline had no Discipline associated with it.
 (Discipline is a required field in the entry of Service/Discipline, but
 entry could be avoided by exiting abnormally from the entry process using
 option Add new Service/Discipline [QAC NEW SERV].)  With this patch the
 Customer Service Standards Report (detailed option) will list these
 records under Discipline: Unknown.  The entry process, option Add new
 Service/Discipline [QAC NEW SERV], will now check for the presence of a
 Discipline.  If there is none, a message will display and the user will be
 given a chance to enter one.  If there is still none entered, a message
 will display saying that no Discipline was entered and the
 Service/Discipline is deleted.  This issue was addressed by NOIS
 NYN-0799-10566.
  
  
  
 This patch addresses the following NOIS messages:
  
 BAY-0599-32253, CAH-0699-31593, HVH-0699-12181, NCH-0699-42652,
 NYN-0799-10566 and ROS-0799-50466.
  
  
  
 If installed during the normal work day it is recommended that the
 following menu options (File #19) and all of their descendants be
 disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install.
 Other VistA users will not be affected.
