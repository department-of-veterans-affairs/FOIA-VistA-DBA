Subject: BLOOD BANK COMPONENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

    
    This patch modifies the Blood Bank Health Summary Components "Blood
    Transfusion" and "Blood Availability" in support of the Blood Bank
    Modernization Project.  Health Summary code found in routines 
    GMTSLRT and GMTSLRB has been modified to call the new Blood Bank 
    APIs to extract Transfusion and Availability data.
    
    Health Summary users will not see any change in how the Blood Bank
    components display.

          load the KIDS Transport Distribution global.
         
      2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines GMTSLRT or GMTSLRB are 
          mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
          
      3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
          select the Installation menu.

            a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            b.  Print Transport Global
            c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System
            d.  Backup a Transport Global
         
      5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
          GMTS*2.7*59.

          should be returned to the mapped set once the installation has
          run to completion.
