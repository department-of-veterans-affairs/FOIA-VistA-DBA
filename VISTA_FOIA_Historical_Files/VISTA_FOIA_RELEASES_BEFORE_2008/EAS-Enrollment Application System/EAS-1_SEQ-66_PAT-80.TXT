Subject: REPRINT 60 DAY LETTERS PRINTING NON-USER ENROLLEES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  I.  OVERVIEW
  
  The EAS MT REPRINT LETTERS (Reprint Letters by Processing Date) option
  prints letters that should not have printed, due to the patient not being
  a User Enrollee at the site.
  
  Also, the note that displays when reprinting the letters is misleading,
  in that it mentions that "ALL" letters will print with this option,
  when it should reprint "all valid" letters.  This note was changed.
  
  
  II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
  
  The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service Requests
  associated with this patch.
  
  Associated Remedy Tickets:
  --------------------------
  HD0000000147907 - 60 Day Letters
  
  Problem: The number of letters that should print is much less than the
  number of letters that actually print, based upon the statistics in the
  Mailman message that is sent to the mail group EAS MTLETTERS.
  
  Solution: Copy the check for User Enrollee that is included in the option
  to print the letters the first time and add it to the option to reprint
  the letters.
  
  
  Associated New Service Request(s):
  ----------------------------------
  NONE
  
  
  III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

  patch:
  
  When the means test letters are reprinted, the process will now check to
  see if the patient is a User Enrollee at the site.  If not, then the letter
  should not print.
