Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) 
 project.  PFSS patches are being released on various schedules.  Some 
 patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is 
 activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented 
 at select pilot sites ONLY.
  
 The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for 
 the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing 
 replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
 billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
 enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing 
 replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
 ancillary packages are necessary.
  
 Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
 On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON" .  The 
 ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON"  will be provided at 
 the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
 patch.
  
 For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
 accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
 http://vista.med.va.gov/billreplace/
  
 The enhancements in this Patch will ensure that all orders will have: 1) 
 a PFSS Account Reference that is associated to the order and 2) a valid 
 CPT and Department code for sending to PCE for proper charge of Radiology 
 procedures.
  
 No changes will be noticeable to the user community due to the 
 modifications made for this project.  No new prompts nor any changes to 
 report output or formatting will occur.  No additional processing time 
 should be noticed as a result of these modifications.
  
 2 new fields have been added :
  
   File RAD/NUC MED ORDERS FILE (#75.1) has a new field added:
      PFSS ACCOUNT REFERENCE                 (#90)
      Points to file PFSS ACCOUNT (#375)
  
   File IMAGING TYPE (#79.2) has a new field added:
      PFSS Dept. Code (#90)
  
 1) Routine RA57PST is new and is the post installation routine which will 
 loop through file #79.2 and insert the appropriate Department Code. This 
 routine may be deleted after RA*5*57 is installed.
  
   2) Routine RABWIBB is new and contains code that is used to check the 
 switch status, to initialize some input variables for an IBB API, to get 
 a PFSS Account Reference for both CPRS (frontdoor) and Radiology 
 (backdoor) orders, to cancel a PFSS Account Reference, and to retrieve 
 the Department Code and PFSS Account Reference.
  
   3) Routine RABWIBB2 is new and contains coding that sets up the 
 remaining variables required by an IBB API. This routine then calls the 
 IBB API to collect the new PFSS Account Reference which is passed back to 
 the calling routines.  It also stores the PFSS Account Reference in the 
 RAD/NUC MED ORDERS file, #75.1.
  
   4) Routine RABWORD is a modified routine which contains coding that 
 will trigger the process of retrieving a new PFSS Account Reference when 
 a new order is placed, from both CPRS (front door) and from Radiology 
 (back door).  It will not trigger this process if a back door order was 
 updated from CPRS.
  
   5) Routine RABWORD1 is a modified routine which contains coding to flag 
 that we're processing a CPRS update to the ordering DX and ordering 
 clinical indicators of a back door order.
  
   6) Routine RAO7OKS is a modified routine which contains coding to get a 
 new PFSS Account Reference for a new order placed from CPRS (front 
 door).  This number will be passed back to CPRS in a new PV1 segment of 
 the pseudo HL7 message and  will be stored in the Radiology application.  
 This routine also contains coding to cancel an existing PFSS Account 
 Reference when an order is discontinued from CPRS (front door).  
  
  
   7) Routine RAO7UTL is a modified routine which contains coding to 
 include the PFSS Account Reference in the PV1 segment of the pseudo HL7 
 message to CPRS, for a Radiology (back door) order.
  
  
   8) Routine RAORDU is a modified routine which contains coding which 
 checks if the Request Status is DISCONTINUE, and if it is, send a 
 "Delete" event to IBB.
  
  
   9) Routine RAPCE is a modified routine which contains coding which will 
 check the PFSS status switch and if it is active will send the Department 
 Code and PFSS Account Reference to PCE.
  
 The Radiology Technical manual will be updated with a subsequent 
 patch release.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
  The install time for this patch is less than five minutes.  Since the
  entire exam status mechanism may be affected, you should install this 
  patch at a time when Rad/Nuc Med users are off the system.
   
  NOTE:  MailMan and Kernel patches must be current on the target system to
         avoid problems loading and installing this patch.
   
  1. If the above routines are mapped, disable mapping for them.
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of your PackMan menu to load
     the KIDS patch onto your system.
   
  3. The patch has now been loaded, on the 'Kernel Installation &
     Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select the 'Installation' menu.
   
     From this menu you may choose the following options prior to
     installing this patch:
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
         installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.)
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routine that is in the transport
         global.
   
  4. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu.
     When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter: RA*5.0*57.
  
  
     When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//", respond NO.
  
     When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?
     YES//", respond YES.  
  
     When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
     enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med options:
      
       RA*
   
     When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of Order':",
     enter the following to disable all Rad/Nuc Med protocols:
   
       RA*
   
  5. Verify that the patch installation completed correctly by using the
     KIDS "Utilities..." [XPD UTILITY] option's 'Install File Print'
     [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] option and selecting this patch (RA*5.0*57).
  
  6. On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.
