  - Routine

Description: 
============

  IMPORTANT NOTE:
  Although this patch is NOT being sent out as an EMERGENCY patch,
  the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD) development
  team and the Master Patient Index Data Quality Management team
  request that you install the patch as soon as your schedule allows.
  Additional development in progress, described below, is dependent
  upon this patch being installed at all facilities.
   
  Also, the MPI/PD development team s facility access should
  remain active until all phases in this process are completed.
     
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Coordinating Master of Records (CMORs), treating facilities,
  or subscribers.
   
  This patch includes enhancements that are proposed in the Master
  Patient Index/Patient Demographics, Phase III Enhancements, 
  Software Design Document.
   
  A series of patches will be distributed to implement a new messaging
  structure for Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD). 
  Our current message scheme uses the Coordinating Master of Record
  (CMOR) as the origination point for a number of update messages to
  other treating facilities.  Overall, our objective is to reduce the
  amount of facility to facility messaging.  This will be done by using
  the Master Patient Index (MPI) as the source for update messages. 
  For those message types that require CMOR action, the CMOR will update
  the MPI, and the MPI will distribute updates to the appropriate
  treating facilities.
   
  Changes to messaging will include using a new generic Health Level
  Seven (HL7) 2.4 message builder for the ENV, PD1, and PID segments. 
  Additionally, HL7 application acknowledgements will be incorporated
  in all MPI/PD messages.
   
  These changes will take place in three phases.  Patches DG*5.3*428,
  MPIF*1*22, and RG*1*26 constitute phase one.  These patches
  contain the protocols and routines to execute those protocols for
  the new messaging.  These patches must be installed at all facilities
  before the second step in the process can begin.  The processing
  routines included in these patches will be dormant until then.
   
  The second phase will update the necessary routines to call the new
  trigger events using the updated messaging structure.  The trigger
  events will include the following.
  - Add new patient to the MPI
  - Link to an existing patient on the MPI
  - Update to non-key fields on an existing MPI entry
  - Update to key fields on an existing MPI entry
  - Update to date last treated
  - Resolution of duplicates at the site where both entries
    exist on the MPI
  - Resolution of duplicates on the MPI
  - Identification and resolution of a mismatched patient
  - Inactivation of existing entry on the MPI
   
  Patches for the second phase must be installed at all facilities
  before the subsequent step can begin.  Patches DG*5.3*474,
  MPIF*1*24, and RG*1*27 constitute phase two.
   
  The next step is a data synchronization process to populate new
  fields in the MPI FACILITY ASSOCIATION (#985.5) file on the MPI
  for each facility associated with a national integration control
  number.
   
  The third phase will contain additional messaging functionality
  that can not be implemented until the synchronization process has
  completed.  A final group of patches will clean up obsolete routines,
  protocols, options, etc. that are no longer used.
   
  To summarize, patches DG*5.3*428, MPIF*1*22, and RG*1*26
  contain the protocols and routines to execute those protocols for
  the new messaging.  The processing routines are not invoked until
  the second phase in the process.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
  
    This patch takes less than 3 minutes to install.  This patch should
    be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.   
  
    1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
        
    2.  TaskMan does not need to be stopped or placed in a wait state. 
   
    3.  These routines are not usually mapped, so you will probably not
        have to disable mapping. 
  
    4.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. [Note:
        TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display the
        patch text only.
  
    5.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.  
  
    6.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
        d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
  
    7.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        MPIF*1.0*22.
   
    8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? '
        YES//', respond No.
   
    9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes and enter the following options:
  
         Create a New CMOR Change Request        [MPIF NEW REQUEST]
         Edit Open CMOR Change Request           [MPIF EDIT REQUEST]
      
   10.  If you unmapped routines in step 3, remap them after installation
        has completed.
