 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
 1. CPH-1001-40262  CANCEL BILL PROBLEM
    
    Problem:
    ----------
    When using the IB CANCEL BILL (Cancel Bill) menu selection, and 
    when an error was returned from the Accounts Receivable (AR) PRCA 
    process, indicated by a "-1", the IB process did not test for an error 
    and displayed a payment of "$-1" as follows: "Please note a PAYMENT 
    of **$"-1"** has been POSTED to this bill."
    
    Resolution:
    -------------
    Error handling code was added to the IB CANCEL BILL process to 
    recognize the error indicator being passed back by AR and to display 
    the following warning message: "Please note: PRCA was unable to 
    determine if a payment has been posted"
    
 2. ATG-0203-30660     Bills pointing to wrong fund 
    
    Problem:
    ----------
    Sites have bills resulting from ineligible hospitalization outpatient 
    care but the RATE TYPE file (#399.3) does not have a RATE TYPE of 
    INELIGIBLE.
    
    Resolution:
    -------------
    A new RATE TYPE of INELIGIBLE is added to the RATE TYPE file 
    (#399.3) pointing to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY: INELIGIBLE 
    HOSP. New Rate Schedules of INELIG-OPT and INELIG-INPT will also be
    added to the RATE SCHEDULE file (#363). This will be added with the
    post init routine IBYP241.
