Description: 
============

 Patch Tracking #: 35158637
 Test Sites: OIFO-SALT LAKE CITY, NEW YORK HCS, OIFO-BIRMINGHAM,
             OIFO-WASHINGTON
 Blood Bank Clearance: 10/17/2002
  
 NOIS: ISL-0902-50312/HD-6133,CHG-1425
 Problem: The way that KIDS files new entries from the PARAMETER TEMPLATE 
 (#8989.52) file on the target system.  The exported entries get filed, 
 but the "B" x-ref on the PARAMETERS multiple (field 10) doesn't get 
 filed. This causes the Edit Parameter Values with Template [XPAR EDIT BY 
 TEMPLATE] option to fail as it does not see any parameters to edit 
 within the template.
 Fix: Set the flag to have FileMan cross reference the data.
  
 NOIS: NYH-0202-10681/HD-8280,CHG-2694
 Problem: When queuing during patch install.  The user tried to queue the 
 patch for 9:00PM at night but omitted the word PM from the time.  The 
 system didn't prompt me that it was a wrong time in the past (9:00 AM) 
 nor did it prompt me to reenter the correct time.  It went and installed 
 the patch immediately as if it accepted the default value of NOW. The 
 patch required users to be off the system during installation but 
 because it installed immediately during working hours it triggered 
 NOSOURCE errors in the system error log.
 Fix: Added a screen to require the time to be in the future.
  
 NOIS: BUT-0801-21662/HD-8287,CHG-2698
 Problem: Install did not install every thing because user doing the 
 install didn't have full FileMan privilege. (DUZ(0)="@")
 Fix: Temporally give user DUZ(0)="@" for install.
  
 NOIS: ISB-1198-31382/CHG-2500
 Problem: KIDS does not DELETE AT SITE when requested to do so for
 HL LOWER LEVEL PROTOCOL PARAMETER, HL LOGICAL LINK, or MAIL GROUP.
 Additionally, installer is prompted to supply a coordinator for a 
 MAIL GROUP, even when it is marked as DELETE AT SITE.
 Fix: Add delete code for HL LOWER LEVEL PROTOCOL PARAMETER and HL LOGICAL LINK.
  
 NOIS: ISW-0300-23271/CHG000000002743
 Problem: Some functions like assembling the list of routines and moving
 them into the Build sets up large, local arrays, so large as to cause an
 abend with an allocation error.
 Fix: File the data at least every 100 entries.
  
 ESS: CHG000000002735
 Problem: Note that although Data Comes With File was edited to NO, 
 values in logically related fields Site's Data, Resolve Pointers, May 
 User Override Data Update, and Screen to Select Data were not cleared of 
 their values even though the pop-up window for editing these field only 
 appears if Data Comes With File is answered YES, and so there is an 
 understood relationship (i.e. values in these fields make no sense if 
 the answer is NO to Data Comes With File)
  
 Maybe the data would not be picked up, but the Build is misleading to the
 viewer and the Build serves as valuable documentation for patches.  The
 developer has to use work around of while value is YES, to @ sign each of the
 populated fields in the pop-up window before changing Data Comes With File to
 NO.
 Fix: Have code in the form reset the fields when the SEND FULL OR PARTIAL 
 DD (#222.3) is changed to Partial.  Only works in the ScreenMan Form.
  
 NOIS: BRX-1299-11244
 Problem: The build print KIDS option is not displaying all the fields. 
 Especially, the one time run routine deletion fields. DELETE ENV ROUTINE, 
 DELETE PRE-INIT ROUTINE, DELETE POST-INIT ROUTINE.
 Fix: Changed routine XPDDP to print the fields.
  
 Added two fields to the ROUTINE file (#9.8) and the code to fill them.
 1. KIDS INSTALL DATE (#7.4) to track when KIDS loads routines. 
 2. PATCH (#8) a multiple to track the checksum of a routine for each 
 patch when a KIDS transport is made.

 List of preceding patches: 124, 137, 184, 201
 Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.
  
 =========================================================================
 Installation:
  
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
  
   1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
  
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
       non-peak time.
       This patch can be queued and installed at any time.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   5.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*229'
                              ==========
         
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
         
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
  
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
       
   6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
