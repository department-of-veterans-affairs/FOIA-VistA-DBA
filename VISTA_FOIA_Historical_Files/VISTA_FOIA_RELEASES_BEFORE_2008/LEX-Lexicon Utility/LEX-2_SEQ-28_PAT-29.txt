Description:
============

  This patch exports CPT Modifier Pairs, DMIS IDs, and selected abbreviations
  for clinical terminology.  It also contains several fixes for NOIS and E3R 
  reports.
 
  ENHANCEMENTS
  ============
 
     Modifier Pairs
 
         The annual 2004 update to modifiers that may be used with CPT 
         (Current Procedural Terminology) and HCPCS (Healthcare Common 
         Procedure Coding System) codes are provided with this patch. 
         These modifier pairings are supplied by Ingenix (the designated
         authoritative source for modifier pairs) and provide the only 
         valid pairs (i.e., linked codes and modifiers) that may be used
         to encode special circumstances which adjust or modify codes. 
 
         Note: This data is part of Informational patch ICPT*6.0*18 and
         exported with Lexical Services under patch LEX*2.0*29.
 
     DMIS IDs
 
         The Lexicon provides translation of DMIS Identifiers.  DMIS IDs
         represent the Department of Defense (DoD) identifying numbers,
         names, and installations for each treatment facility, catchment
         area, or other entity used by DoD to uniquely identify sites of
         care. This patch provides an update (i.e., adds new sites and 
         modifies existing site information) for all DoD medical treatment
         facilities as of March 2004. 
 
     Abbreviations
 
         Members of the Coding Council provided 176 common medical 
         abbreviations to assist users in identifying applicable 
         International Classification of Diseases - Clinical Modification,
         9th Revision, (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses codes. These abbreviations 
         have been included with this patch to aid in the search 
         functionality of the Lexicon.
 
  NOIS/E3R SUMMARY
  ================
 
    The date in file 81.2 was not updated to               NOIS AUG-0204-32253
    reflect the latest version of CPT/HCPCS                     ASH-0204-31578
    codes.  This caused the reports from
    the ICPT OUTPUT MENU to return incorrect 
    data.  With this patch, the date in file 
    81.2 has been updated to Jan 1, 2004.
    
    The Lexicon expression "Gait, Limp" was                NOIS BIL-1203-30691
    incorrectly coded at ICD 443.9.  443.9
    refers to "Peripheral Vascular Disease,
    Unspecified."  "Gait, Limp" has been 
    re-coded to 781.2, "ABNORMALITY OF GAIT".
    
    When the diagnosis "hypogonadism" is entered           NOIS LEX-0204-41676
    in the search, it only returns female 
    related diagnosis (no male related diagnosis).
    The keyword "HYPOGONADISM" has been added to
    male related diagnosis, such as "Other 
    Testicular Hypofunction".
    
    The ICD code E915. exists with the correct             NOIS SAG-1203-41852
    description in the ICD DIAGNOSIS file.  When an
    attempt is made to add a problem in CPRS (which 
    uses the Lexicon), it returns the wrong description.
    E915. has been linked with the correct term 
    "Foreign Body Accidentally entering other Orifice"
    as the preferred term in the Lexicon (instead of 
    "hairball").
  
    When searching for 'HYPOGONADISM' the Lexicon          NOIS SAG-1103-40488
    responds with one (1) term instead of a list of 
    relevant terms.  The keyword "HYPOGONADISM" was 
    added to selected expressions to assist in the 
    data retrieval, resulting in a list of terms to
    select from.  A similar condition existed for 
    "PULMONARY HYPERTENSION" and was also fixed by 
    adding keywords to assist the lookup.
    
    When the Lexicon performs a "lookup by code", it       NOIS PHO-0104-60329
    does not honor the user's default display parameter.
    The lookup has been changed to make use of the
    default display, with one exception, that is when 
    the code that is found is not of a code type contained
    in the default display string.
 
    CPT code 88112 had the wrong long description          NOIS CIN-0404-40409
    in file 81.  This has been replaced with 
    "CYTOPATHOLOGY, SELECTIVE CELLULAR ENHANCEMENT
    TECHNIQUE WITH INTERPRETATION (EG, LIQUID BASED
    SLIDE PREPARATION METHOD), EXCEPT CERVICAL OR 
    VAGINAL" A similar fix was made to the Lexicon.
    
    The ICD code for "Macrocytosis" in Lexicon was         E3R 18827
    inactivated, and no longer available to calling
    applications.  "Macrocytosis" has been re-coded 
    as ICD 289.89 (an active ICD code) and can now
    be accessed by calling applications.

   FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
   =======================
  
     Global Host File:                  LEX_2_29.GBL  (ASCII)
    
     The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
   
     The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
     location at the following locations.
    
          Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
          Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
          Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
          Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
             
   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
  
        1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*29.
            It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
            hours.  This patch should take less than 10 minutes to install.
    
        2)  Review your mapped set.  If LEXABC, LEXXGI, and LEXXGI2 are
            are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at this
            time.
  
            >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
   
            If you have installed LEX*2.0*29 into another account, and the 
            Lexicon global ^LEX is translated into the current account,
            you may go directly to step 8 of the installation instructions.
        
            It is not necessary to install the data more than once per 
            translation.
                                                                           
            >>>>>>>  IMPORTANT <<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>  IMPORTANT  <<<<<<<<<
      
        3)  Backup the following globals before continuing:
     
                  CPT                  #81           ^ICPT(
                  CPT COPYRIGHT       #81.2          ^DIC(81.2
                  CPT MODIFIER        #81.3          ^DIC(81.3,
                  Lexicon           #757-757.41      ^LEX(
  
        4)  Make sure that the remnants of a previous import global do
            not exist on your system.  If the global ^LEXM does exist, you 
            will need to kill this global before proceeding.
     
              To kill the unsubscripted global ^LEXM:
     
                DSM    
     
                  K ^LEXM
     
                Cache
     
                  The prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system
                  wide setting, but can be allowed for a particular process
                  using the $ZU command.  The command for enabling 
                  unsubscripted global kills is:
     
                    VAH>S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
                    VAH>K ^LEXM
     
                  The command for disabling unsubscripted kills for a process
                  is S X=$ZU(68,28,1); however, halting out of the process and
                  creating a new process will achieve the same effect.
     
        5)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_29.GBL.  This 
            file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
    
              DSM
     
                Use ^%GTI and the input device LEX_2_29.GBL
     
              Cache/NT and Cache/VMS
            
                Cache v2.1.6 - Global Restore
     
                We recommend that the GUI Thin Client be used to restore the
                global.  Be sure to select the VAH namespace in the "Global 
                Utilities" window.  Make sure that you select the global host
                file LEX_2_29.GBL (File / Open) before changing the file 
                format.  With the namespace and file selected, change the 
                restore file format to VAX DSM.
   
                Cache v3.2 - Global Restore
   
                Using the Cache 3.2 Thin Client, right click on the Cache 
                cube, then select "Explorer."  Open the "Namespaces" folder,
                then open the "VAH" folder, and right click on the "Globals"
                folder. Select the "Import from disk" option. Click on the
                "Options..." button.  Select the "Globals" tab, make sure 
                the format is VAX DSM, then click "OK." Find the file in the
                directory, double click on LEX_2_29.GBL. Next, select "Import
                All" at the prompt "Do you wish to restore '^LEXM'," select
                "Yes."
     
                Using the GUI utilities will prevent an <ENDOFFILE> error when
                restoring a global saved under DSM  (usually seen when using 
                the CHUI %GI utility to restore a DSM global).
     
            The loading of the global should take from 1 to 2 minutes.
    
        6)  Turn journaling off for globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM.
     
              DSM
      
                Use ^%GLOMAN
                For the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
                Select "Change Journaling Capabilities"
                Select "D" for "Disabled"
     
             Cache/NT
   
               Cache v2.1.6 - Journaling
     
               We recommend using the GUI System Operations Utilities.  
               Select the database where the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
               reside using the Databases tab (to find out where a global
               resides use the GUI global utility directory tab).  Then 
               select the menu item Action / Database / Global attributes.
               In the Attributes and Journaling window, click on the 
               "Globals" button.  Select the globals ^LEX, ^LEXT and ^LEXM
               (note the "All Globals" check box needs to be unmarked to 
               select a specific global).  Make sure the check box under 
               the column heading "Journal" is unmarked for the ^LEX, ^LEXT
               and ^LEXM globals and then click "OK."
   
               Cache v3.2 - Journaling
   
               Using the Cache v3.2 Thin Client, right click on the Cache 
               cube, then, select "Control Panel."  Open the "Local 
               Databases" folder, then open the folder where the ^LEX* 
               globals reside. Right click ^LEX, select "Properties," and
               uncheck the "Journal global" box.  Repeat for ^LEXT and ^LEXM
               globals.
   
             Cache/VMS
                
               It is not possible to disable journaling for individual files
               on Cache/VMS systems. Caution should be exercised with regard
               to the amount of journal space that may be required.
     
        7)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
    
        8)  Distribution Load:
    
            Load the Distribution from the Packman Message using the Packman 
            function "Install/Check Message."
    
              Environment Check:  
        
                Only package components and system variables will be checked 
                during the loading of the transport global.
    
        9)  KIDS Installation:
    
            Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action 
            "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*29.  The KIDS
            installation should take less than a minute (with journaling 
            off) depending on the number of users/jobs on the system.
    
              Environment Check:  
     
                LEX*2.0*29 data exists (by global translation):
   
                  If the data for LEX*2.0*29 has been installed and is
                  translated into the current account, then only package 
                  components and system variables will be checked.
   
                LEX*2.0*29 data does not exist:
   
                  If the data for LEX*2.0*29 can not be found (either in 
                  the current account or by translation) then the environment
                  check routine will verify the import global ^LEXM by build
                  namespace and global checksum.  This is to insure that the
                  correct import global is loaded and that all of the data 
                  contained in the import global arrived at your site during
                  the FTP transfer.  If you have inadvertently loaded the 
                  wrong import global or the global fails the checksum, the
                  install will stop and you will need to kill ^LEXM and FTP
                  another copy of the import global (see the section on FTP
                  Software Retrieval and step 4 of the Installation 
                  Instructions).
              
            Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
            install? YES//" prompt.
      
            Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Schedule Options, Menu 
            Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
    
       10)  Cleanup
    
            a)  Check that the export global ^LEXM has been killed 
                automatically. 
     
                If it has not been automatically killed you will need to 
                kill the "unsubscripted" import global ^LEXM to prevent 
                import global checksum errors on future installations.
                (see step 5 for "unsubscripted" kills)
     
            b)  If journaling was turned off in step 6 for the ^LEX and
                ^LEXT globals, turn journaling back on.
     
                DSM
     
                  Same instructions as in step 6 except select "E" for 
                  "Enabled"
     
                Cache/NT and Cache/VMS
   
                  Same instructions as in step 6 except make sure the 
                  check box under the column heading "Journal" is marked
                  for the ^LEX and ^LEXT globals.
   
            c)  If Lexicon routines were unmapped as part of step 2 above, 
                then they should be returned to the mapped set once the 
                installation has run to completion.
 
            d)  Routines LEX2029 and LEX2029P may be deleted from your
                system upon completion of the installation.  These are
                the environment check and post-install routines.
