Description:
============

 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*67 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA
 DIRECTIVE 99-053 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*67 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*67 have no effect on Blood Bank
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 ========================================
  
 This patch adds support for Laboratory Point of Care (POC) interfaces.
 It utilizes existing functionality provided by Laboratory Universal
 Interface (UI) and Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) software.
 It supports the transmission, processing and storing of POC test results
 in the VistA Laboratory package. The ability of POC interfaces to subscribe
 to VistA HL7 ADT messages for patient demographics and location information
 is provided as needed. Support for 5 separate POC interfaces is provided.
  
  
 NOTE: THIS PATCH WILL BE INSTALLED WITH PATCH LR*5.2*290
  
  
 1. NOIS DAN-0105-41616/Remedy HD0000000071211 reported undefined DUZ("AG")
 variable when processing Lab HL7 messages. The following new 'non-human'
 entries will be installed in NEW PERSON file (#200). These entries have
 the approval of VA VistA Data Base Administrator.
  
  NAME: LRLAB,HL             NAME COMPONENTS: 200
   SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME: HL LRLAB
  
  NAME: LRLAB,POC            NAME COMPONENTS: 200
   SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME: POC LRLAB
  
 User LRLAB,HL will be used by Laboratory when processing HL7 messages
 to insure a consistent Kernel environment with respect to the system-wide
 DUZ variable array.
  
 User LRLAB,POC will be used by Laboratory when creating POC orders and
 accessions to indicate that these orders and accessions were created by
 the POC interface background process. Sites should assign to the user
 LRLAB,POC those divisions that will be used by POC interfaces to accession
 POC results into VistA Laboratory package.
  
  
 Additionally, the following changes have been made:
  
 2. Removed prompt to save alert when viewing lab messaging alert in routine
 LA7UXQA. This functionality is now part of Kernel Alert processing.
  
 3. When logging lab messaging processing errors, FileMan DIE call in
 routine LA7LOG was converted to FileMan DBS call.
  
 4. Lab messaging will now check that LA7TASK NIGHTY option is scheduled
 in TaskMan. If not scheduled then an alert notifying members of mail group
 LAB MESSAGING will be generated. The alert message will read "Lab Messaging
 - Option LA7TASK NIGHTY is not scheduled in TaskMan". Documentation
 regarding tasking can be found in the VistA Laboratory LEDI User Guide and
 on-line via the DESCRIPTION field of the OPTION file (#19) for this entry.
  
 5. Result of 'canc' was not being processed if the test was configured to
 only accept 'final' type results (HL7 Table 0085 - Observation result
 status codes interpretation codes C, F, or U. Changed routine LA7VIN5A to
 accept and process "canc' result with status code X.
