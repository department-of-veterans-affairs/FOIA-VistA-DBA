Description: 
============

  GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
  =================== 
  This patch includes routines, protocols, options, list templates and
  remote procedures.
  
  FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
  ========================
    
   The Completion Time Statistics Report:
   
      The report now uses the date requested as the start date instead of 
      the file entry date.
    
      A new report for a different service can now be created without 
      returning to the VistA menu.
   
      A report can now be generated by service groupers with statistics for 
      the grouping service as well as the sub-services.
   
      The total number of consults completed now equals the sum of the 
      inpatient and outpatient totals with the inclusion of those consults 
      that are considered "unclassified" (those not marked as inpatient or 
      outpatient).
   
      The "Pharmacy Consult User" and the "Medicine Consults Management" 
      options will not ask for the service and will create the report for 
      those services for all dates.
   
      The new Print Completion Time Statistics Report will allow users to 
      print the report to a device without building and displaying the 
      report with List Manager first.  
   
   Service Consults By Status Report(s):
   
      There are several new status reports that allow users to generate 
      service consults as follows:
  
             Service Consults Completed
             Service Consults Completed or Pending Resolution
             Service Consults with Consults Numbers
             Service Consults By Status
             Print Service Consults By Status
  
      Three of the reports use variations of the Pending Resolution and 
      Completed status.  All reports include three new actions that allow 
      the user to change the status, change the service, and toggle the 
      consult number on/off within in the List Manager display.  The status 
      reports can be generated by the following status:
  
                     al       All Status's
                     ap       All Pending
                     dc       Discont.
                     c        Completed
                     p        Pending
                     a        Active
                     s        Scheduled (NEW)
                     pr       Incomplete
                     x        Cancelled
   
      The new Print Service Consults by Status Report will allow users to 
      print the report to a device without building and displaying the 
      report with List Manager first.  
  
      A report can now be generated by service groupers with statistics for 
      the grouping service as well as the sub-services.
   
      Corrections were made to the display of results in List Manager.  When 
      a new service is selected, the display returns to the first screen.  
      The screen numbers in the upper right of the screen now display the 
      correct screen and number of screens.
   
      Remote procedures have been added to retrieve both of these reports.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  
  Before installation of this patch verify that there are no local
  modifications to the OPTION MENU "GMRC REPORTS".  This menu and all 
  supporting options will be replaced and any local modification will
  have to be added back in.
  
  The installation will take about 5 minutes with the exception of the
  post-Install Routine which will remove and rebuild the "AE" cross
  reference of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) which may take some
  time.
  
  
  Please install this patch at non-peak hours.
  
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
  2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation menu.
  
  3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package GMRC*3.0*7
  
  4. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? YES//" You may want to reply "NO" do to the time required to 
     rebuild the Menu Tree and do the rebuild at a later time.
  
  5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// 
     respond NO.
  
  6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//", respond YES.  Disable the following two options:
  
       GMRC RPT PENDING CONSULTS
       GMRC COMPLETION STATISTICS
  
  POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===============================
  A POST install routine "GMRC7L" will be executed during the install that 
  will also call another routine (POST^GMRCSUBS).  GMRC7L will be removed 
  after the install.  This routine was required to install one of the List 
  Templates that KIDS would not do.
  
  Run the option "Duplicate Sub-Service [GMRC DUPLICATE SUB-SERVICE]" on
  the "Consult Management ... [GMRC MGR]" menu.  This will list any
  Requesting Services that are sub-services of more than one Service.
  These should be changed so that a Requesting Service is a sub-service of
  only one Service.
