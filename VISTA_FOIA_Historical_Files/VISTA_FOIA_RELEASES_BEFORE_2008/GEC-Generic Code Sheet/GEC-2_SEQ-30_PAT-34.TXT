Subject: BATCH NUMBERING SCHEME LIMITED TO 1000

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch increases the number of possible unique batch numbers that can 
 be generated for modified billing documents being sent to FMS from 1000 
 to 12250.

 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 -------------
 1. HD0000000056319     PAL-0704-60353     Can 1000 line limit be increased
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The issue reported was when more than 1000 transactions (modified billing
    documents) are sent to Facility Management Support (FMS) they begin to
    reject as duplicates.  The problem was identified as the batch numbers 
    inability to handle over 1000 transactions.  The Generic Code Sheets 
    auto numbering utility can generate numbers ranging from 1 to 9999999.  
    This would be fine, except that only the last three numbers get used in 
    the batch number.  They are attached to the end of the three digit station 
    number (STN###).  Since, only 3 digits are used for modifying the batch 
    number, this current numbering system tops out at 1000 different number 
    combinations.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A new auto numbering utility has been created to use alphanumeric in
    such a way to increase the total count of different number combinations
    to approximately 12250.  This is achieved by using the station number
    followed by a digit ranging from 0-9, followed by a second and third
    digit each containing a number between 0-9 or an alphabetic character
    ranging from A-Z (except O).  The letter "O" was not used to prevent
    confusion with zero.  The new numbering sequence is as follows:
  
 (The letter O is not used to prevent confusion with zero in the following
  number scheme)
  
    1-998     increment by 1 number
    999       increment to 00A
    00A-98A   increment by 1 number
    99A       increment to 00B, and so on to 99Y
    99Z       increment to 0AA
    0AA-0AY   increment last character to next alphabetic character
    0AZ       increment to 0BA, and so on to 9ZY
    9ZZ       increments to 1
