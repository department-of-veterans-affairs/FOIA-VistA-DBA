Subject: ENCAPSULATION CYCLE 1 ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will contain enhancements to the cycle 1 encapsulation APIs. 
  
 A change has been made to the DIC^PSSDI and MIX^PSSDI components of DBIA 
 4551. DIC("S") will be killed within these components. Two new input 
 parameters have been added to address screening issues. If the file you
 are passing in has an INACTIVATION DATE field, and you want to screen on 
 that field, a new date input parameter is being added to the components, 
 and if a date is passed in, a screen will be set for the calling
 application. If the file you are passing in is the DRUG file (#50), and 
 you want to screen on the APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE field (#63), a new 
 input parameter has been added for that also.
  
 A new component, FNAME^PSSDI has been added to DBIA 4551. This component 
 will return the LABEL attribute of the Field passed into the call.
  
 Patch PSS*1*92 adds the SERVICE CODE field to the output of the DATA^PSS50
 component of DBIA 4533, however a problem still exists where this field is
 not being returned if a "??" value is passed into the call. This patch
 corrects the problem.

  Documentation Retrieval:
  ========================
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the first
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly
  from a specific server as follows:
   Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
   Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
   Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  The documentation includes:
  
   FILE NAME                        DESCRIPTION
   PHAR_1_API_R0206.PDF             Updated Pharmacy Re-Engineering API 
                                    Manual
  
  Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA Documentation
  Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
  http://www.va.gov/vdl
  
  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch exports a routine that is a supported reference, so any other 
  Vista application can make a call to this routine. For that reason, it is
  recommended that this patch be installed when Vista activity is at a 
  minimum.
  
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should be
     removed from the mapped set at this time.
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*104)
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*104.
   
  6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
   
  8. When prompted "Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
   
  9. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
     to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.
