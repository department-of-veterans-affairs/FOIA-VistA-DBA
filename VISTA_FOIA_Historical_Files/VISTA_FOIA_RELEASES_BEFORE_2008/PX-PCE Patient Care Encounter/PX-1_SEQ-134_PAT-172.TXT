Subject: PCE USERS ALLOWED TO ACCESS THEIR OWN RECORD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem which exists with several different PCE
 protocols which allow a user to access their own record.  This is
 prohibited by security regulations.

 REMEDY/NOIS TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===========================
 HD63518 - PCE Users allowed to access their own record
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Several PCE protocols currently allow users to access their own
     record when the user is also a patient in the Vista system.  This
     would apply to protocols:  Display Detail, Update Encounter and
     Check Out Interview.  This problem only occurs when the user enters
     PCE Encounter Data Entry by a selected clinic in which the user has
     or had an appointment.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routines PXCEAE, PXCEEXP, PXCEINTR and PXCESDAM will be modified so
     that when applicable, a user will not be allowed to access their own
     medical record.  Instead, the following message will display:
     "Security regulations prohibit computer access to your own medical
     record."  They will then be returned to the main screen.
